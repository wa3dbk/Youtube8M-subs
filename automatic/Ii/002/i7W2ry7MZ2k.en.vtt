first<00:01:51.000> things<00:01:51.299> we'll<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> look

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
first things we'll do is is kind of look

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.690 
first things we'll do is is kind of look
at<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> plant<00:01:54.119> itself<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:55.369> what<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
at the plant itself and see what is it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
at the plant itself and see what is it
that<00:01:56.729> looks<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.140> growing<00:01:58.439> well

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that looks like it's not growing well

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
that looks like it's not growing well
and<00:01:59.219> what's<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.000> shaded<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> not

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and what's going to be shaded and not

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.490 
and what's going to be shaded and not
going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> receive<00:02:02.759> enough<00:02:03.060> sunlight<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.259> one

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
growth and there's not too many new

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.530 
growth and there's not too many new
canes<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.550> here<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:37.910> I'm<00:02:38.000> gonna<00:02:38.090> leave<00:02:38.300> that

for the moment this one is an old cane

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.960 
for the moment this one is an old cane
it's<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.040> right<00:02:43.190> place<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.849> gonna

it's not in the right place it's gonna

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.780 
it's not in the right place it's gonna
get<00:02:44.150> shaded<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:45.950> kind<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.280> crossing

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
get shaded and it's kind of crossing

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.110 
get shaded and it's kind of crossing
over<00:02:46.940> some<00:02:47.239> other<00:02:47.450> teams<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.640> one<00:02:52.819> thing<00:02:53.000> you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
over some other teams so one thing you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.449 
over some other teams so one thing you
want<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.930> make<00:02:54.080> sure<00:02:54.110> if<00:02:54.470> you've<00:02:54.620> got<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.830> drip

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
want to make sure if you've got a drip

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.900 
want to make sure if you've got a drip
line<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.209> not<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.480> cut<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.780> drip<00:02:57.019> line<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.819> you

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
line and not to cut the drip line so you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.509 
line and not to cut the drip line so you
make<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> clean<00:02:59.450> cut<00:02:59.480> like<00:03:00.079> that<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.310> also

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
make a clean cut like that this is also

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.970 
make a clean cut like that this is also
coming<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.599> will<00:03:06.049> intercept<00:03:06.650> some

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
coming out this will intercept some

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.100 
coming out this will intercept some
light<00:03:07.250> here<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.269> that's<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:08.989> very

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
light here but that's it's very

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.620 
light here but that's it's very
unthrifty<00:03:10.099> we<00:03:10.579> do<00:03:10.760> have<00:03:10.940> some<00:03:11.209> new<00:03:11.390> growth

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
unthrifty we do have some new growth

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.289 
unthrifty we do have some new growth
here<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.380> here<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.700> type<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.120> new

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
here and here that that type of new

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.059 
here and here that that type of new
growth<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.959> small<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.769> not<00:03:15.950> gonna

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
growth is so small that it's not gonna

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.610 
growth is so small that it's not gonna
really<00:03:16.280> produce<00:03:16.579> any<00:03:17.000> fruit<00:03:17.239> okay

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
really produce any fruit okay

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.340 
really produce any fruit okay
this<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.299> upper<00:03:20.540> part<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.840> much<00:03:21.049> better

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
this up on the upper part is much better

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.280 
this up on the upper part is much better
I'm<00:03:21.799> just<00:03:22.100> going<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.280> cut<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.730> off

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.589 

just<00:03:25.860> leave<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.280> leave<00:03:26.819> this<00:03:27.030> here<00:03:27.360> it's

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
just leave that leave this here it's

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.550 
just leave that leave this here it's
crap<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:29.129> this<00:03:29.400> case<00:03:29.700> let's<00:03:30.659> just<00:03:30.870> take<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.349> look

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
crap in this case let's just take a look

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.720 
crap in this case let's just take a look
at<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.829> one<00:03:32.010> here<00:03:32.159> we've<00:03:32.310> got<00:03:32.489> some<00:03:32.700> really

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
at this one here we've got some really

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.599 
at this one here we've got some really
good<00:03:33.150> growth<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.750> then<00:03:34.379> it<00:03:34.500> splits<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.310> goes

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
good growth and then it splits and goes

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.490 
good growth and then it splits and goes
off<00:03:35.849> this<00:03:36.120> way<00:03:36.359> it's<00:03:36.510> kind<00:03:36.689> of<00:03:36.719> crossing<00:03:37.319> over

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
off this way it's kind of crossing over

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.039 
off this way it's kind of crossing over
but<00:03:38.340> it's<00:03:38.489> it's<00:03:38.879> got<00:03:39.209> some<00:03:39.450> good<00:03:39.629> growth<00:03:39.870> on

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
but it's it's got some good growth on

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.479 
but it's it's got some good growth on
the<00:03:40.140> end<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.620> think<00:03:40.769> I'm<00:03:40.950> gonna<00:03:41.040> leave<00:03:41.250> that

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the end so I think I'm gonna leave that

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.099 
the end so I think I'm gonna leave that
for<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.790> year<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.359> here's<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:42.689> little<00:03:42.989> bit

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
for this year but here's a little bit

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.830 
for this year but here's a little bit
that's<00:03:43.739> kind<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:44.220> middle<00:03:44.540> these<00:03:45.540> will

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
that's kind of in the middle these will

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.809 
that's kind of in the middle these will
continue<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.500> grow<00:03:46.739> these<00:03:47.010> these<00:03:47.519> little

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
continue to grow these these little

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.729 
continue to grow these these little
pieces<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.390> I've<00:03:48.629> cut<00:03:48.840> off<00:03:49.019> will<00:03:49.260> continue

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
pieces that I've cut off will continue

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.740 
pieces that I've cut off will continue
to<00:03:49.859> grow<00:03:50.069> into<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.579> middle<00:03:50.879> because<00:03:51.569> this

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
to grow into the middle because this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.569 
to grow into the middle because this
robbed<00:03:52.049> energy<00:03:52.590> from<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.859> rest<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> plant

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
robbed energy from the rest of the plant

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:04.159 
robbed energy from the rest of the plant
okay<00:03:54.090> it'll<00:03:54.569> be<00:03:54.659> shaded<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> lot<00:04:04.139> of

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
okay it'll be shaded and so a lot of

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.830 
okay it'll be shaded and so a lot of
this<00:04:04.349> little<00:04:04.919> small<00:04:05.909> stuff<00:04:06.209> can<00:04:06.419> be<00:04:06.450> cleaned

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
this little small stuff can be cleaned

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.319 
this little small stuff can be cleaned
up<00:04:07.019> with<00:04:07.049> some<00:04:07.349> hand<00:04:07.590> pruners<00:04:08.209> what<00:04:09.209> you

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
up with some hand pruners what you

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.000 
up with some hand pruners what you
really<00:04:09.629> want<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.930> do<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.200> clean<00:04:10.560> out<00:04:10.590> this

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
really want to do is clean out this

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.490 
really want to do is clean out this
middle<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.730> allow<00:04:11.970> sunlight<00:04:12.510> penetration<00:04:13.109> and

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
middle to allow sunlight penetration and

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
middle to allow sunlight penetration and
air<00:04:13.950> flow<00:04:14.280> which<00:04:14.549> will<00:04:14.700> reduce<00:04:14.879> fungal

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
air flow which will reduce fungal

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.339 
air flow which will reduce fungal
disease<00:04:16.289> problems<00:04:17.180> this<00:04:18.180> one<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.840> dead

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
disease problems this one is is dead

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.909 
disease problems this one is is dead
back<00:04:20.209> down<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:21.989> want<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.199> cut<00:04:22.349> it<00:04:22.470> back<00:04:22.650> to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
back down so you want to cut it back to

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.779 
back down so you want to cut it back to
where<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.250> still<00:04:23.490> alive<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.789> actively

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
where it's still alive and actively

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.650 
where it's still alive and actively
growing

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.350 

this<00:04:34.660> here<00:04:35.110> going<00:04:36.070> into<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.580> middle<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.520> how

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
this here going into the middle and how

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.660 
this here going into the middle and how
long<00:04:40.600> can<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.110> put<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.410> continue<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.430> prune

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
long can you put that continue to prune

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.380 
long can you put that continue to prune
the<00:04:42.880> blueberries<00:04:43.450> into<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.710> spring<00:04:45.400> you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
the blueberries into the spring you

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.270 
the blueberries into the spring you
should<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:47.230> should<00:04:47.260> do<00:04:47.560> all<00:04:47.800> your<00:04:48.010> pruning

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
should you should do all your pruning

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.190 
should you should do all your pruning
before<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:49.060> buds<00:04:49.270> start<00:04:49.630> breaking<00:04:50.050> open

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
before the buds start breaking open

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.990 
before the buds start breaking open
because<00:04:50.980> once<00:04:51.190> they<00:04:51.370> start<00:04:51.610> doing<00:04:51.880> that

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
because once they start doing that

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.150 
because once they start doing that
they'll<00:04:52.240> be<00:04:52.330> producing<00:04:52.780> flowers<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.980> then

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
they'll be producing flowers and then

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.950 
they'll be producing flowers and then
once<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.430> if<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.150> start<00:04:55.420> pruning<00:04:55.630> when<00:04:55.870> they

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
once you if you start pruning when they

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:08.690 
once you if you start pruning when they
have<00:04:56.110> flowers<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:57.190> may<00:04:57.340> knock<00:04:57.610> them<00:04:57.790> off<00:04:58.000> okay

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.510 

and<00:05:09.700> again<00:05:09.850> these<00:05:10.150> are<00:05:10.210> gonna<00:05:10.540> be<00:05:10.720> shaded<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
and again these are gonna be shaded the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.270 
and again these are gonna be shaded the
ones<00:05:12.700> they're<00:05:12.970> growing<00:05:13.270> on<00:05:13.420> right<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.280> it's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
ones they're growing on right and it's

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.700 
ones they're growing on right and it's
going<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.640> take<00:05:15.940> probably<00:05:16.540> a<00:05:16.870> couple<00:05:17.140> years<00:05:17.560> to

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
going to take probably a couple years to

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.590 
going to take probably a couple years to
get<00:05:17.830> this<00:05:18.010> back<00:05:18.250> into<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.880> shape<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.390> we

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
get this back into the shape that we

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.290 
get this back into the shape that we
want<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.140> be<00:05:20.290> well<00:05:21.100> it'll<00:05:21.610> be<00:05:21.760> important<00:05:22.210> to

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
want it to be well it'll be important to

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.830 
want it to be well it'll be important to
do<00:05:22.510> all<00:05:22.540> the<00:05:22.810> pruning<00:05:23.110> but<00:05:23.530> also<00:05:23.920> get

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
do all the pruning but also get

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.780 
do all the pruning but also get
fertilizer<00:05:25.840> on<00:05:26.230> this<00:05:26.670> something<00:05:27.670> that's

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
fertilizer on this something that's

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.030 
fertilizer on this something that's
probably<00:05:28.030> acidic<00:05:28.780> like<00:05:28.960> an<00:05:29.110> ammonium<00:05:29.500> sulfate

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
probably acidic like an ammonium sulfate

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.850 
probably acidic like an ammonium sulfate
okay<00:05:30.730> and<00:05:31.120> also<00:05:31.570> make<00:05:31.900> sure<00:05:32.050> it's<00:05:32.170> watered<00:05:32.620> and

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
okay and also make sure it's watered and

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.130 
okay and also make sure it's watered and
should<00:05:33.820> do<00:05:33.910> its<00:05:34.060> sole<00:05:34.270> test<00:05:34.540> every<00:05:34.840> couple<00:05:35.110> of

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
should do its sole test every couple of

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.530 
should do its sole test every couple of
years<00:05:35.200> to<00:05:35.650> make<00:05:36.400> sure<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.640> pH<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.210> at<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.420> good

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
years to make sure the pH is at a good

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.410 
years to make sure the pH is at a good
level<00:05:37.780> good<00:05:38.680> level<00:05:38.980> I<00:05:39.070> mean<00:05:39.220> between<00:05:39.460> four

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
level good level I mean between four

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.440 
level good level I mean between four
five<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:41.050> five<00:05:41.290> five<00:05:41.320> okay<00:05:42.280> very<00:05:42.550> acid<00:05:42.910> loving

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
five and five five okay very acid loving

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.680 
five and five five okay very acid loving
plants<00:05:43.900> right<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:45.460> let's<00:05:45.640> move<00:05:45.820> along<00:05:46.120> here

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
plants right so let's move along here

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.040 
plants right so let's move along here
and<00:05:47.260> we've<00:05:48.040> seen<00:05:48.370> on<00:05:48.880> this<00:05:49.270> plant<00:05:49.660> there's

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
and we've seen on this plant there's

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.870 
and we've seen on this plant there's
some<00:05:50.350> older<00:05:51.280> canes<00:05:51.700> like<00:05:52.500> these<00:05:56.220> bark<00:05:57.220> and

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
some older canes like these bark and

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.320 
some older canes like these bark and
then<00:05:58.870> there's<00:05:59.110> some<00:05:59.350> more<00:05:59.980> middle<00:06:00.580> aged<00:06:00.880> type

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
then there's some more middle aged type

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.920 
then there's some more middle aged type
of<00:06:01.510> things<00:06:01.750> like<00:06:02.170> these<00:06:03.510> and<00:06:04.510> that's<00:06:04.660> what<00:06:04.810> we

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
of things like these and that's what we

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.060 
of things like these and that's what we
want<00:06:05.110> we<00:06:05.200> want<00:06:05.470> to<00:06:05.590> have<00:06:05.770> three<00:06:06.040> different

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
stages older middle and then the very

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.750 
stages older middle and then the very
young<00:06:09.580> ones<00:06:09.850> that<00:06:10.090> are<00:06:10.180> coming<00:06:10.510> up<00:06:12.930> very<00:06:13.930> green

young ones that are coming up very green

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.970 
young ones that are coming up very green
smooth<00:06:15.760> bark<00:06:16.150> on<00:06:16.720> here<00:06:17.170> we'd<00:06:17.440> like<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.800> have<00:06:17.920> a

okay as we continue to do this over the

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.980 
okay as we continue to do this over the
next<00:06:24.700> couple<00:06:25.090> of<00:06:25.270> years<00:06:25.330> we're<00:06:25.780> going<00:06:25.930> to

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
next couple of years we're going to

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.110 
next couple of years we're going to
strive<00:06:26.320> to<00:06:26.350> getting<00:06:26.890> younger<00:06:27.430> shoots<00:06:27.850> and

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
strive to getting younger shoots and

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.430 
strive to getting younger shoots and
getting<00:06:28.360> rid<00:06:28.510> of<00:06:28.600> some<00:06:28.810> of<00:06:28.840> this<00:06:28.960> other<00:06:29.200> stuff

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
getting rid of some of this other stuff

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.260 
getting rid of some of this other stuff
I<00:06:29.860> think<00:06:30.070> right<00:06:30.310> eventually<00:06:30.880> you<00:06:30.970> like<00:06:31.120> to

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
I think right eventually you like to

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.140 
I think right eventually you like to
cycle<00:06:31.540> out<00:06:31.870> of<00:06:32.020> all<00:06:32.170> that<00:06:32.350> old<00:06:32.560> old<00:06:33.460> shoots<00:06:33.850> and

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
cycle out of all that old old shoots and

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.500 
cycle out of all that old old shoots and
have<00:06:34.990> just<00:06:35.170> a<00:06:35.350> continual<00:06:36.100> read<00:06:36.330> renewal<00:06:37.330> of

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
have just a continual read renewal of

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.549 
have just a continual read renewal of
different<00:06:37.960> shoots<00:06:38.170> coming<00:06:38.500> up<00:06:38.710> okay

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559 
different shoots coming up okay

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.009 
different shoots coming up okay
and<00:06:40.649> you<00:06:41.639> mentioned<00:06:42.059> fertilizer<00:06:42.569> what<00:06:42.899> else

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:43.019 
and you mentioned fertilizer what else

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:46.279 
and you mentioned fertilizer what else
can<00:06:43.289> we<00:06:43.379> do<00:06:43.559> to<00:06:43.919> help<00:06:44.909> our<00:06:45.299> blueberries<00:06:45.929> plant

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
can we do to help our blueberries plant

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.889 
can we do to help our blueberries plant
plant<00:06:46.589> thrive<00:06:47.149> one<00:06:48.149> of<00:06:48.239> the<00:06:48.329> main<00:06:48.539> things<00:06:48.779> you

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:48.899 
plant thrive one of the main things you

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:51.769 
plant thrive one of the main things you
can<00:06:49.019> do<00:06:49.169> is<00:06:49.319> mulch<00:06:49.649> it<00:06:49.919> and<00:06:50.579> see<00:06:51.479> you've<00:06:51.599> got

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:51.779 
can do is mulch it and see you've got

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.109 
can do is mulch it and see you've got
some<00:06:51.809> some<00:06:52.619> malts<00:06:52.949> here<00:06:53.159> some<00:06:53.459> pine<00:06:53.819> bark

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:54.119 
some some malts here some pine bark

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:55.909 
some some malts here some pine bark
mulch<00:06:54.419> works<00:06:54.869> well<00:06:55.169> something<00:06:55.589> that's<00:06:55.769> very

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
mulch works well something that's very

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.239 
mulch works well something that's very
acidic<00:06:56.309> okay<00:06:56.939> and<00:06:57.379> you<00:06:58.379> have<00:06:58.559> to<00:06:58.709> renew<00:06:58.889> that

00:06:59.239 --> 00:06:59.249 
acidic okay and you have to renew that

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.539 
acidic okay and you have to renew that
probably<00:06:59.699> every<00:07:00.179> year<00:07:00.509> and<00:07:01.379> that<00:07:02.339> will<00:07:02.429> help

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:02.549 
probably every year and that will help

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:05.719 
probably every year and that will help
keep<00:07:02.639> the<00:07:02.879> pH<00:07:03.089> down<00:07:03.479> as<00:07:03.779> well<00:07:04.079> as<00:07:04.729> eliminate

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
keep the pH down as well as eliminate

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.489 
keep the pH down as well as eliminate
the<00:07:05.909> weeds<00:07:06.119> now<00:07:06.869> the<00:07:06.929> weeds<00:07:07.259> are<00:07:07.469> a

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:07.499 
the weeds now the weeds are a

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.339 
the weeds now the weeds are a
significant<00:07:08.039> problem<00:07:08.309> for<00:07:08.519> blueberries<00:07:09.449> they

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.349 
significant problem for blueberries they

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:11.569 
significant problem for blueberries they
just<00:07:10.559> don't<00:07:10.769> have<00:07:10.889> really<00:07:11.039> strong<00:07:11.369> root

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:11.579 
just don't have really strong root

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.819 
just don't have really strong root
system<00:07:11.609> for<00:07:12.179> competing<00:07:12.689> with<00:07:12.839> weeds<00:07:13.109> so<00:07:13.769> it

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:13.829 
system for competing with weeds so it

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:15.769 
system for competing with weeds so it
needs<00:07:13.979> to<00:07:14.069> be<00:07:14.159> weed<00:07:14.609> free<00:07:14.969> around<00:07:15.329> the<00:07:15.539> plant

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:15.779 
needs to be weed free around the plant

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:19.639 
needs to be weed free around the plant
okay<00:07:16.409> and<00:07:17.209> I've<00:07:18.209> been<00:07:18.809> reading<00:07:19.199> a<00:07:19.289> little<00:07:19.439> bit

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:19.649 
okay and I've been reading a little bit

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.379 
okay and I've been reading a little bit
and<00:07:19.829> I<00:07:19.919> find<00:07:20.189> that<00:07:20.279> blueberries<00:07:20.969> actually

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 
and I find that blueberries actually

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:22.639 
and I find that blueberries actually
there's<00:07:21.539> quite<00:07:21.599> a<00:07:21.779> bit<00:07:21.959> of<00:07:22.049> water<00:07:22.199> is<00:07:22.469> it

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:22.649 
there's quite a bit of water is it

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:25.999 
there's quite a bit of water is it
correct<00:07:22.979> they<00:07:23.519> do<00:07:24.139> one<00:07:25.139> of<00:07:25.259> their<00:07:25.409> the<00:07:25.769> things

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009 
correct they do one of their the things

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.559 
correct they do one of their the things
about<00:07:26.249> blueberries<00:07:26.609> is<00:07:26.849> they<00:07:26.999> have<00:07:27.179> no<00:07:27.329> root

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569 
about blueberries is they have no root

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.019 
about blueberries is they have no root
hairs<00:07:27.839> on<00:07:28.139> their<00:07:28.379> root<00:07:28.589> system<00:07:29.099> so<00:07:29.819> they<00:07:29.999> have

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:30.029 
hairs on their root system so they have

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.059 
hairs on their root system so they have
a<00:07:30.269> little<00:07:30.599> bit<00:07:30.749> harder<00:07:31.019> time<00:07:31.259> taking<00:07:31.709> up<00:07:31.829> water

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:32.069 
a little bit harder time taking up water

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:34.639 
a little bit harder time taking up water
than<00:07:32.429> something<00:07:32.699> with<00:07:33.059> with<00:07:33.809> root<00:07:34.049> hair<00:07:34.289> so

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:34.649 
than something with with root hair so

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:37.339 
than something with with root hair so
they<00:07:34.829> need<00:07:35.039> to<00:07:35.159> have<00:07:35.369> that<00:07:35.549> water<00:07:36.169> directly<00:07:37.169> at

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349 
they need to have that water directly at

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.429 
they need to have that water directly at
the<00:07:37.559> base<00:07:37.709> of<00:07:37.889> the<00:07:37.979> plant<00:07:38.249> and<00:07:38.599> so<00:07:39.599> and<00:07:40.259> they

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:40.439 
the base of the plant and so and they

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.839 
the base of the plant and so and they
can<00:07:40.619> use<00:07:40.769> it<00:07:40.919> quite<00:07:41.069> a<00:07:41.129> bit<00:07:41.339> because<00:07:41.489> they<00:07:41.699> put
