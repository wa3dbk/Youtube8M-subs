chorale I feel like I'm just touching

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.109 
chorale I feel like I'm just touching
the<00:01:27.210> surface<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> capacity<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.890> has

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
the surface of the capacity that it has

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.310 
the surface of the capacity that it has
but<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> things<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.049> like

but that's one of the things I like
about<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.189> don't<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.030> learn<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
about it is you don't have to learn the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.260 
about it is you don't have to learn the
whole<00:01:33.509> program<00:01:34.020> order<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.270> could

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
whole program order to use it you could

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
whole program order to use it you could
go<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> could<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
go in there and you could use just a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.760 
go in there and you could use just a
couple<00:01:37.950> brushes<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> could<00:01:38.790> paint<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
couple brushes and you could paint I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.219 
couple brushes and you could paint I
love<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.040> there's<00:01:41.509> further<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
love that there's further to go in it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
love that there's further to go in it
that<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.040> layers<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.729> haven't

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that there's more layers that I haven't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.889 
that there's more layers that I haven't
even<00:01:45.299> discovered<00:01:46.079> yet<00:01:47.270> when<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> started<00:01:48.750> in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
even discovered yet when I started in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410

that was being done in Corel and I knew

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
that was being done in Corel and I knew

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that was the program that I wanted to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.760 
that was the program that I wanted to
learn<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.360> loved<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> freedom<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.439> gives

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

I have complete freedom within Corral

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.330 
I have complete freedom within Corral
because<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.120> tools<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.750> affords

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340

there<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.460> quote<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.850> my<00:02:17.030> website<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.780> it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
there is a quote on my website and it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.320 
there is a quote on my website and it
says<00:02:18.050> art<00:02:18.680> exists<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.970> we<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
says art exists so that we know that

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.870 
says art exists so that we know that
we're<00:02:20.660> not<00:02:20.690> alone<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.280> think<00:02:22.490> that's<00:02:22.670> such

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
we're not alone and I think that's such

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.870 
we're not alone and I think that's such
a<00:02:22.910> profound<00:02:23.540> simple<00:02:24.380> statement<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.190> it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
a profound simple statement and it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.730 
a profound simple statement and it
speaks<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.080> connection<00:02:27.470> that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
speaks of just that connection that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.260 
speaks of just that connection that
happens<00:02:28.160> when<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.460> look<00:02:28.640> at<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> piece<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.030> art

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
happens when you look at a piece of art

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.720 
happens when you look at a piece of art
that<00:02:29.690> speaks<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.380> personally<00:02:31.010> there's<00:02:31.610> a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
that speaks to you personally there's a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.150 
that speaks to you personally there's a
connection<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> subject<00:02:33.080> matter<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
connection to the subject matter to the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.480 
connection to the subject matter to the
