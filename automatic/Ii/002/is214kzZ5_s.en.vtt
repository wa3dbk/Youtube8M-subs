00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.919
 I am sam and in this video we go 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.410
 look at a new app for those five 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.910
 and for that phase is not an app that 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.220
 no reviewing at all but just a moment 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.000
 Quick view because I think so 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.679
 perhaps one of the nicest apps 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.079
 what this year and maybe was like before 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.660
 has already entered the market next year 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.119
 for the price an app where you get all sorts 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.909
 yes how do you actually say templates 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.359
 say can open and then to it 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.640
 colors 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.250
 make faces too naps too 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.739
 we make christmas trees make whatever 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.930
 you just choose a format say and 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.370
 then you can go it in colors and 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.140
 of editing 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.340
 according to print and then we go to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.629
 watch and go alone is one 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.059
 make pop song 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.019
 I speak this later in makes this whole 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.359
 movie 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.649
 both shoot when we work as 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.629
 upload via the ipad 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.679
 so it is once different than via 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.300
 the computer 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.760
 but body was covered the male 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 made green eyes on it 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.929
 of course choose a nice mouth from me 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.609
 I set them up seemingly to include one 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.920
 sometime funny as you can see 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.780
 so work on templates that you can see 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.630
 where what ends up 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.710
 a few arms through also good according to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.909
 I already know that I have the arm 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.170
 in the end not so much like that 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.369
 I'm still would soon be replaced by a 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.720
 another arm 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.270
 but we can still do that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.100
 further talk about some foil 5 for that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 often a reddish washes on this 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.750
 moment a promotion offer it is 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.369
 really available since today and what and 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.350
 The intention is that you all kinds 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.140
 can experience cysts 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.820
 can cut out and fold printing and then 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.219
 do you have a man at a given moment 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.590
 big ones are now too 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.659
 point that I found that poor 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.700
 what i want on mommy this is you 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.020
 again just a demo of course 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.360
 show it 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.890
 and once they have the doll ready 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.200
 have a mouth like my will 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.600
 so we can shift a little bit 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.280
 send to the printer 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.409
 you can also send it as a pdf so that 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.000
 you can open it yourself on computer 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.799
 but if you have a play printer there the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.869
 I have such a print that works wirelessly 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.350
 then you can just send from here to 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.350
 the printer 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 well then that's just a matter of me 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.119
 printer waiting for it 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.069
 until it is ready and then it is one 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.410
 matter of cutting 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.690
 make sure you neatly cut out 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.310
 it becomes a suggestion of folding and 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.349
 make sure you pritt it with a piece 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.450
 stick together and then you have 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.980
 just funny dolls you can the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.020
 make Christmas baubles you can 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.790
 you can do anything with it 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.440
 and if you get a little better at cutting and folding 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.610
 then you can also do very beautiful things 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.310
 experience it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.800
 well that's a school that phi phi phi 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.140
 store around your models and you can do it 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.090
 sharing via the online option is you 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.310
 can also be dolls from other people or 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.580
 we see creations from other people here 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.830
 equally malt mossberg from all teams that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.569
 wall street journal and that's how you can do it 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.450
 I increase mailing myself or immediately 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.019
 so that you can make someone happy 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.519
 can make 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.739
 I can not wait until I shouted something 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.420
 in steve jobs you have to use in 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.880
 review 'is of course for android 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.330
 versus ios well you can do extensions 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.489
 to buy 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.100
 some costs a tweeter some costs 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.540
 a euro or now of 89 cents 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.299
 so you just have all sorts of options 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.709
 to join with those five 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.900
 as far as I'm concerned this is really one of them 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.359
 best apps that you can do for children 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.100
 buy if you have the ipad and then you can 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.260
 tinkering wonderfully during the Christmas holidays 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.780
 and aster then combines with apps like 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.950
 imovie and he stop motion 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.290
 then you can make the nice movies with 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 wash it again until next time
