00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.150
 little bit these traits that maybe not 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.740
 you know of Jonathan there are some yes and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.270
 others do not and with that surely

 you will learn a little more about this 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.830
 mythical character within the world apple 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.129
 jonathan pollard was born in 1967 in the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.690
 town of ching fort in london where 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.390
 He was also educated by his father during 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.910
 much of adolescence without a doubt 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.269
 also a reference for him since good 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.250
 He instilled in her that passion for design that 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.769
 has been so characteristic jonathan 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.480
 Haitian so we know him iph was the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.329
 that convinced Apple and that will affect 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.239
 their designs Apple devices 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.589
 in white jonathan ay would happen to 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.379
 be part of the appple template 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.080
 in 1992 as artistic director of the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.420
 company but it was not until the return of 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.890
 jobs to it when it really could 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.110
 show everything that has demonstrated 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.700
 the time so maybe that second 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.229
 passing them by the company is what 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.080
 really marked the before and after in 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.979
 the stage of johnny there is fenapol in the year 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.710
 2006 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.930

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 named the most influential British of 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.380
 the us for some still what 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.549
 it continues being during his studies 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.079
 university students all in the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.850
 universities also dedicate their time 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.620
 to do little things in free time 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.810
 jonathan there was dedicated to 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.450
 design electronic products as they are 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.300
 for example television video recorders 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.660
 phones watches even 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.820
 health products the first job 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.610
 of Jonathan Knight was in the study of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.710
 industrial design of tangerine that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.680
 project that participated in the design of the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.690
 apple and jonathan power book there is almost 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.270
 stop working on apple right after 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.160
 the return of steve jobs but it was jon 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.840
 rubinstein the one that convinced him then with 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.250
 a much more seductive contract 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.780
 who has those moments and good too 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.200
 a talk that motivated him a lot 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.450
 continue in the company currently has 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.110
 596 design and utility patents in the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.190
 which figure as an inventor and innovator 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.000
 one of the first projects 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.490
 University of Natan there was a bathroom 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.920
 good but here where you see him then no 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.610
 trick is more failure this project 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.350
 because let's say the client believed that 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.480
 construction as well he ultimately 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.670
 after a project too expensive 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.860
 jobs always friend the innate talent of 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.090
 jonathan to such an extent that all the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.190
 apple people 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.650
 I thought it would be the next CEO of the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.269
 good company guys, well, nothing 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.680
 here this video I greet you as if 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.090
 I was saying hello and I'm really 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.980
 saying goodbye but I'm that tired 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.660
 I say that nothing I have said that we 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.920
 we see in the next video that we hope 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.019
 that you have liked already you know that to gaby 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.269
 he likes you to say that they tell me 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.769
 you like and I think for him so you can 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.180
 I like to call them a thousand 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.170
 I like how we have arrived in the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.180
 sections of the previous weeks 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.190
 You can leave your proposal for 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.360
 next week's videos even though they 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.970
 advances that may be related to 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.040
 the gum I leave there so nothing 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.989
 we see tomorrow in another video because this 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.680
 toad five for one I 'm fernando and 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.680
 I promise to do it 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.720
