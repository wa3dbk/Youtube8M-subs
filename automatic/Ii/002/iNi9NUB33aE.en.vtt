00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
louder I think in the SEC because of the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
louder I think in the SEC because of the
design<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.870> stadiums<00:01:04.409> everybody<00:01:05.220> knows

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
about the team speed that these teams

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
about the team speed that these teams
have<00:01:08.030> they<00:01:09.030> overlook<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> linemen<00:01:09.930> sometime

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
have they overlook the linemen sometime

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.539 
have they overlook the linemen sometime
but<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.650> teams<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.130> aggressive

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.070 
everything about the SEC is aggressive
and<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.630> years<00:01:15.810> its

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and that's and I think for years its

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
and that's and I think for years its
inspired<00:01:16.530> college<00:01:17.040> football<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.240> that's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
inspired college football and and that's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.940 
inspired college football and and that's
what<00:01:18.990> makes<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> greatest

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
