 their 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.650
 when I was a child I especially liked the stories of fear 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.520
 for example 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.040
 the vials of Antwerp 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.970
 mapion courier influenced 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.600
 from the images 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.170
 here I come to mind and design the masks 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.199
 for impressions 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.199
 I hang with my life 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.030
 as a movie 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.610
 can say shivering 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.650
 climates needed 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.980
 a video of mine my Mario shows very well 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 which still does very nice things 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.430
 here idiot he or maybe a little 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.520
 learned this bust of horror 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.850

 here are these images 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 perhaps 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.760
 the meeting a cuva 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 in some of my stories 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.200
 for example the dungeons 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 that people of 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.120
 bald men waxing 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.350
 which represent a bit 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.240
 the hidden world 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.780
 they live indeed 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 in the underground depths 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.989
 it man 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.019
 I would say above the other face of my characters in 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.879
 if we want to use 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.129
 some words 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.540
 closer to psychoanalysis we could speak of in co 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.369

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.349
 apparent use of nonsense 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.480
 in the veins of an ibiza literature referable admire witchcraft and have 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.089
 most obvious surrealist lesson

 valentina dorian gray manacore 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.409
 without contractions 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.409
 logical dream sequence 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.139
 because a woman as the protagonist of her sims 3 pets stories 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.859
 photo simply seemed to me 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.819
 a new thing even if really m20 no was not the first woman but there was 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.229
 barbarella 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.699
 which, however, was always projected outwards, we say very extrovert 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.749
 valentina is a little contrary introverted she thinks of herself and dreams and always 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.069
 facing inward 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.869
 feast is evil tendinitis what they think of this female character 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:08.889
 worth feminists 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.339
 they even gave me a little bit what I mean 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.030
 just because valentina 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.609
 cdo to be 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.609
 really fb is me 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 perhaps feminists will not forgive me for being 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:29.120
 keys maybe if valentina had been drawn by a woman 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.449
 perhaps they would have found all the arguments because they were there 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.210
 it would be enough to read the stories, for example, what infinite usually do not me 

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.829
 seems true
