 on pascal retro games in this little 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.450
 report on a video game store 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.430
 retro to new york called 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.630

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.220
 very well his name and as you can 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.950
 see it from the entrance there we are in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.509
 the entrance there is video game 2 everywhere 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.290
 look at this little showcase well 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.480
 nice 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.340
 that's enough who's in the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
 simplicity so this store there that 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.690
 you unlike the nintendo workshop 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.829
 which is another type of store you 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.480
 not at all in the stuff we're going 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.280
 tell the american super big but 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.390
 rather in a very familial side and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.050
 warm that I appreciate enormously 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.480
 look in simplicity 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.129
 people are super cool and the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.399
 sellers of course down are nice 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.710
 as well 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.050
 there for example I filmed me not under 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.719
 the 1 here are the words say hello they 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.289
 are very much at your service this is it 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.390
 very very nice and there look 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.890
 the choice of floor to ceiling 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.500
 soldiers crates and up to the ceiling 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.350
 you have video game shelves and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.780
 there is really everything from there 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.259
 are born from the super of genesis and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.409
 megadrive of the saturn you have everything 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.960
 everything from 3d to here look at me 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.369
 that then you have loose people like 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.350
 you can see it where in the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.409
 crates down below that's not the see the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.850
 game crates and you have a promo 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.829
 launch there was a promo it was worth 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.479
 really worth it for games purchased 1 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.700
 free finally if you buy two days 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.630
 we offer you a third 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.140
 so here on the way I take three games 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.520
 you only country of that it was nice and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 here was watching the shock there was also 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.659
 of course so the famous retro 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.210
 etc. 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.770
 but there are other things 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.510
 there is frankly there is a small 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.800
 little of everything and 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.620
 I found that the choice was really 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.910
 great there quickly who is in France I 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.490
 think a few years ago there 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.870
 had it maybe not so bulky 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.770
 but look at it and hop here I borrow a 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.920
 other corridor looks like a small 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.500
 labyrinth not very big but with a 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.280
 Phenomenal choice of play there we are in 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.590
 the nintendo 64 and there look at everything 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.490
 that there is boxing as we can 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.050
 see there whaou in very very good condition and 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.590
 you also have prices rather 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.500
 correct a frankly that's sixty 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.570
 nine dollars that would do in the 55 I 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.150
 do not know how many euros exactly but 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.950
 I think it's worth it 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.810
 cheap nor give a pure and honest 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.340
 I made the comparisons it's a 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.800
 little rush of normal rib prices 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.300
 so it's cool and men is the interest 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.310
 from this store the hall to that is naomi 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.050
 so a small one that I had that 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.720
 I had watched I would be people 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.200
 of which 36 when I tell my life a two 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530
 little trips to little james and that I 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.080
 welcomes 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.520
 no but includes french bat sailing 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.790
 so is there you watched all the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.340
 choice of the game boy and wadi of the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.270
 gameboy 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.920
 some rates are a bit expensive 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.030
 others are more accessible after 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.850
 the ag really did not understand how they 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.230
 do their cotton to be honest that c 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.760
 was pretty baffled sometimes by 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.110
 some prices that seemed dearly elected 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.730
 who were rather given I tell myself I 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.800
 am not understood by game games 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.170
 giroud the game there had been a game in 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.360
 loose which was not highly rated but 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.970
 who was expensive and then you had a 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.560
 canned version of another game that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.730
 was almost given so that must 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.680
 certainly also be in relation to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.550
 stock that are going more and more and there 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.060
 look at the saturn of the saturn jap 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.130
 and also a 3d fuction 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.030
 here is the help of the atari allart ya de 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.290
 everything there is 2 to 2 to 2 to 2 to and there 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.380
 in there are some boxed versions the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.030
 smoker and so there he looked hop there 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.230
 look at that from the jaguar 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.160
 there was not much for games 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.170
 but it has the merit of being 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.700
 present so if you want to buy yourself 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.320
 dumas all here is the famous saturn 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.000
 who as many know I do you 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.770
 return my video on my channel from the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.210
 best console in the world 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.010
 that's for me it's the saturn you 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.230
 did a review and a top of games 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.370
 saturn that you can find so 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.670
 in my playlist if you do not 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.810

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.950
 he looked at the go there it was it was 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.690
 james believe he was telling me ben look 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.010
 regagna pokemon do not know what he is 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.340
 pokemon fan so here we go 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.320
 there's something I enjoy watching 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.390
 so let's look at the video villas there that 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.280
 me it even remakes me makes such a 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.190
 such a thing before what is it 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.240

 I wanted to get your attention - 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.380

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.350
 to film one because it was not very 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.420
 big and a little graphic core that 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.970
 pleased me for one of my 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.380
 eyes this is the ceni of ascsb kings

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.669

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.140
 category of 8 bits su plus + and the 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.000

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.160
 real treat and there we can see also in 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.800
 see it's full of everywhere really 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.360
 kind of after a while there are the 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.590
 look what I do not like what to say 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.780
 look at my head how I look 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.760
 happy here it's just that I look 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.260
 happy and I was like a little child 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.370
 in this little retro game shop 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.720
 there were some in France and some 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.979
 years but that was not so in 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.240
 choice was not that much 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.250
 really there I can tell you that it's 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.810
 it's not enormously, it's not 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.789
 tiny either but it's very very 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.580
 intense in sight so here I am finished 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:00.789
 with his images of genesis 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.580

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.830
 for prices it's okay in 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.479
 frankly there it was the props 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.590
 are not very expensive after put all this 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.380
 in a suitcase to return to France 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.599
