00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 carnival time party time and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.759
 yummy desserts you know among mine 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.429
 favorite carnival sweets are there 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.679
 surely the donuts though around you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.170
 find especially inflicted hydrate 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 heavy for heavy lands I don't love them 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.750
 just for nothing 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.090
 then today I would like to offer you some 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 light but light seeley donuts 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.949
 really glories with potatoes and no blue 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.529
 we see an idea about 500 grams of 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.920
 potatoes only 450 500 g of Manitoba flour 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.899
 12 grams of fresco yeast 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.579
 100 millimeters of water 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.969
 a new 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:45.149
 80 g of sugar lemon zest a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.410
 pinch of salt to brush an album 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 and to stuff 150 g of jam for 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 serve icing sugar as required and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 let's start with the preparation then for 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.910
 first thing we have to wash the le well 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 le sweet potatoes or brushed with a 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 brush precisely to remove all 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.900
 leftover dirt and then I boiled 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.610
 in unsalted water for about 40 minutes 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.439
 I recommend taking some potatoes 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.860
 of more or less regular dimensions for 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.240
 therefore have even homogeneous cooking 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 now I have abolished them 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350
 warm the whim slightly 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 peeling with the knife then I go to 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 crush them like potato masher i vi 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.869
 I recommend using potatoes 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.640
 sweet because I formulated the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.380
 recipe though if you don't find them or not 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 you want to use them anyway 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.700
 replace them with the classic potatoes 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.340
 ok in the latter case however there is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 I also suggest to increase a little 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.299
 amount of sugar because the potatoes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.100
 Americans have precisely the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.030
 characteristic of being rich in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.030
 simple carbohydrates 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.090
 here we are, therefore I have crushed the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.640
 sweet potatoes and I got 400 g of 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.870
 boiled meat just to give you all 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.350
 how many women 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.450
 let's put aside let's go to dissolve 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
 the fresh brewer's yeast which are 12 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 grams in warm water 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.070
 alternatively you can also use 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:12.370
 dry yeast 4 g 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.290
 we mix now I'm flavoring the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.480
 sweet potato puree with peel 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.860
 of lemon 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.930
 you can also use vanilla 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 if you prefer but I think the contrast 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.250
 with excellent lemon for this 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.620
 We combine the sugar 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.350
 I repeat then if you use potatoes 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.790
 normal dose increased by 50 grams 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.820
 of sugar if used instead 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.710
 sweet potatoes are fine 80 85 g 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.300
 always taste that senseless wide 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:49.140
 it also depends on how sweet they are 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:49.140
 potatoes we put an egg and mix 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:59.439
 we adjust salt suffered 1 and then 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.359
 add as much Manitoba flour as it is 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.700
 enough to get a mixture 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.340
 soft mouldable with your hands in one 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.780
 pc what it has and in the middle we add the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.780
 our yeast dissolved in water 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.659
 mix first with the spoon 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.760
 of wood and then by hand on a pastry board e 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:27.159
 naturally we also add oil 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:29.260
 4 tablespoons extra virgin or so obtained 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.969
 a nice soft dough balls e 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.340
 not a tiring and I recommend not 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.639
 work the dough too long because 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.389
 if they are the potatoes elaborating it 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.340
 continuously what happens in the 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.199
 potatoes would require flour which 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.209
 involves hardening also 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.370
 the final dough then a little bit 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.719
 quickly when you hear that pasta 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.730
 the mind is no longer sticky 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.169
 inside the bowl we cover with 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.629
 a sheet of transparent film 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.569
 we are born to rise in a lukewarm port 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.120
 the ideal in the oven off males trust for 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.909
 the note for about 2 or 3 hours up to 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.739
 when Dr. in volume life here we are 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.419
 here after three hours of leavening in 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.280
 this result 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.280
 now let 's renew the most free e 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.409
 we begin to spread it on the plan of 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.599
 we dirty the floor with a bit of work 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.680
 flour the mixture will be rather 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.120
 sticky due to the presence of potatoes 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.520
 and potatoes, in fact, as I said before 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.449
 they continue or rather tend to absorb 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.110
 you prepare flour you see that it is me 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.330
 was already in the hands is normal 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.349
 we remove well 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.819
 do not regret I love the dough we put a 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.069
 bit of flour 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:51.069
 we begin to tie it with our hands and it is 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:52.659
 as soft and elastic and then with the 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.860
 rolling pin to a medium thickness 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:59.020
 centimeter even a little less 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.689
 I have now taken a pastry cutter with a diameter 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.129
 the edge of a 7 cm is also fine 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.780
 glass 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.599
 let's make discs that later 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.069
 we will place on one or two oven plates 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.069
 always lined with paper 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.810
 we thus obtained 16 bases plus 16 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.889
 covers 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.960
 now we have to try to paste the 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.289
 two parts before stuffing them like 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.210
 glue we will use in the boom and not 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:33.990
 we assemble it slightly or better 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:36.969
 mix a little with a fork and then 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:44.979
 with a brush we go to brush i 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:47.229
 edges of the bases once brushed 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.779
 edges we are going to fill in chosen one 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.639
 jam goes well than strawberries' dwellings 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.680
 apricots the one you like best 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.909
 or even with custard o 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.909
 with the hazelnut spread 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.839
 once stuffed we take the other one 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.879
 diskette we spread a little with the 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.750
 hands trying to make it fit the 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.419
 Better possible 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.659
 so let's do a little practice 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:13.330
 always press along the edges we give one 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.599
 nice shape and let's proceed with everyone 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.599
 the others 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.060
 and now we must do nothing but 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.070
 let rise in an environment 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.919
 lukewarm about our donuts 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.960
 an hour or so after about an hour of 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.120
 leavening see how they have become 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.980
 giant our donuts now already 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.960
 pre heated your but 180 degrees 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.210
 we are going to cook them immediately for 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.980
 about 15 20 minutes 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.530
 see you guys don't need to tighten up for 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.990
 make greedy sweets this net o 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.060
 then a try as you give a little 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.190
 absolute softness I don't know if they are the 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.080
 potatoes or the combination of ingredients but 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.820
 they are fabulous so they already have 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.979
 sprinkle some with sugar a 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.870
 veil 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.550
 now I put some sugar less 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.960
 even here private immediately smile to 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.960
 my friends good carnival
