00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.340
 good good my black is going down a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.020
 good field tutorial in the chapter of 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.020
 today we are going to see the for zion 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.700
 tai mention these two devices are 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.460
 they look very similar because they do very 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.450
 very similar first a little bit of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.710
 requirements 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.020
 ask for 124 thousand 288 watts which I have 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.780
 translated to 28 by entangle a lot 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.350
 less than this but the more energy 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.500
 we give you we get closer by 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 that I gave him more in this case I left 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.320
 do one of radio 5 as you can see there 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.320
 are we going a test are you going to see that 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.450
 with respect to the arrows 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.180
 but because I have more for them 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.180
 you can not see your dog 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.390
 we'll see 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.430
 the monster can leave but can not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.030
 entering is a force field that does not stop 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.030
 enter the other entities modes 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.260
 the contain film is the same but to the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.190
 inverse 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:24.280
 let's see it requires a little less than 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:28.950
 of energy 131 thousand 72 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.950
 this is 101 and 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.330
 As you can see, do not let the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.330
 bugs 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.140
 and there they are all jumping 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 it is a containment that does leave 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.010
 transfer to the arms 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.010
 good to see totally through 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.320
 demonstrate the recipe a little 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.740
 field and here we have finally requires 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.330
 be that we can do all three 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.330
 heads as if we were going to do 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.890
 widder but a bowl and a star without 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.890
 to struggle 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.290
 blue pencil diamonds and the other one is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.270
 media blue pin and you need a little the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.650
 people that's all for 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.860
 it's very funny everything is going to be the fields 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 these from here 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.000
 just turn it off 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.650
 good 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.990
 he survived the area here so 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.850
 I hope for sure 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.900
 subscribe in comments and see you the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.900
 next territorial goodbye
