the word short staple cotton by me

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
the word short staple cotton by me
nothing<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> brag<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.809> ever

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
nothing to brag about right if you ever

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
nothing to brag about right if you ever
see<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> label<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.770> cotton<00:00:41.129> thread<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.399> says

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
see a label on cotton thread that says

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.950 
see a label on cotton thread that says
100%<00:00:42.149> cotton

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
100% cotton

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.369 
100% cotton
guess<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.739> staple<00:00:44.160> length<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:45.379> always

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
guess what staple length it is always

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.520 
guess what staple length it is always
because<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> long<00:00:48.140> they<00:00:49.140> will<00:00:49.289> brag

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because if it is long they will brag

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.560 
because if it is long they will brag
about<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.879> price<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.329> higher

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
about it and that the price is higher

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.709 
about it and that the price is higher
that's<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> bragging<00:00:53.070> point<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:54.390> really

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
that's the bragging point it really

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
that's the bragging point it really
doesn't<00:00:55.170> matter<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> length<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.280> the
