mine points and when your MP runs out
your<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.409> mind<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:06.149> dismissed<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.079> seems

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
your are mind will be dismissed it seems

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
your are mind will be dismissed it seems
like<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.829> far<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> balance<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.879> amiss

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like so far that the balance is amiss

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.360 
like so far that the balance is amiss
pretty<00:02:09.330> about<00:02:09.539> managing<00:02:10.379> your<00:02:10.530> mind<00:02:10.890> points

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
pretty about managing your mind points

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.150 
pretty about managing your mind points
to<00:02:12.000> make<00:02:12.209> sure<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.900> your<00:02:13.170> mind

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
to make sure that your mind

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.340 
to make sure that your mind
doesn't<00:02:14.370> leave<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.850> field<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.420> know<00:02:15.570> because

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
doesn't leave the field you know because

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.290 
doesn't leave the field you know because
each<00:02:16.650> turn<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.160> lose<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> little<00:02:17.670> bit<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.030> mind

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
each turn you lose a little bit of mind

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
each turn you lose a little bit of mind
points<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.960> watch<00:02:19.140> all<00:02:19.320> your<00:02:19.440> my<00:02:19.680> points<00:02:20.130> goes

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
points and watch all your my points goes

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.770 
points and watch all your my points goes
out<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.910> said<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:21.530> mind<00:02:22.530> itself<00:02:23.310> is

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
out like I said your mind itself is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.810 
out like I said your mind itself is
dismissed<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.890> seems<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.460> have<00:02:26.490> to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
dismissed so it seems that you have to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.210 
dismissed so it seems that you have to
balance<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.390> between<00:02:27.750> some<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.830> your<00:02:29.040> mind

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
balance out between some of your mind

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.310 
balance out between some of your mind
using<00:02:29.670> attacks<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.210> defending<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.810> charge<00:02:31.080> up

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
using attacks and defending to charge up

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.460 
using attacks and defending to charge up
more<00:02:31.650> mind<00:02:32.060> now<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.330> also<00:02:33.540> attack<00:02:34.140> with

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
more mind now you can also attack with

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.100 
more mind now you can also attack with
the<00:02:34.620> characters<00:02:35.460> in<00:02:35.670> general<00:02:35.700> using<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.840> mind

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the characters in general using the mind

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.410 
the characters in general using the mind
but<00:02:37.890> attacking<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.460> them<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.850> course<00:02:39.180> you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
but attacking with them of course you

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.610 
but attacking with them of course you
know<00:02:39.570> their<00:02:39.810> attacks<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.290> rather<00:02:40.470> weak

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
know their attacks are rather weak

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.920 
know their attacks are rather weak
compared<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> mind<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.210> they're<00:02:42.780> just

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
compared to the mind and they're just

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
compared to the mind and they're just
weaker<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.530> general<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.520> will<00:02:45.000> take

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
weaker in general and they will take

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.920 
weaker in general and they will take
more<00:02:45.390> damage<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.110> once<00:02:46.530> their<00:02:46.770> arm<00:02:47.270> HP<00:02:48.270> or<00:02:48.450> LP

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
more damage and once their arm HP or LP

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.900 
more damage and once their arm HP or LP
Life<00:02:49.170> Points<00:02:49.410> go<00:02:49.710> out<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.250> they're<00:02:50.670> dead

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
Life Points go out you know they're dead

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.910 
Life Points go out you know they're dead
of<00:02:51.090> course<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:52.080> get<00:02:52.380> hit<00:02:52.590> pretty<00:02:52.800> hard

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
of course and they get hit pretty hard

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.310 
of course and they get hit pretty hard
so<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.880> want<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> summon<00:02:54.450> your<00:02:54.660> mind<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.140> to

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
so you want to summon your mind is to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.710 
so you want to summon your mind is to
pretty<00:02:55.500> much<00:02:55.590> do<00:02:56.040> battle<00:02:56.550> for<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
pretty much do battle for you and you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.140 
pretty much do battle for you and you
don't<00:02:57.930> want<00:02:58.110> them<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.710> be<00:02:58.890> dismissed<00:02:59.610> at<00:02:59.880> all

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
don't want them to be dismissed at all

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.750 
don't want them to be dismissed at all
so<00:03:00.720> juggling<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.440> factor<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.640> know<00:03:02.730> I

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so juggling that factor in you know I

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.100 
so juggling that factor in you know I
can<00:03:02.970> see<00:03:03.150> there<00:03:03.330> will<00:03:03.390> bethe<00:03:03.570> definitely<00:03:04.050> be

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
can see there will bethe definitely be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.960 
can see there will bethe definitely be
status<00:03:04.500> alignment<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.220> will<00:03:05.400> prevent<00:03:05.790> me

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
status alignment that will prevent me

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.850 
status alignment that will prevent me
for<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.330> many<00:03:06.390> months<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.050> have<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.560> really

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
for so many months you have to really

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.310 
for so many months you have to really
you<00:03:08.190> know<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:09.000> your<00:03:09.210> mind<00:03:09.480> out<00:03:09.720> there<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.200> make

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
you know get your mind out there to make

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.440 
you know get your mind out there to make
sure<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.770> can<00:03:10.950> attack<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.670> being<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> ones

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
sure they can attack and being the ones

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
sure they can attack and being the ones
to<00:03:12.750> take<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.380> blow<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.950> most<00:03:14.190> attacks<00:03:14.550> and

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to take the blow for most attacks and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.030 
to take the blow for most attacks and
when<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.510> get<00:03:15.690> attacked<00:03:16.020> actually<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.740> mind

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
when they get attacked actually the mind

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.760 
when they get attacked actually the mind
points<00:03:17.490> also<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.090> down<00:03:18.360> as<00:03:18.540> well<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.440> yeah<00:03:19.650> like

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
points also go down as well so yeah like

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.500 
points also go down as well so yeah like
I<00:03:19.920> said<00:03:19.950> before<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.910> juggling

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
I said before it's like this juggling

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.780 
I said before it's like this juggling
you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.870> your<00:03:22.620> mind<00:03:22.920> points<00:03:23.370> making<00:03:23.580> sure

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you know your mind points making sure

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.340 
you know your mind points making sure
you<00:03:23.880> have<00:03:24.000> enough<00:03:24.030> mana<00:03:24.510> points<00:03:24.900> guarding

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
you have enough mana points guarding

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.710 
you have enough mana points guarding
when<00:03:25.530> your<00:03:25.650> mind<00:03:25.830> points<00:03:26.160> get<00:03:26.400> low<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.600> can

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
when your mind points get low so you can

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.500 
when your mind points get low so you can
recover<00:03:28.080> some<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.910> like<00:03:30.030> that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
recover some and you know just like that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.150
