that's nice yeah an ice-cream query -
foz<00:01:14.409> we<00:01:14.560> got<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.859> is<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.100> it's<00:01:15.250> all<00:01:15.429> in<00:01:15.539> unless

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
foz we got this is it it's all in unless

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.690 
foz we got this is it it's all in unless
unless<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.829> are<00:01:17.979> moves<00:01:18.189> all<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:18.520> first

maybe they don't want a coin flip in
those<00:01:27.909> two<00:01:28.060> fours<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.539> coin<00:01:28.840> flip<00:01:29.140> we'll

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
those two fours is a coin flip we'll

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.370 
those two fours is a coin flip we'll
have<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.740> see<00:01:30.630> surely<00:01:31.630> can't<00:01:31.959> afford<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
have to see surely can't afford the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.749 
have to see surely can't afford the
fault<00:01:32.619> it<00:01:32.829> moves<00:01:33.069> it<00:01:33.219> all<00:01:33.399> in

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
fault it moves it all in

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.600 
fault it moves it all in
he<00:01:33.819> knows<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.360> coin<00:01:34.569> flip<00:01:34.719> situation<00:01:35.610> does

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
he knows it's a coin flip situation does

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.980 
he knows it's a coin flip situation does
he<00:01:36.729> want<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:36.969> confidence<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.509> does<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.810> how

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
he want a confidence it does you how

he want a confidence it does you how
colder<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:39.000> think<00:01:40.000> yetis<00:01:40.270> prepared<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.780> be

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
colder I think yetis prepared to be

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.350 
colder I think yetis prepared to be
patient<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.159> he<00:01:42.340> gonna<00:01:42.490> do<00:01:42.729> here<00:01:43.000> he's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
patient what is he gonna do here he's

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.609 
patient what is he gonna do here he's
got<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.599> move<00:01:43.689> all<00:01:43.869> in<00:01:43.899> off<00:01:44.110> right<00:01:44.319> away<00:01:44.470> it's

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
got to move all in off right away it's

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.130 
got to move all in off right away it's
very<00:01:44.649> simple<00:01:45.159> to<00:01:45.340> pass<00:01:45.579> what<00:01:46.569> will<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.899> do

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
very simple to pass what will you do

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.080 
very simple to pass what will you do
what's<00:01:47.829> in<00:01:48.039> his<00:01:48.189> head<00:01:48.399> I<00:01:48.579> don't<00:01:48.759> know<00:01:48.819> but<00:01:49.000> the
