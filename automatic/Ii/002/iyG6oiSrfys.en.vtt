the<00:01:20.910> diet<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.020> pretty<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.500> consists

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the diet you know pretty much consists

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of only omega-6 which is not good so you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
of only omega-6 which is not good so you
want<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.120> of<00:01:27.300> balance<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.900> three<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
want that kind of balance at three to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.300 
want that kind of balance at three to
one<00:01:28.320> ratio<00:01:28.550> going<00:01:29.550> on<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.000> um<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.830> oils<00:01:32.190> that

coconut oil war virgin coconut oil

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.170 
coconut oil war virgin coconut oil
because<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.970> same<00:01:40.580> oil<00:01:41.580> and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.630 

let's<00:01:45.180> give<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.570> olive<00:01:45.990> oil<00:01:46.400> so<00:01:47.400> that's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
let's give them like olive oil so that's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
let's give them like olive oil so that's
how<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.270> perfect<00:01:48.540> balance<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
how you get that perfect balance and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.460 
how you get that perfect balance and
I've<00:01:49.860> done<00:01:50.130> research<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.470> all

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I've done research on this and all

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
I've done research on this and all
people<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:52.980> saying<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:54.740> they<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:56.360> energy

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
people are saying that they get energy

body question one the cooler thing that
did<00:02:14.190> increase<00:02:14.520> their<00:02:14.850> energy<00:02:16.190> what<00:02:17.190> I've<00:02:17.310> read

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
did increase their energy what I've read

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.220 
did increase their energy what I've read
about<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.420> actually<00:02:18.600> boosts<00:02:19.170> your

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
guys this long basically okay it's

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.070 
guys this long basically okay it's
basically<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.190> only<00:02:38.340> oil<00:02:38.959> if<00:02:39.959> I

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
basically this this is the only oil if I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.800 
basically this this is the only oil if I
understand<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.560> correctly<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:41.630> once<00:02:42.630> you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
understand it correctly that once you

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
understand it correctly that once you
ingested<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.620> will<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:44.010> store<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.670> your<00:02:44.700> body

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
ingested it will not store in your body

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.479 
ingested it will not store in your body
as<00:02:45.360> fat<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.320> automatically<00:02:46.890> converts<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
as fat it automatically converts the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.510 
as fat it automatically converts the
energy<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.420> you're<00:02:48.570> not<00:02:48.660> storing<00:02:48.989> fat<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:50.280> are

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
energy so you're not storing fat you are

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.310 
energy so you're not storing fat you are
basically<00:02:50.970> taking<00:02:51.510> an<00:02:51.570> energy<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.140> you're

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
basically taking an energy that you're

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600 
basically taking an energy that you're
actually<00:02:52.470> going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.860> use<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
actually going to use the of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.840 
actually going to use the of
storage<00:02:54.090> cell<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:54.930> body<00:02:55.550> may<00:02:56.550> also<00:02:56.730> clean
