I<00:06:27.750> think<00:06:28.750> you<00:06:28.840> know<00:06:28.960> what<00:06:29.080> I<00:06:29.110> mean<00:06:30.270> that's<00:06:31.270> why

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
I think you know what I mean that's why

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.660 
I think you know what I mean that's why
I<00:06:31.480> think<00:06:31.600> that<00:06:31.900> nip<00:06:32.110> is<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.380> Asian<00:06:32.860> n-word

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
I think that nip is the Asian n-word

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.880 
I think that nip is the Asian n-word
you<00:06:34.480> know<00:06:34.570> because<00:06:34.810> white<00:06:35.050> people<00:06:35.320> use<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.590> we

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
you know because white people use it we

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.590 
you know because white people use it we
get<00:06:36.040> ticked<00:06:36.250> off<00:06:36.400> but<00:06:36.760> I<00:06:36.820> think<00:06:37.060> if<00:06:37.150> we<00:06:37.300> used<00:06:37.450> it

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
get ticked off but I think if we used it

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.230 
get ticked off but I think if we used it
more<00:06:37.900> between<00:06:38.200> each<00:06:38.980> other<00:06:39.310> as<00:06:39.580> a<00:06:39.610> race<00:06:39.910> for

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
more between each other as a race for

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.500 
more between each other as a race for
bonding<00:06:40.770> that<00:06:41.770> could<00:06:41.890> be<00:06:41.980> good

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
bonding that could be good

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:55.290
