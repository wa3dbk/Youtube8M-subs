game and after brink I just wasn't
really<00:00:18.420> looking<00:00:18.539> forward<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.930> playing<00:00:19.080> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
really looking forward to playing this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650 
really looking forward to playing this
and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.760> thought<00:00:20.850> would<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.119> even<00:00:21.630> worse

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and I just thought would be even worse

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.009 
and I just thought would be even worse
and<00:00:22.050> brink<00:00:22.350> simply<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.660> I've<00:00:24.660> always

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and brink simply because I've always

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.790 
and brink simply because I've always
imagined<00:00:26.060> well<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.330> used<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> play<00:00:28.140> spyro<00:00:28.529> back

but i wasn't expecting much on this game
and<00:00:37.940> first<00:00:38.940> things<00:00:39.360> first<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.770> main

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and first things first and the main

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.630 
and first things first and the main
thing<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.000> review<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:43.219> that<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.370> game

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
thing of this review is that this game

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
thing of this review is that this game
is<00:00:44.850> better<00:00:45.210> than<00:00:45.450> drink<00:00:45.809> i<00:00:46.050> must<00:00:46.500> admit<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
is better than drink i must admit that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.760 
is better than drink i must admit that
but<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> still<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:49.079> much<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.649> than

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
but it is still not much better than

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.350

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
and yeah it's a pretty weird story

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.950 
and yeah it's a pretty weird story
basically<00:02:06.280> some<00:02:07.240> reason<00:02:07.509> you've<00:02:07.659> been<00:02:07.810> like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
basically some reason you've been like

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.710 
basically some reason you've been like
frozen<00:02:08.319> four<00:02:08.679> years<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.340> they've<00:02:10.030> freed<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
frozen four years and they've freed you

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.559

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.559 
actually seen yet who wants to kill you
I<00:02:17.319> think<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.890> your<00:02:18.430> plan<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> cure<00:02:19.090> them<00:02:19.360> I

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
I think and your plan is to cure them I

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.900 
I think and your plan is to cure them I
don't<00:02:20.349> exactly<00:02:20.739> know<00:02:21.069> but<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.700> weird

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
don't exactly know but it's a weird

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.610 
don't exactly know but it's a weird
story<00:02:22.150> lion<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.660> didn't<00:02:22.959> understand<00:02:23.379> that

story lion I didn't understand that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.110 
story lion I didn't understand that
probably<00:02:24.010> because<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.519> really<00:02:24.819> up<00:02:24.970> to

given<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.630> game<00:03:16.750> back<00:03:16.989> because<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.889> game<00:03:18.069> is

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
given the game back because this game is

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.930 
given the game back because this game is
a<00:03:18.370> really<00:03:18.849> difficult<00:03:19.329> game<00:03:20.519> maybe<00:03:21.519> I'm<00:03:21.790> just

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
a really difficult game maybe I'm just

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
really bad at it I think that is the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.949 
really bad at it I think that is the
case<00:03:23.889> i'm<00:03:24.340> bad<00:03:24.819> at<00:03:24.970> pretty<00:03:25.209> much<00:03:25.269> every<00:03:25.780> game

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
case i'm bad at pretty much every game

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.140 
case i'm bad at pretty much every game
but<00:03:26.260> i<00:03:26.410> really<00:03:26.829> couldn't<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.160> sold<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.700> lot<00:03:27.970> of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
but i really couldn't have sold a lot of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.240 
but i really couldn't have sold a lot of
these<00:03:28.239> puzzles<00:03:28.630> i<00:03:28.810> love<00:03:29.500> them<00:03:29.650> i<00:03:29.799> had<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:30.010> use

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
these puzzles i love them i had to use

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.720 
these puzzles i love them i had to use
YouTube<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.500> sasa<00:03:32.500> how<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.889> solve<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.400> puzzles

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
YouTube to sasa how to solve the puzzles

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.830

so<00:03:33.970> if<00:03:34.690> hard<00:03:34.959> work<00:03:35.169> it's<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.709> difficult<00:03:36.370> game

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
so if hard work it's a difficult game

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.330 
so if hard work it's a difficult game
and<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:38.889> can<00:03:39.190> get<00:03:39.340> boring<00:03:39.519> very<00:03:39.910> quickly

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
and it can get boring very quickly

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.920 
and it can get boring very quickly
there's<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.370> lot<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.579> collectibles<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.359> stuff

get can take a little while to get used

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.479 
get can take a little while to get used
to<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.430> once<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.910> used<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.209> it's<00:03:52.359> pretty<00:03:52.660> easy

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
to but once you used to it's pretty easy

but yeah the graphics were good voice

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.809 
but yeah the graphics were good voice
acting<00:03:57.010> was<00:03:57.099> good<00:03:57.310> apart<00:03:57.609> from<00:03:57.730> the

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
acting was good apart from the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.229 
acting was good apart from the
lip-synching<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:59.709> gameplay<00:04:00.160> itself

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
lip-synching and the gameplay itself

lip-synching and the gameplay itself
fighting<00:04:01.239> mechanics<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.810> didn't<00:04:02.319> really<00:04:02.410> enjoy

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
fire on that which they're good but it's

boring mechanics so yeah there's not
much<00:04:22.419> else<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.750> say<00:04:22.840> really<00:04:23.820> I'm<00:04:24.820> not<00:04:25.120> very

good<00:04:25.360> reviewing<00:04:25.960> games<00:04:25.990> but<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.120> thinking

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
good reviewing games but if you thinking

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720 
good reviewing games but if you thinking
of<00:04:28.780> getting<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.139> game<00:04:29.380> for<00:04:29.710> whatever<00:04:30.280> reason

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
of getting this game for whatever reason

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.440 
of getting this game for whatever reason
I<00:04:31.480> wouldn't<00:04:32.380> recommend<00:04:32.590> buying<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.130> because

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
I wouldn't recommend buying it because

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.430 
I wouldn't recommend buying it because
even<00:04:34.450> though<00:04:34.540> I<00:04:34.570> didn't<00:04:34.870> complete<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.230> I

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
even though I didn't complete it I

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.840 
even though I didn't complete it I
reckon<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:35.980> did<00:04:36.190> complete<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.639> that<00:04:36.760> I'd

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
reckon if you did complete it that I'd

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.090 
reckon if you did complete it that I'd
be<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.000> only<00:04:37.330> time<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.690> played<00:04:38.020> it<00:04:38.230> so<00:04:38.530> if<00:04:38.980> you

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
be the only time you played it so if you

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.379 
be the only time you played it so if you
don't<00:04:39.430> want<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.700> waste<00:04:39.820> your<00:04:39.910> money<00:04:40.090> I

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
don't want to waste your money I

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.720 
don't want to waste your money I
wouldn't<00:04:40.690> buy<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.870> renting<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.680> maybe<00:04:42.520> if

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
wouldn't buy it renting it maybe if

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.950 
wouldn't buy it renting it maybe if
you're<00:04:42.880> if<00:04:43.060> you're<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.210> big<00:04:43.330> fan<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.540> Spyro

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
played this game if you've just been

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.690 
played this game if you've just been
wondering<00:04:56.050> about<00:04:56.169> renting<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.770> or<00:04:56.919> get<00:04:57.460> in<00:04:57.580> it

wondering about renting it or get in it

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.670 
wondering about renting it or get in it
because<00:04:57.820> it<00:04:58.060> looks<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.570> good<00:04:59.020> change<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.650> pace

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
because it looks a good change of pace
