00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
is there was a limit to the amount of

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.080 
is there was a limit to the amount of
shit<00:05:58.710> he<00:05:58.890> allowed<00:05:59.070> himself<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.520> take<00:05:59.730> from<00:05:59.940> her

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
shit he allowed himself to take from her

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.850 
shit he allowed himself to take from her

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
annoying how much she allows himself to

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.100 
annoying how much she allows himself to
be<00:06:05.220> physically<00:06:05.760> abused<00:06:06.090> despite<00:06:06.540> supposedly

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.670 
situations
maybe<00:06:10.270> some<00:06:10.509> people<00:06:10.750> find<00:06:10.900> this<00:06:11.050> truck<00:06:11.289> buddy

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
I personally don't and I think I side

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.450 
I personally don't and I think I side
more<00:06:14.080> with<00:06:14.139> taiga<00:06:14.500> in<00:06:14.740> her<00:06:14.889> promotion<00:06:15.370> of

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
more with taiga in her promotion of

more with taiga in her promotion of
gender<00:06:15.610> equality<00:06:15.759> I<00:06:19.560> his<00:06:20.560> relationship<00:06:21.129> with

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
gender equality I his relationship with

gender equality I his relationship with
taiga<00:06:21.610> is<00:06:21.759> also<00:06:22.060> far<00:06:22.389> more<00:06:22.419> watchable<00:06:22.990> to<00:06:23.110> me

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
taiga is also far more watchable to me

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.110 
taiga is also far more watchable to me
because<00:06:23.500> taiga<00:06:23.889> never<00:06:24.219> comes<00:06:24.520> across<00:06:24.759> as<00:06:25.060> a

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
because taiga never comes across as a

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.520 
because taiga never comes across as a
complete<00:06:25.930> bitch

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
complete bitch

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.980 
complete bitch

she<00:06:34.210> becomes<00:06:34.479> significantly<00:06:35.110> more<00:06:35.409> likable

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
she becomes significantly more likable

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.070 
she becomes significantly more likable
not<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:36.669> much<00:06:36.819> because<00:06:37.000> she<00:06:37.300> changes<00:06:37.870> although

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
not so much because she changes although

she does a little bit of that but

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.399 
she does a little bit of that but

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.249 
important to me the point is the show
allowed<00:07:30.759> me<00:07:30.969> to<00:07:31.000> derive<00:07:31.360> meaning<00:07:31.629> from<00:07:31.750> it<00:07:32.050> and

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:32.259 
allowed me to derive meaning from it and

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.610 
allowed me to derive meaning from it and
