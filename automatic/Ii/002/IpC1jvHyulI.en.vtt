 this means 55002 same uu 55 this was the greatest coward 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:12.459
 zoomed decoder 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.589
 make objects 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.589
 from here we move we receive 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.460
 we can already 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 around 100 35 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.040
 these minimum 125 you buy the long TV times one hundred and thirty-five 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.230
 this is the maximum network 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 whether to start from this 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.120
 construction cost 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.870
 then we move on 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 we still sell we are still a 2 50 win 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 so this one 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 insomma.it my grandfather on the tivo train 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.870
 now I know it big 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.660
 see himym 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.260
 really me 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.740
 if instead, for example, now look, I try to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 deactivate the stabilizer 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.480
 manage the movements that make the hands 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.370
 rightly zoom in 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.880
 suffer 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.350
 good morning 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.170
 image movement 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 now the goal 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 look at how still it is because it really confesses the movements of the hand 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 then we repeat English 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 200 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.940
 stabilizer
