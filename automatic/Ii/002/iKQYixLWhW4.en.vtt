00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.230
 then hello everyone welcome to mine 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.369
 new passion channel fishing as you see 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.840
 here in front is my equipment 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.660
 because I opened this open channel 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.150
 very little since very little the other 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.690
 yesterday because I said to myself is going to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.650
 arrive 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.820
 summer is going to summer because 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.860
 summer, in short, spring periods 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.589
 however quite hot because not 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.699
 open a channel where I can do it 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.559
 see in short what I use for 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.010
 fishing then this channel will treat 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.629
 especially saltwater fishing in 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.269
 fresh water a little less maybe a little 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.289
 trout fishing then here is mine 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.219
 equipment 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.530
 let's start from the left then from a 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.710
 son of the lan camer who is among the most 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.550
 among the poorest we say I need it 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.469
 only for fishing 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.420
 wanting to do the wanting to have fun and a 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.610
 valentino maybe a little depth a 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.440
 this holds up to twenty books and therefore 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:18.770
 it's pretty tough you didn't see it 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:21.260
 then then we have two release leads 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.660
 100 gram quick 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.400
 these we can easily use alloy 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.090
 trolling as you can see but not 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.420
 quick release 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.170
 and here we can use them then in the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.020
 fishing in trolling the ca in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.030
 in the event that the artificial does not drop 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.030
 at the depth you want 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:55.240
 then there is a metal gb of the Sicilian maul x1 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.240
 of 40 grams if I show it 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 here it is a chip for spinning the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.540
 you see is the natural coloring like the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.290
 clear sky then a correct one 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.020
 enough still enough 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.440
 large and mackerel processing of 40 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.270
 grams then launches enough 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.720
 quite far 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:29.270
 then we have a 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.140
 gig jack a byte then an artificial 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.570
 long enough it is 12 cm you can use 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.870
 both for trolling however it is 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.970
 also recommended for spinning because 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.250
 precisely at breakfast the coloring 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.790
 of a mackerel you see upstream hours ok 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.840
 you see is the coloring of the mackerel has 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:59.600
 the scoop big enough to correct 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:10.070
 but even then there is a simple teaspoon 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:11.780
 undulating for mackerel and the two gl 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.620
 which are very important in fishing 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.180
 of fishing because there are snacks that 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.270
 they are of the spinning that hold up to 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.830
 60 books and very resistant and snacks 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.360
 for trolling that hold up to 35 kg e 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.790
 therefore very fundamental indeed then three 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.330
 more or less 50 grams for fishing from 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.310
 shore possibly and then there are gods 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.030
 which of makers that are tubes in 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.560
 plastic separating the terminal 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.260
 from the beginning of the son and then there are 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.510
 of starch size 8 which are excellent 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.820
 sees trigger Korean American arrive 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.680
 so if my equipment is there 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.970
 liked and let me become a 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.120
 comment subscribe to my channel 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.530
 suggeritemi or something to do 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.209
 own videos in upcoming videos 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 will be captured video and 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.600
 possibly even beautiful catches and 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.440
 ends here 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.440
