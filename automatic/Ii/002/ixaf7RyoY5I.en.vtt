00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello youth today new release and 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 today we will have 2 very cool 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.780
 characters that relate to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.910
 to the criminal world and 1 you know for sure 2 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.420
 probably the name of the news but nonetheless 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.670
 I repeat this is 25 subject related to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.390
 crime we wondered who of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.230
 them cooler 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.789
 we use our system our computer 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 simulated a special factory on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.620
 who will appear these two fighters 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 criminal front and find out who is cooler 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.890
 you ask who are you will learn 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.890
 it right after the screensaver 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 Well Well dear friends, it's time to 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.800
 get acquainted with the characters of today 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 the series first is boris razor 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.949
 boris razor he is fictional 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.140
 character we meet 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.390
 movie big score and if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.360
 Boris former employee KGB 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 he went through special training therefore 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.619
 let's immediately announce its parameters 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.990
 first, we immediately add plus 20 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.390
 percent to his health because u 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.720
 his special training in his second 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 image of virtually unkillable thousands 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 thugs third he uses a revolver 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.900
 heavy revolver with hefty bullets 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 but always with him cold weapons 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.520
 boris this connection deservedly fear in 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.720
 city â€‹â€‹of london therefore to its parameters 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.509
 we add plus 20 percent to damage and 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:57.180
 plus 5 percent accuracy from weakness 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.399
 Boris I do not even know well, perhaps bad 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.710
 close and then Boris prosperity and therefore 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.840
 I also think you should look 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.830
 small so these excerpts from the movie where 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.370
 it 's about boris think there there 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 quite clearly tell and u bitch 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 what do you know about this fight as ex 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
 employees either completed 5 trainings 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.480
 his secret agent will be impossible 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.489
 find some strange person here 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.190
 wants to sell us a diamond at 84 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.269
 whence he does not know it is difficult to say at 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.269
 he has a heavy russian accent 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.340
 heaviness 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.230
 it is good gravity it is reliable 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.570
 even if you don't shoot like that always 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.840
 can cut shirts by dropping boris razor 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.060
 with tanya borisa fuck you get a sharp as 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.680
 a sickle blow to the balls and hard as a blow 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.750
 hammer sos and the living Soviet coat of arms 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.910
 They say this bastard is generally impossible 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.700
 kill the second character of today 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.730
 our series is agent 47 and and i 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.290
 I think everyone or almost everyone knows who 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.030
 it is but if not aware i am short 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:20.000
 I will remind 147 this is the type of clone which 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.730
 created from 12 of the coolest advanced 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.280
 kill agent owns all types of weapons 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.550
 so we add a plus to its accuracy 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.100
 10 percent kuron broadcast 15 because 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.110
 he is good with gunshot and cold 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.810
 weapons 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.450
 besides, he is stylish his chic 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.130
 tie and suit and can't say so 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.110
 leave we can not leave without 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.000
 attention but bad news we 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.080
 add minus 10 percent stealth 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.730
 movement because 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.280
 and the barcode on his head is like 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.120
 not cool all the same 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.800
 subtract rather increases visibility 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.940
 the crowd is therefore right here 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.600
 adjust agent 47 is silent like 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.830
 all cool people so in this regard we 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.549
 add to it more health 10 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.950
 percent so this way we 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.870
 In principle, the main parameters of these 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.950
 characters voiced now colleague 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.510
 will hammer into our system all this data and 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.680
 we are here to arrange a battle between them closely 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.680
 who is still a hook 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.960
 composition nifiga 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.960
 at the same time 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.259
 I would like to say a few words about how 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.909
 conducted our research because 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:03.939
 have you seen i die kent and boris but 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:07.930
 fundamentally we spent a lot of battles 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:10.139
 in order to really understand these things 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.050
 really bring some statistics 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:17.770
 it turned out that 70 percent of the battles 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.410
 Agent 47 won and only in 30 no 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.410
 sorry 20 percent of the cases won 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.810
 boris and in 10 percent of cases they have 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:29.650
 there was a draw but basically seven 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.729
 percent it says exactly what 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.789
 agent 47 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.460
 is the winner in our today's 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:39.070
 the battle though to borisu we also express something with 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.139
 interest spect for its quality and honestly 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.789
 speaking with an assistant rooted it for 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.229
 Boris but nevertheless the program with us 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:49.180
 objective 147 today turned out to be stronger 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.430
 I hope this release was they very 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.849
 long and we more or less say so 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.110
 were able to tell about these two characters 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.810
 dear friends i would like to end 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.590
 remind you that we have a group and 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.960
 that we are just an assistant very much 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.970
 strongly rejoice when someone in it 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.789
 someone to sign on it and I 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.620
 invite you to subscribe to it 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.010
 more is not so difficult to spend 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.139
 a couple of clicks and you already had Thais 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.449

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.990
 release which I hope will be dedicated 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.110
 the construction of our huge rollers all 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.110
 until
