without<00:00:46.390> too<00:00:46.780> much<00:00:46.960> projection<00:00:47.649> now<00:00:48.130> this

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
without too much projection now this

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.220 
without too much projection now this
might<00:00:48.700> sound<00:00:48.910> like<00:00:49.030> an<00:00:49.210> unusual<00:00:49.450> thing<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.960> say

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
might sound like an unusual thing to say

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.170 
might sound like an unusual thing to say
considering<00:00:51.130> most<00:00:51.370> modern<00:00:51.880> sax

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
considering most modern sax

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.090 
considering most modern sax
manufacturers<00:00:52.960> strive<00:00:53.410> to<00:00:53.710> make<00:00:53.829> a<00:00:53.860> sound

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
manufacturers strive to make a sound

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.370 
manufacturers strive to make a sound
with<00:00:54.280> plenty<00:00:54.760> of<00:00:54.790> projection<00:00:55.360> however<00:00:56.140> that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
with plenty of projection however that

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.170 
with plenty of projection however that
wasn't<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.800> objective<00:00:57.309> here<00:00:57.700> if<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.149> think

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
wasn't the objective here if you think

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.990 
wasn't the objective here if you think
about<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.780> sax<00:00:59.079> is<00:00:59.320> back<00:00:59.649> in<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.890> 20s<00:01:00.340> they

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
about it sax is back in the 20s they

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.280 
about it sax is back in the 20s they
didn't<00:01:01.270> have<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.450> compete<00:01:01.809> with<00:01:01.870> loud

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
didn't have to compete with loud

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.109 
didn't have to compete with loud
instruments<00:01:02.890> like<00:01:03.040> electric<00:01:03.520> guitars<00:01:03.879> for

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
instruments like electric guitars for

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.210 
instruments like electric guitars for
example<00:01:04.660> so<00:01:05.140> there<00:01:05.259> wasn't<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.590> need<00:01:05.830> to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
example so there wasn't the need to

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.029 
example so there wasn't the need to
produce<00:01:06.399> a<00:01:06.640> high<00:01:06.850> octane<00:01:07.240> kind<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.750> sound<00:01:08.039> so

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
produce a high octane kind of sound so

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.580 
produce a high octane kind of sound so
one<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.640> first<00:01:09.880> things<00:01:10.119> they<00:01:10.330> did<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.750> meet

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
one of the first things they did to meet

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.499 
one of the first things they did to meet
this<00:01:11.710> objective<00:01:11.890> was<00:01:12.700> they've<00:01:13.210> got<00:01:13.390> this

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
this objective was they've got this

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.020 
this objective was they've got this
really<00:01:13.810> thick<00:01:14.200> pearl<00:01:14.680> lacquer<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.610> I'm<00:01:15.729> told

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
really thick pearl lacquer and I'm told

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.969 
really thick pearl lacquer and I'm told
that<00:01:16.150> it's<00:01:16.270> got<00:01:16.450> actual<00:01:16.930> real<00:01:17.170> pearl<00:01:17.500> crushed

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
that it's got actual real pearl crushed

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.890 
that it's got actual real pearl crushed
into<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.400> lacquer<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.540> add<00:01:19.690> this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
into the lacquer and to add this

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.380 
into the lacquer and to add this
thickness<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.740> this<00:01:21.490> really<00:01:21.820> helps<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.210> add

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
thickness to it this really helps to add

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.020 
thickness to it this really helps to add
warmth<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.530> sound<00:01:23.740> you'll<00:01:24.520> notice<00:01:24.880> that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
warmth to the sound you'll notice that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.570 
warmth to the sound you'll notice that
there's<00:01:25.210> no<00:01:25.360> metal<00:01:26.170> pad<00:01:26.680> reflectors<00:01:27.250> on<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
there's no metal pad reflectors on the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700 
there's no metal pad reflectors on the
pad<00:01:27.790> that's<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.210> pure<00:01:28.510> white<00:01:28.869> leather<00:01:29.200> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
pad that's just pure white leather and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.200 
pad that's just pure white leather and
this<00:01:29.830> helps<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.130> take<00:01:30.220> all<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.640> sort<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.880> highs

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
this helps to take all the sort of highs

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
this helps to take all the sort of highs
out<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.750> sound<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.590> emphasizes<00:01:33.250> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
out of the sound just emphasizes the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.000 
out of the sound just emphasizes the
lows<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:33.610> mids<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.180> little<00:01:34.420> bit<00:01:34.540> more<00:01:35.010> there's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
lows and mids a little bit more there's

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.620 
lows and mids a little bit more there's
also<00:01:36.189> a<00:01:36.310> specially-designed

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
also a specially-designed

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.350 
also a specially-designed
crook<00:01:38.020> based<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.189> their<00:01:39.430> model<00:01:39.820> 22

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
crook based on that of their model 22

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.330 
crook based on that of their model 22
which<00:01:40.990> has<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> special<00:01:41.740> shape<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.130> allows

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
which has a special shape that allows

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.820 
which has a special shape that allows
this<00:01:42.580> warmth<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.150> presence<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.780> sound<00:01:44.080> to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
this warmth and presence of sound to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.399 
this warmth and presence of sound to
come<00:01:45.040> through<00:01:45.720> beyond<00:01:46.720> this<00:01:46.869> let's<00:01:47.080> look<00:01:47.170> at

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
come through beyond this let's look at

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.560 
come through beyond this let's look at
some<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.830> ergonomic<00:01:48.790> side<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
some of the ergonomic side of the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.080 
some of the ergonomic side of the
saxophone<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.590> immediately<00:01:51.430> upon<00:01:51.729> looking<00:01:51.909> at

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
saxophone so immediately upon looking at

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.690
