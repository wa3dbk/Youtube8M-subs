thing<00:06:54.030> that<00:06:54.060> I<00:06:54.210> only<00:06:54.360> the<00:06:54.509> kind<00:06:54.810> of<00:06:54.900> just

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
thing that I only the kind of just

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.770 
thing that I only the kind of just
bothered<00:06:55.409> me<00:06:55.439> was<00:06:56.069> that<00:06:56.129> yeah<00:06:57.090> it's<00:06:57.389> a<00:06:57.539> more

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
bothered me was that yeah it's a more

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.170 
bothered me was that yeah it's a more
superhero<00:06:58.409> movie<00:06:58.770> it's<00:06:58.949> a<00:06:59.039> Marvel<00:06:59.430> it's<00:06:59.610> owned

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
superhero movie it's a Marvel it's owned

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.899 
superhero movie it's a Marvel it's owned
by<00:07:00.270> disney<00:07:00.419> now<00:07:00.810> of<00:07:01.080> course<00:07:01.439> but<00:07:02.250> what<00:07:02.699> just

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
by disney now of course but what just

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.309 
by disney now of course but what just
kind<00:07:03.060> of<00:07:03.120> bothered<00:07:03.539> me<00:07:03.599> was<00:07:03.840> that<00:07:03.900> when<00:07:04.199> the

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
kind of bothered me was that when the

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.209 
kind of bothered me was that when the
alien<00:07:05.120> invasion<00:07:06.120> was<00:07:06.449> happening<00:07:07.009> you<00:07:08.009> didn't

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
alien invasion was happening you didn't

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.490 
alien invasion was happening you didn't
really<00:07:08.460> see<00:07:08.699> anyone<00:07:09.000> really<00:07:09.449> get<00:07:09.900> killed<00:07:10.199> and

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
really see anyone really get killed and

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.499 
really see anyone really get killed and
I<00:07:10.860> guess<00:07:11.069> that's<00:07:11.279> to<00:07:11.430> keep<00:07:11.639> the<00:07:11.849> rating<00:07:12.240> down

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
I guess that's to keep the rating down

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.659 
I guess that's to keep the rating down
for<00:07:12.930> the<00:07:13.590> little<00:07:13.830> kids<00:07:13.860> to<00:07:14.189> be<00:07:14.279> able<00:07:14.310> to<00:07:14.490> watch

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
for the little kids to be able to watch
