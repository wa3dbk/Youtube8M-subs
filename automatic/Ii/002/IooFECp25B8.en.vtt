video<00:02:09.630> game<00:02:09.869> crash<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.910> some<00:02:12.300> Japanese

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
video game crash and so some Japanese

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.390 
video game crash and so some Japanese
were<00:02:12.900> coming<00:02:13.170> into<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.350> company<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.130> my<00:02:14.220> boss

American<00:02:17.280> could<00:02:17.459> ever<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.940> learn

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
American could ever really learn

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.210 
American could ever really learn
Japanese<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.319> would<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.530> impossible<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
Japanese that it would be impossible and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.210 
Japanese that it would be impossible and
I<00:02:20.310> kind<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.730> took<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.150> as<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> challenge<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
I kind of took that as a challenge and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
I kind of took that as a challenge and
when<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> left<00:02:23.670> Atari<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.720> thought<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.530> know

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
when I left Atari I thought you know

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.559 
when I left Atari I thought you know
wouldn't<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.100> be<00:02:26.250> fun<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.940> Japan<00:02:27.330> and

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
wouldn't it be fun to go to Japan and

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.059 
wouldn't it be fun to go to Japan and
really<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.410> possible<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.890> ever

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
really see if it's possible to ever

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.070 
really see if it's possible to ever
understand<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.180> culture<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.750> learn<00:02:30.900> that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
understand that culture and learn that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.260 
understand that culture and learn that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.520 
people who spoke spoke English and it
was<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.739> hard<00:03:05.100> getting<00:03:05.489> around<00:03:05.790> town<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:07.350> was

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
was just hard getting around town it was

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
was just hard getting around town it was
hard<00:03:07.830> working<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.370> environment<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.090> made<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
hard working that environment I made a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.819 
hard working that environment I made a
game<00:03:09.840> where<00:03:10.530> my<00:03:11.370> designer<00:03:12.620> didn't<00:03:13.620> speak

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
game where my designer didn't speak

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.220 
game where my designer didn't speak
English<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.120> didn't<00:03:15.390> speak<00:03:15.570> Japanese<00:03:16.200> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
English and I didn't speak Japanese I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.199 
English and I didn't speak Japanese I
was<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.650> programmer<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.670> still<00:03:17.970> made<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
was the programmer and we still made a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.670 
was the programmer and we still made a
game<00:03:18.450> together<00:03:18.810> that's<00:03:19.560> tough<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.390> did<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
game together that's tough so we did the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.970 
game together that's tough so we did the
8-bit<00:03:23.610> conversion<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.540> epics<00:03:25.140> California

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
8-bit conversion of epics California

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.449 
8-bit conversion of epics California
games<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.660> my<00:03:28.049> designer<00:03:28.560> would<00:03:28.890> come<00:03:29.160> and

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
games and so my designer would come and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.970 
games and so my designer would come and
he'd<00:03:29.640> studied<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.540> PC<00:03:31.320> version<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.890> he'd

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
he'd studied the PC version and he'd

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.650 
he'd studied the PC version and he'd
bring<00:03:32.130> me<00:03:32.220> all<00:03:32.370> sorts<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.850> art<00:03:33.120> clips<00:03:33.450> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
bring me all sorts of art clips and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300 
bring me all sorts of art clips and
diagrams<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.320> he<00:03:34.440> kind<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.709> pointed<00:03:35.130> at<00:03:35.280> it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
diagrams and he kind of pointed at it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.699 
diagrams and he kind of pointed at it
and<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:36.000> look<00:03:36.180> at<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.359> version<00:03:36.750> running<00:03:37.140> on<00:03:37.320> PC

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and we look at the version running on PC

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.400 
and we look at the version running on PC
and<00:03:37.739> then<00:03:38.070> I'd<00:03:38.220> go<00:03:38.459> code<00:03:38.790> up<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:40.049> Master

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
and then I'd go code up the Master

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.709 
and then I'd go code up the Master
System<00:03:40.560> version
