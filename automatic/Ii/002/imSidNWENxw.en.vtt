00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 the new film by daniel espinosa den 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.630
 Maybe you as a director of safe 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.320
 know mad max tom hardy plays the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.079
 lead 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.060
 other actors are gary oldman 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.470
 vincent cassel and noomi rapace 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.829
 the film is based on the eponymous film 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 Roman by Tom Rob Smith of 2008 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.660
 appeared in paradise there is no murder 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.240
 with this quote begins in stalins 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.860
 soviet union of the 50s gambling 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.420
 thriller leo again on one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910
 war hero of the great patriotic 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.400
 war so the second world war 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.710
 works as an agent in the ministry for 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.600
 state security and chase enemies in the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 he comes up against his inner work 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 a mysterious series of murder the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
 due to communist ideology 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.079
 unthinkable in the Soviet Union 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.509
 it's hard to impossible something 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.790
 because all kill as 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.070
 accidents are to be stamped leo falls in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.200
 Unhappy is going to the ass of the world 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.840
 and starts with the help of his 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 Ms. Raissa and General leaves it on 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.280
 murder series on thinking a thing 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.320
 I would like to anticipate the considerable 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 because of the film, the fact is that way 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.280
 good as none of the important performers 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 come from russia in a movie of in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.159
 the soviet union of the 50s under 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.290
 Stalin plays that affects me and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.090
 authentic and gives the film a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.369
 wooden artifice i can do that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 reasons behind it understand though 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.360
 Train horses like Tom Hardy or Gary 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 Of course, oldman needs to use it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 but you would have at least a few 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.150
 Russian supporting actor engage 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.190
 maybe you can too 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.689
 a little more natural and genuine 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 the film is gripping and has the one 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.700
 or another exciting moment such as 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.590
 example as leo before the election is ob 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.770
 he based on a vote of confidence 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.659
 his wife raissa is to whistle 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.119
 Basically, the mood in the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.890
 interrogating the Soviet Union with denunciation 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.200
 and press the firing command 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.510
 but just the hunt for the killer is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.239
 quite briefly in contrast to 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.099
 other films about serial murders such as 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.769
 Example seven or the silence of the 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.080
 lambs lack child 44 at one 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.480
 Real killer-and-mouse game to the killer 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.120
 would have a pinch of sophistication in style 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.569
 a docter lecturer or john doe good 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.489
 done 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.010
 the story and the setting are very nice 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.750
 interesting but child 44 does it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.970
 just not the whole thing right 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.090
 to realize one realizes that attempts are made 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.280
 the complexity of the book in the 137th 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 minutes to fill 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.780
 but sometimes it would be better 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.269
 Certain things have been easy 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 fully to underline what one in which 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.900
 film in german dubbing 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.690
 fortunately he is spared 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.060
 English original completely exaggerated 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.890
 Russian accent in WÃ¶rth is wearing 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.599
 letting their minds to look you're up 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.250
 the exaggerated wobbly war 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.579
 see at the beginning of the film is the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.100
 are camera work well music ton cut 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.170
 also solid sting now but also 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.910
 not out of the crowd out of the movie 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.739
 one can however benefit from that 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.319
 Tom Hardy a usual solid 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.600
 performance gives gary oldman against 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.980
 would have deserved more screentime 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.380
 his character is seen easily 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.930
 little already pretty well the roman 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.250
 was with numerous prizes 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.069
 excellent and praised by critics 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.380
 the film adaptation, however, is rather mau 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.329
 The film gets from me only five 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.700
 of 10 mg b badge 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.910
 there are too many small strands of action 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.230
 the right thrill moments 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.150
 missing then but if so his 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.549
 Moments has the serial killer remains 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.709
 colorless and the film loses it 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.660
 to take too many elements out of the book 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.500
 want to put in the right place instead 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.290
 to shorten 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.209
 Nevertheless, I do not advise you off into 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.519
 to go to the cinema when the setting 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.040
 appeals to her former or tom 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.720
 hardy or gary oldman courage makes you 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.519
 calm yourself a picture of it 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.560
 the movie is not wrong but 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.269
 Really worth mentioning its weaknesses 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.250
 is also that the publication of the 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.690
 Films in Russia by the state 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.609
 authorities was stopped 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.489
 the minister of culture of russia Vladimir 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.830
 Medien ski commented on the film that 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.410
 he 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.540
 Iceland as the engine of orcs and cool 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.880
 is inhabited is represented others 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.430
 better movies with serial killers too 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.450
 do as mentioned 7 or above 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.030
 the silence of the Lambs 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.410
 Of course everyone knows but if you only 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.420
 a spectator is one of the two 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.190
 you have not seen movies yet you are watching 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.540

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.620
 review and you are at 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.230
