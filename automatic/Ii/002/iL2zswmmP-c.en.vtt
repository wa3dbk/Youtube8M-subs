feet<00:00:27.900> away<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:29.250> question<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.699> may<00:00:29.820> be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
feet away now a question you may be

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.269 
feet away now a question you may be
asking<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.480> why<00:00:30.840> would<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.080> need<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.590> transmit

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
asking is why would you need to transmit

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.780 
asking is why would you need to transmit
an<00:00:32.369> HD<00:00:32.700> signal<00:00:33.059> over<00:00:33.270> such<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> large<00:00:33.809> space

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
an HD signal over such a large space

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
an HD signal over such a large space
well<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> use<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> laptop<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.370> a

there<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.940> first<00:01:00.180> we're<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> open<00:01:01.109> up

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
there so first we're going to open up

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.410 
there so first we're going to open up
the<00:01:01.770> box<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.769> take<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> look<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the box here and take a look at this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.620 
the box here and take a look at this
unit<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> unit<00:01:12.420> comes

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
unit now as you can see the unit comes

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.700 
unit now as you can see the unit comes
with<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:13.080> parts

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
with two parts

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.840 
with two parts
you<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.640> receiver<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.850> your

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
you got your receiver and your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.990 
you got your receiver and your
transmitter<00:01:19.490> both<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.759> are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
transmitter both of these are

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
transmitter both of these are
approximately<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.320> they're<00:01:22.500> exactly<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
approximately well they're exactly the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
approximately well they're exactly the
same<00:01:23.159> size<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:25.110> might<00:01:25.409> make<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.770> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
same size that might make it a little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.289 
same size that might make it a little
bit<00:01:26.100> difficult<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.549> differentiate<00:01:27.000> between

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
bit difficult to differentiate between

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
bit difficult to differentiate between
the<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:33.380> right<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:35.119> on

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the two but as you can see right here on

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
the two but as you can see right here on
the<00:01:36.150> bottom<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.600> label<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.170> says<00:01:37.979> receiver

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the bottom and label here says receiver

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
the bottom and label here says receiver
and<00:01:38.850> transmitter<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.110> easy<00:01:40.290> enough<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and transmitter so that's easy enough to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
and transmitter so that's easy enough to
fix<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> watch<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
fix but you got to watch out if that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.219 
fix but you got to watch out if that
label<00:01:43.560> ever<00:01:43.710> comes<00:01:44.009> off<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.490> wear-and-tear

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
label ever comes off from wear-and-tear

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.170 
label ever comes off from wear-and-tear
and<00:01:47.000> also<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.210> got<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.570> nice<00:01:48.810> weighted

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
and also we got some nice weighted

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.300 
and also we got some nice weighted
holders<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.500> sender<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> receiver

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
holders for the sender for the receiver

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.179 
holders for the sender for the receiver
and<00:01:53.520> transmitter<00:01:55.939> these<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:58.189> very

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and transmitter these are actually very

00:01:59.189 --> 00:01:59.719 
and transmitter these are actually very
nice

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
nice

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
nice
they're<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:01.049> too<00:02:01.200> heavy<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.710> they

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
they're not not too heavy but they

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.999 
they're not not too heavy but they
they're<00:02:02.369> substantial<00:02:02.909> enough<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> you're

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
they're substantial enough that you're

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.170 
they're substantial enough that you're
you<00:02:05.009> don't<00:02:05.250> feel<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.759> gonna<00:02:05.850> fall<00:02:06.119> over

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
you don't feel like it's gonna fall over

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.280 
you don't feel like it's gonna fall over
on<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.899> middle<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> your

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.050 
include an HDMI cable we have to provide
it<00:02:41.060> yourself<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:43.610> got<00:02:43.730> your<00:02:43.940> little

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
it yourself and you got your little

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.270 
it yourself and you got your little
remote<00:02:44.390> here<00:02:47.470> obviously<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.799> don't<00:02:48.920> need<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
remote here obviously you don't need to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.970 
remote here obviously you don't need to
do<00:02:49.400> much<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:51.100> smaller<00:02:52.100> is<00:02:52.280> better<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
do much with it so smaller is better and

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.390 
do much with it so smaller is better and
in<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.310> we've<00:02:55.640> got

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.580 

right

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
right

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.720 
right
this<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.160> IR<00:03:02.640> extender<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.300> if<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.930> want

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
this is the IR extender so if you want

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.860 
this is the IR extender so if you want
to<00:03:05.730> use<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.269> remote<00:03:06.530> which<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> infrared<00:03:08.870> you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
to use this remote which is infrared you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.330 
to use this remote which is infrared you
can<00:03:10.019> actually<00:03:10.230> extend<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.160> you're

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
can actually extend it so that you're

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.190 
can actually extend it so that you're
not<00:03:11.459> having<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.450> point<00:03:12.750> your<00:03:13.379> remote<00:03:13.739> at<00:03:15.200> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
not having to point your remote at the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.229 
not having to point your remote at the
extender<00:03:16.650> itself<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.519> extender<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.120> be

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
extender itself so the extender can be

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.930 
extender itself so the extender can be
underneath<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> desk<00:03:19.080> or<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.650> can<00:03:19.830> be<00:03:19.980> hidden

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
underneath a desk or it can be hidden

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.080 
underneath a desk or it can be hidden
away<00:03:21.120> somewhere<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.170> have<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.349> site<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.769> mine<00:03:23.090> and

away somewhere I have a site of mine and
all<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.840> little<00:03:25.140> red<00:03:25.430> dongle

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
all you have is this little red dongle

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.960 
all you have is this little red dongle
sitting<00:03:27.299> that's<00:03:27.660> what<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.230> point<00:03:28.410> it

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
sitting that's what you have to point it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.699 
sitting that's what you have to point it
so<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.390> that's<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.379> comes<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709

so that's the that's what comes in the
box<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.299> we'll<00:03:33.299> demonstrate<00:03:33.930> how<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.470> whole

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
box and we'll demonstrate how the whole

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.100 
box and we'll demonstrate how the whole
system<00:03:34.829> works<00:03:35.540> okay<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.599> as<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.049> see

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
system works okay so as you can see

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.430 
system works okay so as you can see
we've<00:03:37.470> got<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.950> wireless<00:03:38.670> extender<00:03:39.450> setup

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
we've got the wireless extender setup

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.100 
we've got the wireless extender setup
here<00:03:40.829> connected<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.430> our<00:03:41.640> bench<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.150> system

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
here connected to our bench and system

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.640 
here connected to our bench and system
that<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.349> have<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:43.829> with<00:03:44.010> HDMI<00:03:45.530> got<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
that we have on here with HDMI got it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.830 
that we have on here with HDMI got it
hooked<00:03:46.739> up<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.610> computer<00:03:47.940> monitor<00:03:48.420> here

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
hooked up to the computer monitor here

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.210 
hooked up to the computer monitor here
on

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
on

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.009 
on
fortunately<00:03:50.940> with<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.239> particular<00:03:51.720> unit

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
fortunately with this particular unit

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.920 
fortunately with this particular unit
when<00:03:52.140> you're<00:03:52.260> using<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.950> PC<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.329> only<00:03:54.599> use

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
when you're using a PC it can only use

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.680 
when you're using a PC it can only use
4:3<00:03:55.500> resolution<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.730> it's<00:03:57.000> right<00:03:57.239> now<00:03:57.390> sitting

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
4:3 resolution so it's right now sitting

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.240 
4:3 resolution so it's right now sitting
at<00:03:57.900> 1280<00:03:58.890> by<00:03:59.069> 1024<00:03:59.540> as<00:04:00.540> opposed<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.250> 1080p

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
at 1280 by 1024 as opposed to 1080p

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.690 
at 1280 by 1024 as opposed to 1080p
which<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.480> native<00:04:04.290> resolution<00:04:04.319> for<00:04:05.040> HD

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
which is the native resolution for HD

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.900 
which is the native resolution for HD
devices<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.359> blu-ray<00:04:06.720> player<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.910> so

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
devices like a blu-ray player and so

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.430 
devices like a blu-ray player and so
we're<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.090> going<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.389> take<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> walk<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.170> show

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
we're just going to take a walk and show

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.680 
we're just going to take a walk and show
you<00:04:10.500> how<00:04:10.829> far<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.459> from<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:13.440> receiver<00:04:13.859> and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
you how far it is from the receiver and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.430 
you how far it is from the receiver and
then<00:04:15.690> we'll<00:04:15.810> have<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.959> little<00:04:16.079> demonstration

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
then we'll have a little demonstration

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.430 
then we'll have a little demonstration
for<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.789> quality<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.329> video<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:18.989> everything

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
for the quality of video and everything

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.600 
for the quality of video and everything
that<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.739> gets<00:04:19.919> transmitted<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:26.160> right<00:04:26.370> here

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that it gets transmitted so right here

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.950 
that it gets transmitted so right here
is<00:04:26.669> we've<00:04:26.820> got<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.060> set<00:04:27.270> up<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:29.810> I'm<00:04:30.810> gonna

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
is we've got the set up and I'm gonna

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.830 
is we've got the set up and I'm gonna
have<00:04:31.110> my<00:04:31.139> assistant<00:04:32.060> go<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.270> computer<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
have my assistant go on the computer and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:48.800 
have my assistant go on the computer and
show<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.740> what<00:04:35.639> this<00:04:35.789> thing<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:36.090> do

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.400 

so<00:04:49.810> as<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:50.020> can<00:04:50.140> see<00:04:50.320> we<00:04:50.500> got<00:04:50.620> full<00:04:50.980> HD<00:04:51.610> video

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
so as you can see we got full HD video

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.980 
so as you can see we got full HD video
audio<00:04:53.410> being<00:04:53.800> transmitted<00:04:54.370> wirelessly

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
audio being transmitted wirelessly

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.420 
audio being transmitted wirelessly
real-time<00:04:56.100> no<00:04:57.100> lag<00:04:59.160> actually<00:05:00.160> looks<00:05:00.370> really

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
real-time no lag actually looks really

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.610 
real-time no lag actually looks really
good<00:05:00.820> but<00:05:02.880> yeah<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:04.690> seems<00:05:04.960> like<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.200> really

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
good but yeah it seems like a really

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.550 
good but yeah it seems like a really
nice<00:05:06.070> unit<00:05:06.720> we<00:05:07.720> did<00:05:08.050> have<00:05:08.260> some<00:05:08.440> issues

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
nice unit we did have some issues

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.000 
nice unit we did have some issues
setting<00:05:09.040> it<00:05:09.160> up<00:05:09.250> with<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.580> resolution

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
setting it up with the resolution

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.750 
setting it up with the resolution
because<00:05:12.010> if<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:13.270> have<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.350> have<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> computer

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
because if you have the have a computer

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.430 
because if you have the have a computer
that<00:05:16.090> does<00:05:16.450> 1080p<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:19.150> will<00:05:19.480> have<00:05:20.140> some

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
that does 1080p it will have some

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.060 
that does 1080p it will have some
artifact<00:05:21.130> issues<00:05:21.550> when<00:05:22.120> you<00:05:22.560> try<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.590> have
