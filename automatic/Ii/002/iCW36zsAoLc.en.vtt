plastic surgery of the faces is pretty

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.270 
plastic surgery of the faces is pretty
simple<00:01:33.970> it's<00:01:34.570> really<00:01:34.660> comes<00:01:35.200> down<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.410> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
simple it's really comes down to the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.340 
simple it's really comes down to the
patient<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:36.910> what<00:01:37.390> their<00:01:37.720> hopes<00:01:38.110> and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
expectations are one of the things that

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480 
expectations are one of the things that
I<00:01:40.630> recognized<00:01:41.170> very<00:01:41.350> early<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:42.039> I<00:01:42.130> think<00:01:42.190> one

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
I recognized very early and I think one

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
what it is that the patient is in the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.020 
what it is that the patient is in the

recognized<00:04:38.070> was<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.490> Valerie<00:04:38.790> had<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.940> loss<00:04:39.210> of

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
recognized was the Valerie had a loss of

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.970 
recognized was the Valerie had a loss of
volume<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.810> middle<00:04:40.110> portion<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.710> her<00:04:40.800> face

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
volume in the middle portion of her face

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.220 
volume in the middle portion of her face
the<00:04:41.220> mid<00:04:41.370> face<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.850> that's<00:04:42.600> associated<00:04:42.900> with

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
the mid face and that's associated with

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.680 
the mid face and that's associated with
fat<00:04:43.500> loss<00:04:43.530> thinness<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.730> skin<00:04:45.060> she<00:04:45.510> also

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
fat loss thinness of the skin she also

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.370 
fat loss thinness of the skin she also
had<00:04:46.050> malposition<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:48.630> jaw<00:04:48.870> line<00:04:49.110> and

had malposition of the the jaw line and

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.410 
had malposition of the the jaw line and
that<00:04:49.800> creates<00:04:50.160> what's<00:04:50.340> called<00:04:50.400> jowls<00:04:50.850> she<00:04:51.210> in

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
that creates what's called jowls she in

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.000 
that creates what's called jowls she in
addition<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.350> portion<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.800> neck

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
addition to that and portion of the neck

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.220 
addition to that and portion of the neck
there<00:04:53.520> was<00:04:53.640> laxity<00:04:54.210> resulting<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:54.990> and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
there was laxity resulting in and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.160 
there was laxity resulting in and
sagging<00:04:55.800> appearance<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.730> neck<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.600> our

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
sagging appearance of the neck so our

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.730 
sagging appearance of the neck so our
plan<00:04:58.620> for<00:04:58.860> Valerie<00:04:59.190> was<00:04:59.400> basically<00:04:59.880> to

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
plan for Valerie was basically to

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.500 
plan for Valerie was basically to
restore<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.920> lost<00:05:02.400> volume<00:05:02.850> in<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.060> in<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
restore the lost volume in the in the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.510 
restore the lost volume in the in the
upper<00:05:03.720> portion<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.200> face<00:05:04.410> with<00:05:04.920> fat

upper portion of the face with fat
transfer<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:07.080> reposition<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.550> these

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
transfer and to reposition the these

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.840 
transfer and to reposition the these
tissues<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.050> were<00:05:10.140> their<00:05:10.380> sagging<00:05:10.770> using<00:05:11.760> a

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
tissues that were their sagging using a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.540 
tissues that were their sagging using a
mini<00:05:12.630> lift<00:05:12.840> procedure<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.530> by<00:05:14.040> performing

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
mini lift procedure and by performing

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.040 
mini lift procedure and by performing
mini<00:05:14.850> lift<00:05:15.060> precipitous<00:05:15.510> continue<00:05:15.960> with

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
mini lift precipitous continue with

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.870 
mini lift precipitous continue with
procedure<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.890> entire<00:05:17.250> face<00:05:17.669> was

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
procedure the entire face was

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.790 
procedure the entire face was
recontoured<00:05:18.600> in<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.780> more<00:05:18.960> vertical<00:05:19.230> position

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
recontoured in a more vertical position

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.050 
recontoured in a more vertical position
and<00:05:19.919> that's<00:05:20.070> exactly<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.700> opposite

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
and that's exactly the opposite

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.810 
and that's exactly the opposite
direction<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:22.050> gravity<00:05:22.710> has<00:05:22.740> caused<00:05:23.580> the

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
direction that gravity has caused the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.700 
direction that gravity has caused the
mountain<00:05:24.419> so<00:05:24.570> when<00:05:24.750> that<00:05:24.870> is<00:05:25.050> restored<00:05:25.530> into

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
mountain so when that is restored into

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.800 
mountain so when that is restored into
this<00:05:25.919> direction<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.760> face<00:05:26.970> looks<00:05:27.210> natural<00:05:27.720> it

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
this direction the face looks natural it

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.230 
this direction the face looks natural it
doesn't<00:05:27.960> look<00:05:28.110> bold<00:05:28.230> it<00:05:28.620> doesn't<00:05:28.860> look
