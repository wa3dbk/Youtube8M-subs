happens I've got a little model here

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
happens I've got a little model here
this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> disk<00:00:41.399> which<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.700> soft<00:00:42.270> tissue

this is the disk which is soft tissue
and<00:00:42.780> these<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> nerve<00:00:43.559> roots<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and these are the nerve roots as it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
and these are the nerve roots as it
comes<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.789> among<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.239> around<00:00:46.020> the

athlete when you're talking about back
surgery<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.420> first<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.259> Larry<00:01:22.470> Bird<00:01:22.680> had

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
surgery well first of all Larry Bird had

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.700 
surgery well first of all Larry Bird had
a<00:01:22.890> fusion<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.720> probably<00:01:25.140> 20<00:01:25.530> years

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
a fusion and that was probably 20 years

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
a fusion and that was probably 20 years
ago<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.159> those<00:01:26.310> days<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> different

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
ago in those days it was a different

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.679 
ago in those days it was a different
procedure<00:01:27.860> this<00:01:28.860> appears<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.689> what's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
procedure this appears to be what's

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.890 
procedure this appears to be what's
known<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> disc<00:01:32.130> ectomy<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.360> taking<00:01:33.750> out

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
known as a disc ectomy just taking out

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
known as a disc ectomy just taking out
the<00:01:34.170> fragment<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.220> disc<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.729> been

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the fragment of disc that's been

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.160 
the fragment of disc that's been
ruptured<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.360> evolved<00:01:39.900> into<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
ruptured and that now is evolved into a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.850 
ruptured and that now is evolved into a
minimally<00:01:40.920> invasive<00:01:40.950> type<00:01:41.939> surgery<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
minimally invasive type surgery so it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
minimally invasive type surgery so it
can<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.189> done<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.000> small

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
can be done through a very small

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.560 
can be done through a very small
incision<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.880> lot<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.060> times<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.420> use<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
incision a lot of times we use a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.399

overall performance well it is the issue

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.290 
overall performance well it is the issue
here<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.080> there's<00:03:25.440> basically<00:03:26.160> although<00:03:27.090> it's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
here is there's basically although it's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.199 
here is there's basically although it's
six<00:03:28.140> surgeries<00:03:28.400> there's<00:03:29.400> two<00:03:29.730> different<00:03:29.910> body

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
six surgeries there's two different body

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.890 
six surgeries there's two different body
parts<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.930> with<00:03:31.770> regards<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.610> back<00:03:32.900> there

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
parts so with regards to the back there

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
parts so with regards to the back there
is<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> certain<00:03:34.650> amount<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:34.980> degeneration<00:03:35.670> that

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
is a certain amount of degeneration that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.440 
is a certain amount of degeneration that
will<00:03:36.120> occur<00:03:36.480> after<00:03:37.370> doing<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:38.790> performing

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
will occur after doing there performing

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.860 
will occur after doing there performing
the<00:03:39.540> surgery<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:41.400> cumulatively<00:03:42.360> with<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
the surgery so cumulatively with the

the surgery so cumulatively with the
back<00:03:43.110> in<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.680> future<00:03:43.860> yes<00:03:44.370> he<00:03:44.610> might<00:03:44.820> develop

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
back in the future yes he might develop

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.640 
back in the future yes he might develop
some<00:03:45.480> degenerative<00:03:45.900> disc<00:03:46.110> disease<00:03:46.170> and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
develop some chronic back pain there is

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.949 
develop some chronic back pain there is
a<00:03:49.440> seven<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.160> ten<00:03:50.400> percent<00:03:50.850> recurrence<00:03:51.690> rate

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
a seven to ten percent recurrence rate

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.430 
a seven to ten percent recurrence rate
where<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.590> disc<00:03:53.160> can<00:03:53.400> rupture<00:03:53.640> out<00:03:53.880> again<00:03:54.440> but

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
where the disc can rupture out again but

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.610 
where the disc can rupture out again but
I<00:03:55.500> think<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.790> near<00:03:57.060> term<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:58.380> back

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
I think for the near term the back

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.850 
I think for the near term the back
should<00:03:58.920> be<00:03:59.070> fine<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.730> arm<00:04:00.530> surgeries<00:04:01.530> it's

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
then he had another because it broke at

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.830 
then he had another because it broke at
the<00:04:08.310> end<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> plate<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.330> then<00:04:09.450> he<00:04:09.570> had<00:04:09.720> an
