for all varieties you can even use it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.190 
for all varieties you can even use it
before<00:02:01.259> caviar<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:01.979> you

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
before caviar if you

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.149 
before caviar if you
we<00:02:02.259> want<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:02.590> or<00:02:02.799> I've<00:02:02.920> hit<00:02:03.100> people<00:02:04.890> yeah<00:02:05.890> yeah

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
even a half-marathon in this time I said

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.290 
even a half-marathon in this time I said
we<00:02:08.830> use<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.250> left<00:02:09.459> last<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:09.940> know<00:02:10.090> five

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
we use it they left last you know five

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.699 
we use it they left last you know five
minutes<00:02:10.539> off<00:02:10.840> their<00:02:10.989> time<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.379> then<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:11.620> the

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
minutes off their time and then it's the

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.160 
minutes off their time and then it's the
best<00:02:11.890> thing<00:02:12.010> we've<00:02:12.069> ever<00:02:12.250> tried<00:02:12.930> nice<00:02:13.930> it's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
best thing we've ever tried nice it's

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.479 
best thing we've ever tried nice it's
pretty<00:02:14.200> impressive<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:14.950> pretty<00:02:15.220> impressive

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
pretty impressive it's pretty impressive

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.979 
pretty impressive it's pretty impressive
and<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:15.940> tell<00:02:16.150> us<00:02:16.239> some<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.569> about<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
and so tell us some of it about the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.259 
and so tell us some of it about the
ingredients<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.800> super<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:18.910> what<00:02:19.090> are<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
ingredients in super like what are the

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.229 
ingredients in super like what are the
core<00:02:19.569> components<00:02:19.860> okay<00:02:20.860> product<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:22.000> far

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
core components okay product up as far

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.059 
core components okay product up as far
as<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> stimulant<00:02:23.050> base<00:02:23.200> goes<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.680> nothing

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
as the stimulant base goes is nothing

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.680 
as the stimulant base goes is nothing
harmful<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.640> here<00:02:24.790> we're<00:02:24.970> talking<00:02:25.150> anything

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
harmful and here we're talking anything

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.720 
harmful and here we're talking anything
as<00:02:25.900> strong<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.230> capping<00:02:26.680> it's<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.459> other

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
as strong as capping it's the other

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.550 
as strong as capping it's the other
little<00:02:28.060> helpers<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> big<00:02:29.260> part<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
little helpers and a big part of a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.369 
little helpers and a big part of a
coffee<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.040> we're<00:02:30.130> talking<00:02:30.250> about<00:02:30.549> exactly

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
coffee and we're talking about exactly

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.320 
coffee and we're talking about exactly
are<00:02:32.379> usually<00:02:32.980> shoot<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:33.370> two<00:02:33.489> scoops<00:02:33.849> myself

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
are usually shoot for two scoops myself

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.670 
are usually shoot for two scoops myself
when<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.510> use<00:02:34.720> one<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.140> it's<00:02:35.260> kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
when I use one so it's kind of the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.550 
when I use one so it's kind of the
equivalent<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:36.099> having<00:02:36.220> two<00:02:36.459> cups<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.849> coffee

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
equivalent to having two cups of coffee

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.900 
equivalent to having two cups of coffee
but<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.739> other<00:02:38.920> ingredients<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.640> there<00:02:39.760> one

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
but the other ingredients in there one

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.280 
but the other ingredients in there one
key<00:02:40.150> one<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.329> mean<00:02:40.569> it's<00:02:40.720> called<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.989> super

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
key one I mean it's called the super

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.140 
key one I mean it's called the super
pump<00:02:41.500> mostly<00:02:42.040> because<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.400> are<00:02:42.519> indicating

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
pump mostly because they are indicating

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.600 
pump mostly because they are indicating
the<00:02:43.299> nitric<00:02:43.780> oxide<00:02:44.140> component<00:02:44.680> now<00:02:45.160> nitric

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
the nitric oxide component now nitric

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.640 
the nitric oxide component now nitric
oxide<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.120> usually<00:02:46.540> from<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> bunch<00:02:47.530> of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
oxide is usually from a bunch of

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.280 
oxide is usually from a bunch of
ingredients<00:02:47.819> arginine<00:02:48.819> basis<00:02:49.150> mostly<00:02:49.660> that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
ingredients arginine basis mostly that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.289 
ingredients arginine basis mostly that
are<00:02:50.440> precursors<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.130> making<00:02:51.579> nitric<00:02:51.849> oxide<00:02:52.180> in

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
are precursors to making nitric oxide in

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.300 
are precursors to making nitric oxide in
the<00:02:52.390> body<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.230> style<00:02:53.590> allows<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.130> do

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
the body what the style allows you to do

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.270 
the body what the style allows you to do
is<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:55.060> dilate<00:02:55.810> your<00:02:55.989> veins<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:57.010> what<00:02:57.160> this

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
is to dilate your veins and what this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.069 
is to dilate your veins and what this
means<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.579> by<00:02:57.760> making<00:02:57.970> them<00:02:58.239> bigger<00:02:58.540> there<00:02:58.959> is

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
means is by making them bigger there is

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.080 
means is by making them bigger there is
more<00:02:59.319> Bowl<00:02:59.799> ad<00:02:59.980> flow<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.579> we're<00:03:00.730> talking<00:03:00.880> about

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
more Bowl ad flow so we're talking about

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.720 
more Bowl ad flow so we're talking about
improve<00:03:01.510> circulation<00:03:01.720> yeah<00:03:02.739> but<00:03:03.280> not<00:03:03.400> only<00:03:03.549> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
improve circulation yeah but not only is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 
improve circulation yeah but not only is
improve<00:03:04.030> circulation<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.780> place<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.410> means

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
improve circulation in place that means

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.199 
improve circulation in place that means
you're<00:03:05.709> getting<00:03:05.799> more<00:03:06.040> nutrient<00:03:06.790> rich<00:03:07.150> blood

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
you're getting more nutrient rich blood

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.539 
you're getting more nutrient rich blood
to<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.139> working<00:03:08.440> muscles<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.370> can

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
to the working muscles so you can

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.610 
to the working muscles so you can
