basically the first guy her doing is a

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.210 
basically the first guy her doing is a
lot<00:00:41.570> was<00:00:41.720> towel<00:00:41.960> Farlow<00:00:42.350> back<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.770> 50s

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
lot was towel Farlow back in the 50s

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.090 
lot was towel Farlow back in the 50s
he's<00:00:43.340> won<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> first<00:00:44.829> electric<00:00:45.829> guitar

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
he's won the first electric guitar

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.770 
he's won the first electric guitar
players<00:00:46.309> do<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.550> lot<00:00:46.820> he's<00:00:47.390> bet<00:00:47.630> you're

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
players do a lot he's bet you're

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.080 
players do a lot he's bet you're
basically<00:00:49.570> fingering<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.660> note<00:00:50.840> here<00:00:51.079> and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
basically fingering a note here and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.270 
basically fingering a note here and
you're<00:00:53.090> visualizing<00:00:53.960> an<00:00:54.260> octave<00:00:54.620> higher<00:00:54.649> so

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
you're visualizing an octave higher so

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.299 
you're visualizing an octave higher so
that's<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.760> G<00:00:56.000> knows<00:00:56.540> but<00:00:56.989> not<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.170> G<00:00:57.469> well<00:00:57.890> notice

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
that's a G knows but not a G well notice

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.500 
that's a G knows but not a G well notice
that<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:58.700> a<00:00:58.790> d<00:01:00.340> that's<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.520> D<00:01:01.760> there<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:02.480> I

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
that it's a d that's the D there so I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.329 
that it's a d that's the D there so I
visualize<00:01:03.020> daddy<00:01:03.320> an<00:01:03.440> octave<00:01:03.739> higher<00:01:03.770> and<00:01:04.250> I

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
visualize daddy an octave higher and I

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.310 
visualize daddy an octave higher and I
just<00:01:04.550> touch<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.180> put<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.630> pic<00:01:05.810> between<00:01:06.170> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
just touch it I put the pic between the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.100 
just touch it I put the pic between the
second<00:01:06.740> finger<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.520> my<00:01:07.610> thumb<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.149> just

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
second finger and my thumb and just

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.980 
second finger and my thumb and just
touch<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.530> string<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.430> d<00:01:10.960> where<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
touch the string on that d where the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.389 
touch the string on that d where the
hallmark<00:01:12.410> would<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.679> just<00:01:12.890> very<00:01:13.130> lightly

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
hallmark would be just very lightly

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.550 
hallmark would be just very lightly
enough<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.910> raise<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.959> octave<00:01:17.319> just<00:01:18.319> like<00:01:18.440> you

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
enough to raise it octave just like you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.100 
enough to raise it octave just like you
would<00:01:18.649> do<00:01:18.830> here<00:01:19.069> and<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.869> matter<00:01:21.020> of

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
would do here and it's a matter of

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.540 
would do here and it's a matter of
getting<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.410> coordination<00:01:21.950> between<00:01:22.069> the<00:01:22.310> pic

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
getting the coordination between the pic

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.669 
getting the coordination between the pic
and<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.819> finger<00:01:23.209> and<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.780> right<00:01:23.990> amount<00:01:24.590> of

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
and that finger and the right amount of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.580 
and that finger and the right amount of
pressure<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:25.220> barely<00:01:25.580> touching<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.720> you

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
pressure just barely touching and you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.730 
pressure just barely touching and you
can<00:01:27.740> just<00:01:27.920> first<00:01:28.399> just<00:01:28.610> by<00:01:28.759> crosswords

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:43.230 

you<00:01:33.430> can<00:01:33.610> play<00:01:33.880> scales<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.759> it's<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.970> matter<00:01:43.119> of

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
you can play scales so it's a matter of

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.820 
you can play scales so it's a matter of
getting<00:01:43.390> used<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.840> being<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.200> first<00:01:44.470> all<00:01:44.619> being

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
getting used to being it first all being

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.260 
getting used to being it first all being
able<00:01:45.009> finger<00:01:45.310> down<00:01:45.490> here<00:01:45.729> without<00:01:45.820> having<00:01:46.210> to

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
able finger down here without having to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.789 
able finger down here without having to
look<00:01:46.360> at<00:01:46.509> your<00:01:46.600> fingers<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.140> then

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
look at your fingers and then

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.679 
look at your fingers and then
visualizing<00:01:48.549> wear<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:48.909> same<00:01:49.180> scale<00:01:49.539> would

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
visualizing wear that same scale would

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.749 
visualizing wear that same scale would
be<00:01:49.869> an<00:01:49.960> octave<00:01:50.259> higher<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.740> then<00:01:51.250> get<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
be an octave higher and then get in the

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.219 
be an octave higher and then get in the
coordination<00:01:52.119> between<00:01:52.330> your<00:01:52.659> pics<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.200> your

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
coordination between your pics and your

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.719 
coordination between your pics and your
finger<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:55.330> remember<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.229> won<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.619> early<00:01:56.890> red

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
finger I remember I won the early red

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.520 
finger I remember I won the early red
norvo<00:01:57.970> trio<00:01:58.360> records<00:01:58.750> with<00:01:58.929> how<00:01:59.080> follow<00:01:59.380> I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
norvo trio records with how follow I

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.200 
norvo trio records with how follow I
think<00:02:00.220> he'd<00:02:00.310> first<00:02:00.520> started<00:02:00.850> doing<00:02:00.939> he<00:02:01.149> was

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
think he'd first started doing he was

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.730 
think he'd first started doing he was
just<00:02:01.390> playing<00:02:01.539> a<00:02:01.720> very<00:02:01.840> simple<00:02:02.229> melody<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
just playing a very simple melody that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:21.270 
just playing a very simple melody that
way<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.159> like<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.380> then<00:02:20.590> like<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.769> year<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.069> so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
way I like it and then like a year or so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.070 
way I like it and then like a year or so
later<00:02:21.310> after<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.060> plane<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.600> read<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:23.049> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
later after the plane was read for a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.750 
later after the plane was read for a
years<00:02:23.470> old<00:02:23.709> playing<00:02:23.950> all<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> sudden<00:02:24.610> he's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
years old playing all the sudden he's

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.180 
years old playing all the sudden he's
playing<00:02:30.480> when<00:02:31.480> all<00:02:31.660> very<00:02:31.959> very<00:02:32.500> busy<00:02:32.680> solos

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
playing when all very very busy solos

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.880 
playing when all very very busy solos
with<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> arm<00:02:33.910> oxen<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.480> 20<00:02:35.200> years<00:02:35.349> later<00:02:35.560> he

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
with the arm oxen and 20 years later he

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.710 
with the arm oxen and 20 years later he
had<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> guitar<00:02:36.640> with<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> back<00:02:37.209> pick<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.570> as

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
had a guitar with the back pick up as

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720 
had a guitar with the back pick up as
well<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.049> he<00:02:38.170> was<00:02:38.290> playing<00:02:38.560> two<00:02:39.310> octaves

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
well and he was playing two octaves

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
well and he was playing two octaves
above<00:02:39.850> which<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.930> can't<00:02:41.140> do<00:02:41.320> very<00:02:41.500> well<00:02:41.620> but

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.610 

anyhow<00:02:47.920> he<00:02:48.459> really<00:02:48.760> had<00:02:49.380> developed<00:02:50.380> that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
anyhow he really had developed that

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.640 
anyhow he really had developed that
technique<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> fine<00:02:51.640> thing<00:02:52.480> actually<00:02:53.109> 10

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
technique to a fine thing actually 10

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.949 
technique to a fine thing actually 10
years<00:02:53.859> ago<00:02:54.040> before<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.670> jet<00:02:55.090> on<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:55.840> of

years ago before that jet on one of

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.780 
years ago before that jet on one of

actually Django Reinhardt's first record
of<00:02:57.910> nuage<00:02:58.239> he<00:02:59.140> starts<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.739> solo<00:03:00.070> some

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
of nuage he starts a solo some

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.979 
of nuage he starts a solo some
artificial<00:03:00.670> harmonics<00:03:01.269> but<00:03:01.510> he<00:03:01.630> only<00:03:01.720> does

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
artificial harmonics but he only does

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.470 
artificial harmonics but he only does
like<00:03:02.260> four<00:03:03.100> bars<00:03:03.340> are<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:03.700> many<00:03:03.910> switches<00:03:04.180> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
like four bars are so many switches the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.270 
like four bars are so many switches the
pick<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:05.019> playing<00:03:05.380> acoustic<00:03:05.680> guitar<00:03:05.920> and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
pick is it playing acoustic guitar and

microphone didn't have quite the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:18.880 
microphone didn't have quite the
sustained<00:03:08.319> so<00:03:08.620> remember<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.190> think<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.489> was

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
there's so people use those harmonics a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.100 
there's so people use those harmonics a
