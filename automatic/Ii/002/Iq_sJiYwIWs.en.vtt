00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
 hello guys my name is to the world and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.650
 today we talk about theories and facts 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.490
 white nights at freddy's games first 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 let's talk about the third part on 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.980
 site game developer can be found 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.869
 black picture and if include 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.879
 lightening then you can see a big 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.449
 number 3 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:38.420
 this is supposedly a hint of the third part 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.250
 their characters exactly 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.250
 unknown number but characters 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.079
 there will be many in the third part of the first 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 character is like balun fight man i 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 I do not know his name and I did not read it 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.390
 nothing just throw you a link to the site 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.910
 he is very similar to the second balun 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.149
 character is baby Freddy 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 I mean, little Freddie, he will 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.670
 help big with freddie on stage he 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 will dance and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.630
 and say i love you kids still 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.640
 supposedly in this part in 3 there will be a character then 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.060
 there are two characters this is broken 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.159
 puppet and broken balun fight but this 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.509
 again photoshop because you can see that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.250
 just otfotoshopili as to before 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.090
 then a photo of a purple person 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.450
 and there will be five or six cats of different 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.460
 that's all I learned the third part 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 let's talk about bite 87 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.459
 as we know this bite occurred in 1987 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.049
 year I mean the events of the second part well, you 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.530
 probably already know what the second part 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.950
 is a prequel who does not know what 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 such a prequel then this event before the first 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.899
 parts ie events of the first part 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.110
 occur 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.960
 god 2 in general 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.360
 children played with mangle well you probably know 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.140
 mango they again tore pieces from her 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 broke it and of course foxy and decided 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.380
 stand up for her and then he bit 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.440
 the girl who broke the grill but together 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:37.080
 with other guys 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.230
 so let's say and here he bit off her half 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.850
 heads and she somehow survived but I don't know 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.740
 how is she there 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.410
 bit and that's why he staggers all 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.560
 and his jaw is also considered 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.520
 there is a myth that in the first part there is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 some 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.640
 a horse with a mutilated face named 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.120
 ronnie and this horse appears 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.330
 one percent chance of a hundred but if she 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.590
 it appears that you consider it very 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.950
 very lucky but this is again a myth I do not 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.350
 I know the truth is not true in general if for 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.069
 follow them and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.420
 don't look at her and just 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:29.010
 don't watch her don't know no places 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.469
 scare her there then a screamer will appear and 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.650
 just paint the game that's all let's 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.599
 talk about kidnapping five kids like 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.760
 do you remember 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.760
 marionette kidnapped children 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.780
 and merit suits animatronics but 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.500
 one child managed to hide 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.670
 I mean it was mike schmit hero first 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.250
 parts of the game for which we play in general 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.519
 when they were stuck in four costumes 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.450
 children, this suit in a suit in Freddie 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.299
 bonny suit 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.360
 and in golden costume Freddie 5 hid 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.180
 at that time and then when he them 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.789
 we put Freddie's puppet in costumes 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.830
 released gu because he considered himself 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:26.610
 the smartest and still considered and until 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.169
 they lost control of themselves 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.050
 so they started to attack the shirt 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.630
 smith it even in the song is sung that he these 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.150
 the door knows he was probably hiding in it 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.520
 office then the song is sung that in the song 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.270
 more precisely, they lost control 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.870
 And on the Internet, I found 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.620
 this picture is supposedly this golden freddy is worth 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.500
 in the pose of a broken Freddy from the second part 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.830
 In general, this is all I managed to find out 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.960
 today if you learned a lot of new 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.310

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.350

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.350
