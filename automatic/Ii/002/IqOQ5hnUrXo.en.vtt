00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.420 
could be a really good game I was really
trying<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> hundred-plus<00:01:44.130> at

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
trying to go for the hundred-plus at

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.780 
trying to go for the hundred-plus at
this<00:01:44.579> point<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.630> uh<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.920> guys<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this point but uh as you guys can see it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.350 
this point but uh as you guys can see it
just<00:01:47.820> didn't<00:01:48.299> work<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.860> off<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
just didn't work out I was too off and I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.270 
just didn't work out I was too off and I
went<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.290> watched<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.770> game<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
went back and watched this game and I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
went back and watched this game and I
realized<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> made<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> couple<00:01:54.060> mistakes<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
realized I made a couple mistakes that I

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.649 
realized I made a couple mistakes that I
could<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> hundred-plus<00:01:56.759> but

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
could have got the hundred-plus but

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.300 
could have got the hundred-plus but
right<00:01:59.289> here<00:01:59.499> they<00:01:59.649> were<00:01:59.710> all<00:01:59.920> back<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.159> their

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
right here they were all back in their

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.889 
right here they were all back in their
spawn<00:02:00.579> I<00:02:00.609> was<00:02:00.850> trying<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.119> spawn<00:02:01.390> trap<00:02:01.689> him<00:02:01.869> a

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
spawn I was trying to spawn trap him a

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.249 
spawn I was trying to spawn trap him a
little<00:02:02.109> bit<00:02:02.200> but<00:02:02.950> uh<00:02:03.009> my<00:02:03.999> teammates<00:02:04.479> were<00:02:04.749> back

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
little bit but uh my teammates were back

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.230 
little bit but uh my teammates were back
here<00:02:05.439> flipping<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.890> spawns<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:07.000> guess

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
here flipping the spawns and I guess

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.690 
here flipping the spawns and I guess
since<00:02:07.719> there<00:02:07.960> was<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> lodestar<00:02:08.679> yep<00:02:09.069> they

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
since there was a lodestar yep they

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.890 
since there was a lodestar yep they
didn't<00:02:09.970> really<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.330> much<00:02:10.360> else<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.170> go<00:02:11.260> for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
didn't really have much else to go for

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.050 
didn't really have much else to go for
and<00:02:13.900> they're<00:02:14.860> still<00:02:15.129> spawning<00:02:15.489> back<00:02:15.790> here

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and they're still spawning back here

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.240 
and they're still spawning back here
which<00:02:16.299> is<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> good<00:02:17.049> thing<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.709> made<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.220> lot

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
which is a good thing it made it a lot

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.270 
which is a good thing it made it a lot
easier<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.940> get<00:02:19.030> those<00:02:19.299> uh<00:02:19.379> kills<00:02:20.379> musta

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
easier to get those uh kills musta

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.559 
easier to get those uh kills musta
capture<00:02:21.670> right<00:02:21.819> there<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.060> could<00:02:22.239> not<00:02:22.420> believe

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569

crazy but it just uh it just hasn't
worked<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:21.700> for<00:03:22.000> me<00:03:22.060> at<00:03:22.299> all<00:03:23.579> but<00:03:24.579> uh<00:03:24.639> yeah<00:03:25.269> I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
worked out for me at all but uh yeah I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.990 
worked out for me at all but uh yeah I
really<00:03:26.380> wasn't<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:27.069> for<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.700> kind<00:03:27.940> of

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
really wasn't going for this kind of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.550 
really wasn't going for this kind of
game<00:03:28.120> play<00:03:28.389> but<00:03:28.599> once<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.870> started<00:03:29.230> out<00:03:29.349> like

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
game play but once it started out like

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.699 
game play but once it started out like
that<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.430> had<00:03:30.609> my<00:03:30.849> load<00:03:31.630> star<00:03:31.989> in<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.410> first

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
that and I had my load star in the first

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.120 
that and I had my load star in the first
like<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.790> think<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.120> was<00:03:34.239> like<00:03:34.389> 15<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.380> 30<00:03:35.709> points

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
like I think it was like 15 to 30 points

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.430 
like I think it was like 15 to 30 points
of<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.310> game<00:03:36.340> I'm<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.359> whoa<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:38.109> could<00:03:38.410> be

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
of the game I'm like whoa this could be

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.490 
of the game I'm like whoa this could be
a<00:03:38.829> pretty<00:03:39.190> good<00:03:39.400> gameplay<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:41.109> few<00:03:41.349> guys

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
