00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.530
 hello we are with doctor francisco 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.269
 lopez jiménez cardiologist of the clinic 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.509
 may 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.949
 kausar welcome thank you very much 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.330
 would like us to start talking 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.480
 about what it is that makes a 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.189
 cardiologist a cardiologist takes care of 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.239
 care of heart disease 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:27.329
 and from the arteries well I know that you 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.849
 is especially interested in 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.539
 preventive cardiology that is to prevent 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.219
 heart problems 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.710
 and some of the things we can do 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.289
 to prevent our little heart from 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.520
 sick what are those things that are 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.840
 have shown that they prevent 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.420
 Heart diseases are 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.130
 relatively simple are doing 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.520
 exercise in a regular way be 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.270
 active having a healthy diet low in 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.739
 animal fats and low in sugar as well 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.950
 how to have control of the pressure 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.360
 arterial blood cholesterol 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.150
 sugar and to avoid good tobacco and for 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.060
 example we have seen what 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.820
 many of the people are having 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.800
 heart problems and in fact it is a 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.340
 of the leading causes of death in 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.020
 us and is one of the main causes 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 also death elsewhere in the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.619
 world 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.509
 what is it that people are not 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.070
 doing the things that have to be 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.299
 doing I think they are a problem 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.299
 complex then the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.120
 civilization the progress of being 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.750
 human have taken us to a life where 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.760
 we have to move less where the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 things are easier where it is required 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.940
 less energy expenditure or less 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.740
 activities that together with the facility 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.950
 to have foods that are not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 necessarily healthy that's what 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.290
 combined has caused diseases 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.840
 of the heart they have taken the number one 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.590
 in the main cases as the main 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 cause of death both in the us in the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.540
 world and in virtually every country 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.350
 Latin and Latin American but if it's something 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.480
 that we can modify clear that if 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.220
 estimated that approximately 70 percent 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.740
 of heart disease is 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.650
 can prevent with style changes of 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.989
 70 percent life 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.820
 wow there is no there are not many diseases 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.770
 where we have so much impact 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.940
 exactly there are not so many diseases 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.300
 where we much control as 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.100
 in what may happen to us in the future 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.220
 well then it is in our 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.220
 hands 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.020
 Well, we invite you to see other 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.390
 videos where the doctor lópez jiménez 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.070
 will give us other recommendations 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.570
 important where we can have control 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.130
 about what we can do with our 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.130
 lives doctor thank you
