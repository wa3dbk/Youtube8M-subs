mage<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.689> great<00:00:04.020> example<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.770> class<00:00:04.950> that

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
mage is a great example of a class that

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.230 
mage is a great example of a class that
works<00:00:05.279> really<00:00:05.430> well<00:00:05.520> with<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.850> talent

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
works really well with this talent

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.600 
works really well with this talent
system<00:00:06.540> because<00:00:07.189> historically<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.400> always

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
system because historically we always

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.360 
system because historically we always
had<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.090> lot<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.929> most<00:00:10.110> fun<00:00:10.410> abilities<00:00:11.099> for

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
had a lot of the most fun abilities for

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.370 
had a lot of the most fun abilities for
crowd<00:00:11.670> control<00:00:11.700> survivability<00:00:12.570> utility<00:00:13.259> and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
crowd control survivability utility and

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.959 
crowd control survivability utility and
frost<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.070> then<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.490> always<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.820> trouble

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
frost and then we always have trouble

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.490 
frost and then we always have trouble
increasing<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> damage<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.260> they<00:00:16.379> had

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
increasing the damage because they had

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
increasing the damage because they had
so<00:00:16.529> much<00:00:16.859> utility<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.180> figured<00:00:18.510> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so much utility here so we figured it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.849 
so much utility here so we figured it
would<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> fun<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> take<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
would be a lot of fun just to take the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.230 
would be a lot of fun just to take the
utility<00:00:20.400> put<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> through<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> talent

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
utility put it through out the talent

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.259 
utility put it through out the talent
tree<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> then<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.410> let<00:00:22.590> frosty<00:00:23.269> different

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
tree and then just let frosty different

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.550 
tree and then just let frosty different
different<00:00:24.750> types<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.109> damage<00:00:25.380> because

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
different types of damage because

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.140 
different types of damage because
obviously<00:00:25.650> you're<00:00:25.949> doing<00:00:26.189> frost<00:00:26.490> damage<00:00:26.699> here

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
obviously you're doing frost damage here

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
obviously you're doing frost damage here
then<00:00:27.449> arcane<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.260> fire<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.970> brave<00:00:30.150> new

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
then arcane and fire in this brave new

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.200 
then arcane and fire in this brave new
world<00:00:31.309> arcane<00:00:32.309> blast<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.820> our<00:00:32.969> Cain<00:00:33.180> only

fireball is fire only in crossville this

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
fireball is fire only in crossville this
frost<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:38.239> now<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.390> crazy<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> level<00:00:42.540> 15<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
frost over now it's crazy so level 15 is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.220 
frost over now it's crazy so level 15 is
a<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.290> chilly<00:00:43.590> tier<00:00:44.539> we<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> existing

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
a very chilly tier we have the existing

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.540 
a very chilly tier we have the existing
ring<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> frost<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.890> probably<00:00:47.190> wins<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> award

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
ring of frost it probably wins the award

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
ring of frost it probably wins the award
for<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> most<00:00:48.360> levels<00:00:48.780> jumped<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> way

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
for the most levels jumped all the way

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
for the most levels jumped all the way
down<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> 15<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:52.199> goes<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.530> against<00:00:52.829> cone<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
down to 15 it goes up against cone of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.560 
down to 15 it goes up against cone of
cold<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> improved<00:00:54.239> cone<00:00:54.449> up

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
cold and this is the improved cone up

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
cold and this is the improved cone up
old<00:00:54.750> version<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.920> freezes<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
old version so it also freezes so the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.700 
old version so it also freezes so the
only<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.960> pulled<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.260> there's<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> one

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
only kind of pulled out there's the one

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
only kind of pulled out there's the one
that<00:00:58.829> freezes<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> don't<00:00:59.579> get<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.090> kind

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
that freezes and you don't get just kind

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.080 
that freezes and you don't get just kind
of<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> lame<00:01:00.539> cone<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.870> cold<00:01:00.899> without<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
of a lame cone of cold without that and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.820 
of a lame cone of cold without that and
then<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> new<00:01:03.270> way<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> freezing<00:01:03.780> frost<00:01:04.589> jaw

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
then a new way of freezing frost jaw

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.540 
then a new way of freezing frost jaw
which<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.460> silence<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> freeze<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> target

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.570 

okay<00:01:13.330> i<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:14.680> mentioning<00:01:15.070> with<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.250> Warlock

to<00:01:18.910> be<00:01:19.030> like<00:01:19.210> slippery<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.020> glass<00:01:20.290> cannon<00:01:20.770> ii

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
to be like slippery and glass cannon ii

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.930 
to be like slippery and glass cannon ii
where<00:01:21.010> we<00:01:21.070> want<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.340> try<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.580> shift<00:01:21.820> the

kind of help may just survive and get
away<00:01:29.160> greater<00:01:30.160> invisibility<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.850> an<00:01:30.940> upgrade

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
away greater invisibility is an upgrade

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.780 
away greater invisibility is an upgrade
to<00:01:31.240> invisibility<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:32.230> know<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.790> replayed

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
to invisibility you know that replayed

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.830 
to invisibility you know that replayed
it<00:01:33.940> doesn't<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:34.330> case<00:01:34.510> it<00:01:34.600> does<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.720> really
