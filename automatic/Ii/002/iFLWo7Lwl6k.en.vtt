00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.580
 good yummy friends we started the 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.320
 second season of youtube with one of 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.510
 the questions that I have the most by mail that 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.539
 it's like approaching we're not going to do two 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.230
 types of liquid candy preparation 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 I usually have it in the fridge 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 It is perfect for making pudding to make 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 a plane or good to accompany some 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 ice cream for example and candy for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.879
 decorate that candy that stays 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.339
 pretty consistent that we can do 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.790
 forms for which we are going to help or 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:41.250
 either from the countertop itself or from one of 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.110
 a silicone sheet can also be 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.500
 make with baking paper 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.540
 let's use sugar logically water 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 let's dramatize with a little bit of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.329
 lemon you can also use if you want 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 orange to another citrus or even give it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.870
 touches of coffee that come too 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.969
 Well that depends on the type of dessert 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.660
 that you are going to do or how you want 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.770
 go out the candy we go to the kitchen 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.350
 I hope that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 that you learn and that if you have any 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 doubt and you ask me to do 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.500
 liquid candy we need sugar water 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.350
 and a few drops of lemon 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.440
 Well, we're already in the kitchen in the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.510
 new kitchen saints and we have a frying pan 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.960
 and a dipper in this case we're going to add 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.510
 200 grams of sugar and 4 tablespoons of 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.460
 water a teaspoon of lemon that is the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.280
 that is going to give a touch we are going to 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.930
 help with a special spatula on 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.080
 everything so that it does not melt 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.940
 Holds up to 300 degrees the candy goes 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.890
 to reach temperatures of 200 with what 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.380
 which is dangerous with this we are going to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.869
 get a candy and that candy 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.960
 hard hard almost as if it were the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.910
 candies that we buy there in the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.640
 stores what we want are two 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.740
 preparations on the one hand this and for 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.570
 another a liquid caramel that is the one 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.979
 we will use then then to do 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.739
 another type of desserts you see that it already starts 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:13.010
 the candy to catch temperature at the same time 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.500
 we are going to add here 12 tablespoons of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.040
 water we need this water to be 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.410
 hot we add 2 teaspoons more per 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.290
 the water that is going to evaporate the spoon 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.640
 we also let it be hot and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.100
 when he starts to catch 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.860
 golden is when we are going to reduce a little 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.630
 the temperature of the candy so it does not 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.420
 burn us because if not what is going to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.910
 to do is to embitter and that we do not want 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.390
 you see that it is already changing totally 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.220
 color 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.590
 we want it to be dark but always 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.050
 without burning and with patience do not have 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.850
 Hurry that this then we have left for a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.310
 a lot of time this is sugar and I do not know 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.190
 will spoil us you see that we already have 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.709
 the candy we left it at 1 and what 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.080
 what we are going to do is to introduce 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.670
 little by little the water but before we go to 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.330
 do some little pictures here so you can see 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.620
 How to solidify and then decorate 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.260
 little things here and there and what 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.170
 we let cool and you'll see good 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.380
 they can make and the candy bits 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.200
 or guirlache even as we want to 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.540
 this is liquid candy we are going to give 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.860
 very little temperature and we are going to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.410
 start adding the water that is already 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.959
 hot one at a time and always 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.209
 removing being careful because it reaches 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.000
 jump like here right now you must 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.170
 have about 150 grams of sugar 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 approximately we are going to add 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.660
 about 6 tablespoons 8 tablespoons of water and 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.280
 stir well and let it turn off 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.280
 this cool down a bit and we already have our 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.520
 candy ready easy not for guys nothing 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.870
 until next week I hope that 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.569
 you have learned a trick plus a 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.260
 yummy trick and with this you go to 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.140
 can make a multitude of desserts 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.379
 good week and see you later 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.379
 yummy
