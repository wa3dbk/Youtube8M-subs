here<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:13.950> I<00:06:14.760> know<00:06:14.850> it's<00:06:15.030> kind<00:06:15.210> of<00:06:15.240> short

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
here and I know it's kind of short

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.060 
here and I know it's kind of short
episode<00:06:15.780> around<00:06:15.870> like<00:06:16.110> five<00:06:16.350> six<00:06:16.740> minutes

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
episode around like five six minutes

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.170 
episode around like five six minutes
only<00:06:17.190> but<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.580> reason<00:06:17.700> for<00:06:17.940> that<00:06:17.970> is<00:06:18.150> because

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
only but the reason for that is because

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.510 
only but the reason for that is because
we<00:06:18.480> we<00:06:18.750> just<00:06:18.960> finished<00:06:19.260> killing<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.680> boss<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.190> I

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
we we just finished killing a boss and I

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
we we just finished killing a boss and I
think<00:06:20.730> that<00:06:20.850> should<00:06:20.970> be<00:06:21.030> an<00:06:21.150> episode<00:06:21.450> in
