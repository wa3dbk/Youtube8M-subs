00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pad directional pad thing it almost

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
pad directional pad thing it almost
looks<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.579> analog<00:01:59.909> stick<00:02:00.299> but

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
looks like a like an analog stick but

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.080 
looks like a like an analog stick but
it's<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.049> don't<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.520> um<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.759> then

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it's not I don't think um and then

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's not I don't think um and then
there's<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.840> controller<00:02:04.729> now<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
there's also a controller now the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
there's also a controller now the
controller<00:02:06.299> features<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.079> know<00:02:07.170> everything

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
controller features you know everything

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.550 
controller features you know everything
you<00:02:07.619> would<00:02:07.710> find<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.399> basically<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.569> dual<00:02:10.229> shock

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
you would find in basically a dual shock

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.260 
you would find in basically a dual shock
for<00:02:10.800> basically<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.610> pretty<00:02:11.760> much<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> dual

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
for basically it's pretty much a dual

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.260 
for basically it's pretty much a dual
shock<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.690> butt-ugly

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
shock for butt-ugly

saying
alright<00:03:35.350> that's<00:03:35.560> that's<00:03:35.800> kind<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.040> cool<00:03:36.250> too

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
alright that's that's kind of cool too

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.160 
alright that's that's kind of cool too
bad<00:03:36.610> it'll<00:03:36.850> sort<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.330> know<00:03:37.360> divide<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
bad it'll sort of you know divide the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.800 
bad it'll sort of you know divide the
the<00:03:38.470> chromecast<00:03:38.740> community<00:03:39.600> but<00:03:40.600> at<00:03:40.690> least

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the chromecast community but at least

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.840 
the chromecast community but at least
it's<00:03:41.050> like<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.230> an<00:03:41.650> iteration<00:03:42.280> maybe<00:03:42.700> will<00:03:42.820> be

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
it's like a an iteration maybe will be

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.430 
it's like a an iteration maybe will be
faster<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.540> better<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.080> know<00:03:44.230> have

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
faster and better and you know have

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.900 
faster and better and you know have
better<00:03:44.650> software<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.280> something<00:03:45.459> like<00:03:45.700> that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
better software or something like that

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.030 
better software or something like that
and<00:03:46.120> then<00:03:47.020> this<00:03:47.200> comes<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.890> I'm<00:03:48.010> just

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.790 
and then this comes out and I'm just
like<00:03:48.370> um<00:03:49.230> what<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:52.090> just<00:03:52.300> seems<00:03:52.450> clunky<00:03:53.020> really

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800

outlet you can't use a USB plug like you

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.510 
outlet you can't use a USB plug like you
can<00:04:01.930> with<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.110> chromecast<00:04:02.350> which<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.770> again<00:04:03.040> one

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
can with a chromecast which is again one

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.680 
can with a chromecast which is again one
of<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.670> greatest<00:04:04.150> features<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.630> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
of the greatest features of the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.390 
of the greatest features of the
chromecast<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:06.760> has<00:04:06.910> an<00:04:07.030> HDMI<00:04:07.510> port<00:04:07.540> and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
chromecast it has an HDMI port and

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.740 
chromecast it has an HDMI port and
that's<00:04:09.400> about<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.970> believe<00:04:10.360> there<00:04:10.570> might

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750

it just reminds me of the Nexus Q and we
all<00:06:48.290> know<00:06:48.440> how<00:06:48.590> that<00:06:48.770> went<00:06:49.090> it<00:06:50.090> didn't<00:06:50.330> even

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
come out because Google realized it was

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.380 
come out because Google realized it was
pointless<00:06:55.060> they<00:06:56.060> should<00:06:56.240> have<00:06:56.330> just

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
pointless they should have just

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.390 
pointless they should have just
reiterated<00:06:57.140> the<00:06:57.200> chromecast<00:06:57.710> or<00:06:57.890> updated<00:06:58.340> the

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
chromecast or software and it would have

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.760 
chromecast or software and it would have
been<00:07:01.130> awesome<00:07:01.900> instead<00:07:02.900> they're<00:07:03.470> further

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
been awesome instead they're further

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.800 
been awesome instead they're further
dividing<00:07:04.370> the<00:07:04.430> market<00:07:04.580> and<00:07:05.180> just<00:07:05.450> gets<00:07:05.630> so

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
dividing the market and just gets so

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.200 
dividing the market and just gets so
