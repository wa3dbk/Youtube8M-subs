00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
past week I've been busily working on

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.549 
past week I've been busily working on
the<00:00:37.649> inner<00:00:37.860> frame<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.399> GPO<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.469> painting<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the inner frame of GPO one painting the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
the inner frame of GPO one painting the
inner<00:00:40.710> frame<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.329> I'll<00:00:42.540> move<00:00:42.719> on

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
inner frame first and then I'll move on

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650 
inner frame first and then I'll move on
to<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.260> outer<00:00:43.890> armor<00:00:44.340> which<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.820> usually<00:00:45.510> what

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to the outer armor which is usually what

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.319 
to the outer armor which is usually what
I<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.079> most<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.590> my<00:00:46.879> model<00:00:47.879> kits<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I do for most of my model kits that have

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.180 
I do for most of my model kits that have
an<00:00:48.420> inner<00:00:48.539> frame<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:51.379> what<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> decided<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> do

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
an inner frame so what I decided to do

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.290 
an inner frame so what I decided to do
with<00:00:53.309> GPO<00:00:53.789> one<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.770> basically<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.399> use<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
with GPO one was to basically just use a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.340 
with GPO one was to basically just use a
bunch<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.289> different<00:00:58.770> colors<00:00:59.600> is<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
bunch of different colors is on the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.349 
bunch of different colors is on the
inner<00:01:01.469> frame<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> make<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.550> detailed<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
inner frame and make it as detailed as I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.200 
inner frame and make it as detailed as I
possibly<00:01:03.809> could

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
possibly could

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
possibly could
because<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.510> previous<00:01:06.780> three<00:01:07.650> perfect

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
because on my previous three perfect

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.410 
because on my previous three perfect
grades<00:01:08.450> Oryx<00:01:09.450> Evan<00:01:09.720> T<00:01:09.780> 8w<00:01:10.320> riser<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> astray

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
grades Oryx Evan T 8w riser and astray

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.520 
grades Oryx Evan T 8w riser and astray
for<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> inner<00:01:12.689> frame<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.500> less

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
for the inner frame I'm more or less

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.859 
for the inner frame I'm more or less
just<00:01:13.710> spray<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> entire<00:01:15.180> inner<00:01:15.390> frame<00:01:15.630> one

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
just spray the entire inner frame one

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.530 
just spray the entire inner frame one
solid<00:01:16.290> color<00:01:16.790> gunmetal<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> case<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
solid color gunmetal in the case of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710 
solid color gunmetal in the case of
Gundam<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> double<00:01:19.740> O<00:01:19.799> riser<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.720> gold

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Gundam and double O riser and then gold

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830 
Gundam and double O riser and then gold
in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> case<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> astray<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
in the case of the astray so for this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
in the case of the astray so for this
guy<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.610> decided<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.409> go<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.490> multiple<00:01:29.490> shades

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
guy I decided to go with multiple shades

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
guy I decided to go with multiple shades
of<00:01:29.970> gray<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:30.600> using<00:01:30.900> three

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
of gray I'm actually using three

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.440 
of gray I'm actually using three
different<00:01:31.799> shades<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.189> grey<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:33.299> I'm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
different shades of grey and then I'm

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
different shades of grey and then I'm
also<00:01:33.600> using<00:01:33.950> silver<00:01:34.950> gunmetal<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.150> gold<00:01:37.040> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
also using silver gunmetal and gold and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
also using silver gunmetal and gold and
so<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.000> end<00:01:39.180> product<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.840> something<00:01:40.140> like

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
so the end product is something like

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.850 
so the end product is something like
this<00:01:41.360> where<00:01:42.360> I've<00:01:42.509> got<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.430> three

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
this where I've got like one to three

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.270 
this where I've got like one to three
different<00:01:46.860> shades<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:48.110> gray<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.710> I've

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
different shades of gray on here I've

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
different shades of gray on here I've
got<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.850> silver<00:01:51.240> accents<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
got some little silver accents here and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.830 
got some little silver accents here and
there<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> few<00:01:54.299> places<00:01:54.420> I've

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there and then just in a few places I've

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.499 
there and then just in a few places I've
used<00:01:55.049> gold<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.920> pretty<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.240> only

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
used gold actually pretty much the only

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
used gold actually pretty much the only
time<00:01:57.689> I'm<00:01:57.990> using<00:01:58.170> gold<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.640> any

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
time I'm using gold is if there are any

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.410 
time I'm using gold is if there are any
pipes<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.799> model<00:02:02.340> kit<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.299> see

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
pipes on the model kit as you can see

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
pipes on the model kit as you can see
there's<00:02:03.659> four<00:02:03.810> small<00:02:04.229> pipes<00:02:04.530> right<00:02:04.740> there

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
there's four small pipes right there

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
there's four small pipes right there
this<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.430> actually<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.939> upper<00:02:06.869> torso

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this is actually the upper torso

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.279 
this is actually the upper torso
shoulder<00:02:08.099> area

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
shoulder area

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.509 
shoulder area
all<00:02:10.739> right<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.650> other<00:02:13.650> upper<00:02:14.340> torso

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
all right here is the other upper torso

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.899 
all right here is the other upper torso
with<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> arms<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.469> head<00:02:16.680> attached<00:02:17.219> as

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
with the arms and the head attached as

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.910 
with the arms and the head attached as
you<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.269> see<00:02:18.420> I've<00:02:18.599> gone<00:02:19.260> ahead<00:02:19.439> and<00:02:19.590> painted

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
you can see I've gone ahead and painted

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.809 
you can see I've gone ahead and painted
the<00:02:20.250> chin<00:02:21.239> piece<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.370> guess<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.519> call

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
the chin piece and I guess you call

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
of silver on there as well I didn't find

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.289 
of silver on there as well I didn't find
myself<00:02:42.769> using<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.040> gunmetal<00:02:44.370> too<00:02:44.670> much<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.060> did

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
myself using the gunmetal too much I did

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.080 
myself using the gunmetal too much I did
use<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.569> like<00:02:45.930> there<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.129> see<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.609> gunmetal

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
use it like there you can see a gunmetal

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.440 
use it like there you can see a gunmetal
on<00:02:48.359> both<00:02:48.599> sides<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.169> gold<00:02:49.560> pipe<00:02:49.859> there

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
on both sides of that gold pipe there

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.909 
on both sides of that gold pipe there
but<00:02:51.450> really<00:02:51.900> by<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.079> time<00:02:52.169> I<00:02:52.349> got<00:02:52.560> done<00:02:52.769> with

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
but really by the time I got done with

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.990 
but really by the time I got done with
the<00:02:52.980> grays<00:02:53.909> and<00:02:53.939> the<00:02:54.359> gold<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.079> silver<00:02:55.109> I

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
the grays and the gold and the silver I

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.210 
the grays and the gold and the silver I
found<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.379> gunmetal<00:02:58.379> really<00:02:58.889> wasn't<00:02:59.069> all

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
found that gunmetal really wasn't all

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.000 
found that gunmetal really wasn't all
that<00:02:59.310> necessary<00:03:00.379> there<00:03:01.379> is<00:03:01.530> one<00:03:01.769> additional

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that necessary there is one additional

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.789 
that necessary there is one additional
color<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.419> piston<00:03:03.959> tubes<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
color for all the piston tubes as you

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.500 
color for all the piston tubes as you
can<00:03:04.919> see<00:03:05.099> like<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.489> little<00:03:05.790> shaft<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
can see like the little shaft of the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.099 
can see like the little shaft of the
piston<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.189> painted<00:03:08.189> silver<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.760> my<00:03:09.750> camera

will<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.349> in<00:03:10.439> focus<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:12.030> shaft<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
will get in focus the shaft of the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.629 
will get in focus the shaft of the
piston<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:12.989> painted<00:03:13.319> silver<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.010> tube<00:03:14.340> of

not by much but a little bit and
obviously<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.890> amount<00:06:30.100> of<00:06:30.190> detail<00:06:30.610> I'm

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
obviously the amount of detail I'm

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.870 
obviously the amount of detail I'm
painting<00:06:31.720> on<00:06:31.930> is<00:06:32.229> going<00:06:33.190> to<00:06:33.280> make<00:06:33.430> all<00:06:33.640> of<00:06:33.760> that

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
painting on is going to make all of that

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.810

little<00:06:35.120> molded<00:06:35.960> on<00:06:36.110> details<00:06:36.530> really<00:06:36.860> pop<00:06:37.670> out

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
little molded on details really pop out

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.300 
little molded on details really pop out
and<00:06:38.090> be<00:06:38.240> noticeable<00:06:41.170> so<00:06:42.170> I<00:06:42.530> guess<00:06:43.010> that<00:06:43.190> about

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
and be noticeable so I guess that about

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.190 
and be noticeable so I guess that about
does<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.640> for<00:06:43.790> this<00:06:44.030> work-in-progress

point<00:07:03.500> I'll<00:07:03.680> be<00:07:03.710> done<00:07:04.070> painting<00:07:04.730> the<00:07:05.210> inner

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
point I'll be done painting the inner

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.950 
point I'll be done painting the inner
frame<00:07:05.780> and<00:07:06.640> then<00:07:07.640> after<00:07:08.540> that<00:07:08.690> I'm<00:07:08.810> probably

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
frame and then after that I'm probably

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.690 
frame and then after that I'm probably
gonna<00:07:09.200> move<00:07:09.350> on<00:07:09.530> to<00:07:09.620> the<00:07:09.800> weapons<00:07:10.190> and<00:07:10.490> then

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
gonna move on to the weapons and then

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.300 
gonna move on to the weapons and then
after<00:07:11.030> that<00:07:11.180> the<00:07:11.360> core<00:07:11.630> fighters<00:07:12.110> and<00:07:12.440> then

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
after that the core fighters and then

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.460 
after that the core fighters and then
after<00:07:14.060> that<00:07:14.210> I'll<00:07:14.420> move<00:07:14.600> on<00:07:14.810> to<00:07:14.960> the<00:07:15.170> outer

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
after that I'll move on to the outer

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.400 
after that I'll move on to the outer
armor<00:07:15.980> of<00:07:16.100> the<00:07:16.130> kit<00:07:16.540> so<00:07:17.540> my<00:07:17.720> next<00:07:18.050> work<00:07:18.230> in

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
armor of the kit so my next work in

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.280 
armor of the kit so my next work in
progress<00:07:18.710> will<00:07:19.690> probably<00:07:20.690> be<00:07:20.870> in<00:07:21.050> about<00:07:21.260> a

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
progress will probably be in about a

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.480 
progress will probably be in about a
week<00:07:21.500> or<00:07:21.620> so<00:07:21.680> I'll<00:07:22.640> probably<00:07:22.940> wait<00:07:23.240> until<00:07:23.600> I've

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
week or so I'll probably wait until I've

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.250 
week or so I'll probably wait until I've
either<00:07:25.490> finished<00:07:26.090> or<00:07:26.300> gotten<00:07:26.690> quite<00:07:26.960> a<00:07:26.990> bit<00:07:27.080> of

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
either finished or gotten quite a bit of

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.810 
either finished or gotten quite a bit of
work<00:07:27.410> done<00:07:27.470> on<00:07:27.830> the<00:07:27.920> core<00:07:28.100> fighters<00:07:28.430> before<00:07:28.760> I

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820 
work done on the core fighters before I

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.060 
work done on the core fighters before I
do<00:07:28.880> another<00:07:29.270> work<00:07:29.750> in<00:07:29.930> progress<00:07:30.140> so<00:07:31.720> yeah

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
do another work in progress so yeah

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.950 
do another work in progress so yeah
that's<00:07:34.070> how<00:07:34.280> this<00:07:34.730> guy's<00:07:34.970> coming<00:07:35.450> along<00:07:35.660> and

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
that's how this guy's coming along and

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.590 
that's how this guy's coming along and
hopefully<00:07:36.280> in<00:07:37.280> a<00:07:37.550> couple<00:07:37.580> weeks<00:07:38.920> we<00:07:39.920> can<00:07:40.600> maybe

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600 
hopefully in a couple weeks we can maybe

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.340 
hopefully in a couple weeks we can maybe
start<00:07:42.020> thinking<00:07:42.080> about<00:07:42.520> the<00:07:43.520> review<00:07:44.110> anyway<00:07:45.110> I

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.350 
start thinking about the review anyway I

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.960 
start thinking about the review anyway I
guess<00:07:45.770> that<00:07:45.950> about<00:07:46.040> does<00:07:46.160> it<00:07:46.370> for<00:07:46.520> this

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:46.970 
guess that about does it for this

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.120 
guess that about does it for this
work-in-progress<00:07:47.600> video<00:07:48.170> and<00:07:48.560> I<00:07:48.890> will<00:07:49.100> see

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.130 
work-in-progress video and I will see

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.450 
work-in-progress video and I will see
you<00:07:49.670> guys<00:07:49.880> next<00:07:50.240> time
