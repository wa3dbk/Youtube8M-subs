00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.410 
figures as I've said but it's not really
for<00:05:37.750> play<00:05:38.230> it<00:05:38.590> breaks<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:39.220> lot<00:05:39.430> of<00:05:39.640> very<00:05:40.030> fragile

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
for play it breaks a lot of very fragile

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.200 
for play it breaks a lot of very fragile
because<00:05:40.960> it's<00:05:41.230> so<00:05:41.440> big<00:05:41.830> I'd<00:05:42.520> say<00:05:42.880> this<00:05:43.030> is

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
because it's so big I'd say this is

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.400 
because it's so big I'd say this is
about<00:05:43.740> 12<00:05:44.740> inches<00:05:45.040> around<00:05:45.750> plus<00:05:46.750> these<00:05:47.110> on

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
about 12 inches around plus these on

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.700 
about 12 inches around plus these on
there<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:48.250> it's<00:05:48.460> very<00:05:48.700> fragile<00:05:49.230> legs<00:05:50.230> if<00:05:50.440> I

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
there so it's very fragile legs if I

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.000 
there so it's very fragile legs if I
don't<00:05:51.220> think<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.840> child<00:05:52.840> could<00:05:53.140> play<00:05:53.620> with<00:05:53.830> this

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
don't think a child could play with this

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.250 
don't think a child could play with this
like<00:05:54.790> I<00:05:54.940> think<00:05:55.150> it's<00:05:55.300> good<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:55.540> just<00:05:55.720> walk<00:05:56.080> on

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
like I think it's good to just walk on

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.110 
like I think it's good to just walk on
the<00:05:56.380> shelf<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:56.890> be<00:05:57.010> on<00:05:57.130> display<00:05:57.340> like<00:05:57.670> I'm

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
the shelf and be on display like I'm

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.370 
the shelf and be on display like I'm
going<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.390> put<00:05:58.540> it<00:05:58.660> because<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.080> can't<00:05:59.110> really

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
going to put it because you can't really

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.320 
going to put it because you can't really
play<00:05:59.770> with<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:01.570> I'm<00:06:02.560> going<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.860> rate<00:06:03.040> this

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
