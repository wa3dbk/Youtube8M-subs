 the cycle of debates and in addition to networks of collaboration diversity 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.620
 cultural 'and power technologies 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.009
 it's an initiative 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.690
 of the free software association nenÃ© of the porto alegre cinema house 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.589
 and of several academics who activists 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.119
 is an unusual meeting that aims to unravel 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.640
 our society 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.960
 air and communication and every idea that technology has a 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.280
 we do not want to enter into these networks. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.600
 collaboration 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.660
 encourage the debate on the clash of emancipated forms 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.060
 that existed in society and that gained a great force in the networks 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.030
 but we also want to show the confrontation that is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.060
 existing between these forms and the old extracorporal groups attending 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.810
 large corporations ii the power that enter the networks through contracts 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.290
 protocols and patterns we want to show 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.890
 or what to subtract 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.350
 within these mediations of these mediatizations that today composes the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.560
 digital culture to cyberculture and what it was necessary for us to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.479
 building a public sphere in this new environment and a public sphere 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260
 interconnected we get 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.230
 bring together the reflection of the activists' universities and hence they assad 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.010
 and communities that created their knowledge and 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.290
 emancipation, it is necessary that this symbolic production be 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.010
 unveiled our idea is 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.620
 I built a seminar 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.070
 that throw light 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.920
 that enters and penetrates into cyberspace and that it is a butt for our 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.160
 face-to-face in order for us to be able to unveil these 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.380
 power 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.050
