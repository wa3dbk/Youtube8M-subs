okay<00:00:01.920> here's<00:00:02.190> what<00:00:02.370> I've<00:00:02.520> been<00:00:02.639> working<00:00:02.790> on

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay here's what I've been working on

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.280 
okay here's what I've been working on
for<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.419> while<00:00:03.650> it's<00:00:04.650> got<00:00:04.859> an<00:00:04.980> alternator<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:05.640> it

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
for a while it's got an alternator on it

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.600 
for a while it's got an alternator on it
generates<00:00:07.290> DC<00:00:07.980> power<00:00:08.540> charges<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.719> battery

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
generates DC power charges that battery

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.740 
generates DC power charges that battery
and<00:00:12.620> then<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.980> take<00:00:14.250> an<00:00:14.370> inverter<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.849> invert

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
and then you take an inverter and invert

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.430 
and then you take an inverter and invert
that<00:00:15.780> power<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.529> AC

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
that power to AC

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.310 
that power to AC
include<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.460> inverter<00:00:19.760> with<00:00:20.060> it<00:00:21.100> it's<00:00:22.100> got<00:00:22.310> a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
include the inverter with it it's got a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.650 
include the inverter with it it's got a
5<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.590> steward<00:00:25.100> on<00:00:25.340> it<00:00:25.520> with<00:00:26.120> forward<00:00:26.510> and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
5 a steward on it with forward and
