00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
wrong

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.290 
wrong
shape<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.740> more<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> vine<00:02:14.610> shape<00:02:15.090> which

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
shape it's more like a vine shape which

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.700 
shape it's more like a vine shape which
you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.630> use<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.050> other<00:02:17.690> decorations<00:02:18.710> so

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
you can use for other decorations so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.830 
you can use for other decorations so
we're<00:02:19.890> gonna<00:02:19.980> do<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> leaf<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.720> way

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
we're gonna do the leaf all the way

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.160 
we're gonna do the leaf all the way
around<00:02:22.230> your<00:02:22.440> cake<00:02:22.740> starting<00:02:23.490> at<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.880> edge

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
around your cake starting at the edge

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.870 
around your cake starting at the edge
just<00:02:25.170> simply<00:02:25.710> apply<00:02:26.250> pressure<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.390> pull<00:02:28.320> and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
just simply apply pressure and pull and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.090 
just simply apply pressure and pull and
you're<00:02:29.880> gonna<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.420> all<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.470> way<00:02:31.620> around

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
you're gonna do that all the way around

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.790 
you're gonna do that all the way around
the<00:02:32.340> outer<00:02:32.520> edge<00:02:33.120> now<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.110> harder<00:02:34.650> you

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
the outer edge now the harder you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.850 
the outer edge now the harder you
squeeze<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:36.360> bigger<00:02:36.630> your<00:02:36.840> leaf<00:02:37.110> comes<00:02:37.530> out

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
squeeze the bigger your leaf comes out

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.690 
squeeze the bigger your leaf comes out
so<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.280> depends<00:02:38.820> really<00:02:40.100> what<00:02:41.100> size<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.580> want

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
so it depends really what size you want

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.820 
so it depends really what size you want
and<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.030> bag<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.540> snapping<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.290> popping<00:02:43.710> I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and my bag is snapping and popping I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.120 
and my bag is snapping and popping I
promise<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.700> icing<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.510> me<00:02:49.130> lots

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
promise that's the icing and not me lots

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.160 
promise that's the icing and not me lots
of<00:02:50.280> air<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> bag<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.450> ever<00:02:51.660> do<00:02:51.990> get

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
of air in the bag and if you ever do get

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
of air in the bag and if you ever do get
that<00:02:52.320> popping<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.920> snapping<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.550> get

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that popping and snapping and you get

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.360 
that popping and snapping and you get
bubbles<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.380> explode<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.340> your

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
bubbles that kind of explode on your

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.830 
bubbles that kind of explode on your
icing<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.520> can<00:02:59.670> just<00:02:59.880> scoop<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.660> put

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
icing you can just scoop that up and put

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.130 
icing you can just scoop that up and put
it<00:03:00.870> back<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.290> your<00:03:01.410> bag<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.810> start<00:03:03.810> over<00:03:03.990> again

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
it back in your bag and start over again

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.470 
it back in your bag and start over again
and<00:03:04.880> basically<00:03:05.880> you're<00:03:06.120> going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.270> want<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and basically you're going to want to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.180 
and basically you're going to want to
push<00:03:06.720> your<00:03:06.900> icing<00:03:07.320> all<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.709> down<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.130> you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
push your icing all the way down so you

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.040 
push your icing all the way down so you
don't<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.459> air<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:09.209> your<00:03:09.330> bag<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:09.870> going

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
don't have air in your bag that's going

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.190 
don't have air in your bag that's going
to<00:03:10.110> cause<00:03:10.940> bubbles<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.450> mess<00:03:12.959> up<00:03:13.170> your

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
to cause bubbles to mess up your

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.310 
to cause bubbles to mess up your
decorations<00:03:14.780> now<00:03:15.780> I'm<00:03:15.900> going<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.200> ahead

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
decorations now I'm going to go ahead

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.800 
decorations now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:16.590> do<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.740> second<00:03:17.340> row<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.640> leaves<00:03:18.420> all<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and do a second row of leaves all the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.780 
and do a second row of leaves all the
way<00:03:18.989> around<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.620> basically<00:03:20.459> you're<00:03:20.670> gonna

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
way around and basically you're gonna

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.940 
way around and basically you're gonna
start<00:03:21.120> at<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.300> base<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.840> first<00:03:22.320> layer<00:03:22.739> of

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
start at the base of your first layer of

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.530 
start at the base of your first layer of
leaves<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.430> you're<00:03:23.580> just<00:03:23.760> gonna<00:03:23.910> overlap

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
leaves and you're just gonna overlap

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.810 
leaves and you're just gonna overlap
right<00:03:24.840> over<00:03:25.230> them<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:26.130> doesn't<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.670> to

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
right over them and it doesn't have to

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.040 
right over them and it doesn't have to
be<00:03:26.940> perfect<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.840> doesn't<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.500> be

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
be perfect it doesn't have to be

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.690 
be perfect it doesn't have to be
perfectly<00:03:31.050> symmetrical<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:32.190> doesn't<00:03:32.489> really

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
perfectly symmetrical it doesn't really

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.640 
perfectly symmetrical it doesn't really
matter<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.450> long<00:03:33.480> as<00:03:33.780> your<00:03:33.900> finished<00:03:34.230> product

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
matter as long as your finished product

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.540 
matter as long as your finished product
is<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.860> circular<00:03:36.410> layer<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.739> leaves<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.430> I'm

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
is a circular layer of leaves so I'm

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.780 
is a circular layer of leaves so I'm
just<00:03:38.870> pulling<00:03:39.950> all<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.160> way<00:03:41.280> around<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.670> was

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
just pulling all the way around that was

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.550 
just pulling all the way around that was
my<00:03:41.910> second<00:03:42.330> layer<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.140> see<00:03:43.350> like

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
my second layer and as you can see like

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.250 
my second layer and as you can see like
for<00:03:43.800> my<00:03:43.890> third<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.700> might<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.720> between<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
for my third I might go in between the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.600 
for my third I might go in between the
two<00:03:46.650> leaves<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.489> pull<00:03:48.860> all<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.190> way<00:03:50.280> around

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
two leaves and pull all the way around

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.580 
two leaves and pull all the way around
and<00:03:50.790> like<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.239> said<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.720> does<00:03:51.900> not<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.470> be

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and like I said it does not have to be

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.360 
and like I said it does not have to be
perfect<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:54.110> go<00:03:55.110> ahead<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.739> go<00:03:55.890> all<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.340> way

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
perfect just go ahead and go all the way

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.759 
perfect just go ahead and go all the way
around<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:57.150> third<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.930> maybe<00:03:58.110> even<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.500> fourth

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
around a third and maybe even a fourth

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.770 
around a third and maybe even a fourth
time<00:03:59.600> so<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.660> went<00:04:00.930> ahead<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.290> finished<00:04:01.800> up<00:04:02.220> my

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
time so I went ahead and finished up my

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.259 
time so I went ahead and finished up my
rows<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:04.260> leaves<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.100> on<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:05.700> cake<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.120> have

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
rows of leaves and on this cake I have

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.810 
rows of leaves and on this cake I have
about<00:04:06.480> five<00:04:06.840> or<00:04:06.870> six<00:04:07.320> rows<00:04:07.739> but<00:04:08.400> basically

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
about five or six rows but basically

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.880 
about five or six rows but basically
eyeball<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.690> see<00:04:09.989> what<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.350> like<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.799> if

eyeball it and see what you like and if

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.360 
eyeball it and see what you like and if
the<00:04:10.980> ends<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.459> want<00:04:11.730> kind<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.330> nice

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
the ends you want kind of like a nice

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.640 
the ends you want kind of like a nice
round<00:04:13.580> pattern<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.450> middle<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:15.230> can<00:04:15.260> even

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650
