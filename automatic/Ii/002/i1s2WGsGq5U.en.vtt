2 Zinda helped clarify something for me
that<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.430> needing<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:44.940> even<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.020> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that I was needing to know even if you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
that I was needing to know even if you
beat<00:00:46.440> map<00:00:46.680> 30<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.129> ultimate<00:00:47.550> doom<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.840> go

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
beat map 30 of ultimate doom if you go

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.130 
beat map 30 of ultimate doom if you go
into<00:00:49.079> map<00:00:49.260> 31<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.550> level<00:00:50.850> 31<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.809> starts

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
into map 31 or level 31 which starts

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
into map 31 or level 31 which starts
doom<00:00:52.350> -<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.190> still<00:00:53.520> lose<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> your

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
weaponry so it's kind of a pity but

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
weaponry so it's kind of a pity but
because<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> spirit<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> things

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
