00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.609
 we will continue this training 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.300
 on photoshop with a job that for 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.980
 the shot is going to be a little bit playful which 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.580
 will allow us to see a certain 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.750
 many new things 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.359
 what I 'm going to propose you to do in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.180
 done is to choose a picture then there 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.850
 I took an old picture of myself and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.830
 simply to make one 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.439
 caricature of making a caricature of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 this photo it will involve a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.990
 package of things actually only a pate a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.149
 package of skills already the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.700
 deformation in images we will see what 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.350
 it is that the trinity allows us 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.840
 also to learn to redraw an image 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 a pure a photo redraw someone 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 on a picture we will see a little bit 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 how does it allow us to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 see a little bit of the elements too 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 such as zoom-processed image 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 on the grain of an image because we 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 sees that frankly the image is of very 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.109
 poor quality I pray them expressly 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 low quality we will see a little bit 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.750
 all and all these elements there through to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.430
 through seven 7 this exercise is in the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.790
 first thing we're going to do here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 will of course be working on 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 the size of the image because here so 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.860
 I'm 100% what I'm going to do 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.060
 is that I'm going to increase the size of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.320
 my image so that's normally 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.909
 absolutely not to do since it's 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.140
 destructive that is to say that from the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.759
 when we increase the size of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.040
 images we will make appear 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.950
 artifacts of things in the image that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.439
 did not exist and who are who are going 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.799
 to be that they will degrade a little the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.420
 picture quality but we're going to the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.060
 to make sure that the picture already and not bad 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 degraded to true to its size to its 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 size here we're just not going 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.470
 to double the size of my image since 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.479
 there I am on an image that is 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.829
 relatively small we can see 800 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.380
 pixels by 533 pixels so I enlarge 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.110
 this picture relatively 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.960
 relatively important way for that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.030
 I am going in the image size of the image 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.220
 I'll put myself in percentage and I 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.149
 will say I want a size that is 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.239
 twice higher I click on ok this 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.300
 who will give me an image if we 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.360
 does not guarantee to be the image that makes 2600 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.330
 1066 that is that is going to be acceptable for 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.069
 power to be able to work on it 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.160
 that's good it was a very small aside 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.810
 for to precisely show this tool of 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.940
 image resizing the size of 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.400
 the image that is something of enough to 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.140
 these practices quite interesting to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.310
 use what we are going to do is that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.840
 from the next video we will 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.299
 really tackle the bottom of the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.519
 problem to know first problem the 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.260
 clipping here we had seen the clipping 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.630
 with geometric shapes how does that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.569
 happens when it's not a form 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.280
 geometric voice the video if I you 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.280
 pledges to go on the next video
