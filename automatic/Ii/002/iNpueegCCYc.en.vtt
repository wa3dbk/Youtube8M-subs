00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.060
 all welcome in this video clip I 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.060
 would make a non-freeze 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.130
 windshield cleaner for 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.180
 the car 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:22.080
 winter that's bought this fruit i concentration 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.970
 supermarket which says that in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 pure form 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.150
 stand cold to -60 degrees then 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.489
 there is as if the cold minus 60 is quite 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.489
 should up values ​​taken it should not 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.410
 freeze is a circuit we have the following 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 the manufacturer writes that we will liters 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.489
 count 2 liters hub we are 1 liter 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.820
 water and your liquid will not freeze at 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.660
 temperature up to minus thirty one liter 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 concentrate to 1 liter of water to minus 20 and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.070
 1 liter of concentrate to 2 liters of water to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.150
 I 'm probably thinning a liter here 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 one and a half liters and we will succeed somewhere 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 to -15 in principle, we have in Ukraine such 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.799
 frequent and prolonged cold does not happen 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.250
 what I think at -13 no one pays like me 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.250
 I will do it 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.090
 liter of concentrate i will pour into the bottle and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.340
 then just add some tap water 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.700
 war of course distilled water but 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.750
 since I didn't get my magic 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.580
 distilled will dilute simple 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.790
 water from the tap that is part of 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:53.590
 made us ethyl alcohol you 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.490
 varnished some kind of beer b more than 0 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.110
 5 percent flavoring dye and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:08.490
 distilled water is such a concentrate 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.490
 cost me 32-bit or is it somewhere 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:17.519
 roughly 4 dollars okay let's get started 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.819
 so I opened a bottle of concentrate and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.109
 will be it now 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.409
 I want to add our large capacity 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:36.829
 notice that the smell of course 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.829
 alcohol so take our capacity 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:49.280
 and begin to fill in this way 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.280
 it all happens 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:58.580
 undermines made and spirit 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.580
 1 how much it harms the gum 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.180
 so something rezinochka janitors drips 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 I can say I did not once a matter 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:21.780
 preparing to see what of it 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.780
 it will turn out yes for gone of course goes 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:33.060
 concrete glove concentrate 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.319
 and so on in order to smooth 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.720
 measure one and a half liters 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.230
 I'm right in this bottle of concentrate decline 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:50.430
 I added water from the tap first 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:55.080
 a liter and then a document and a half liters more 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.640
 bottle and I will 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:04.350
 liquids exactly two and a half liters 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:10.239
 liter of concentrate to half a liter of water 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:16.390
 which according to the instructions should be 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:19.560
 keep the frost down to minus 15 and pour 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.560
 last half liter 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.430
 by the way tell you alcohol it is not so 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:37.949
 the smell has gone into a matter of flavor light 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.949
 such a smell flavoring 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:48.779
 close this whole thing and shake it up 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.570
 mixed up that she's good not so much 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.910
 in the end we got two and a half 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.710
 liter of fluid which should 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.370
 withstand temperatures down to minus 15 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.520
 degrees and sweaters concentrate on 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:19.120
 which indicates 60 minutes we 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.790
 Got 20 of the world given the value given 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.490
