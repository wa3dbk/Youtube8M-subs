canvas<00:01:00.199> 3d<00:01:00.559> over<00:01:01.100> here<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.909> can<00:01:02.030> see<00:01:02.059> that

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
canvas 3d over here so you can see that

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.090 
canvas 3d over here so you can see that
you<00:01:02.539> have<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.809> micromax<00:01:03.199> a115<00:01:03.710> it's

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
you have the micromax a115 it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.160 
you have the micromax a115 it's
registered<00:01:04.790> over<00:01:04.970> here<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.900> can<00:01:06.020> take<00:01:06.140> a

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
registered over here so you can take a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.420 
registered over here so you can take a
look<00:01:06.320> at<00:01:06.410> that<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:06.710> also<00:01:06.830> have<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.070> CPU

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
look at that we also have the CPU

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.320 
look at that we also have the CPU
information<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:08.660> it's<00:01:08.810> an<00:01:08.870> arm<00:01:09.080> v7<00:01:09.350> processor

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
information so it's an arm v7 processor

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.580 
information so it's an arm v7 processor
you<00:01:11.330> can<00:01:11.360> look<00:01:11.570> at<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.720> frequency<00:01:11.990> number<00:01:12.500> of

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
you can look at the frequency number of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.730 
you can look at the frequency number of
course<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.250> it's<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.910> mediatek<00:01:14.300> mt6577<00:01:15.020> you

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
course and it's the mediatek mt6577 you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.120 
course and it's the mediatek mt6577 you
can<00:01:15.860> see<00:01:15.950> we<00:01:16.040> have<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.190> total<00:01:16.310> of<00:01:16.720> under<00:01:18.130> 512

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
can see we have a total of under 512

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.390 
can see we have a total of under 512
megabyte<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.090> RAM<00:01:20.480> so<00:01:20.990> in<00:01:21.590> terms<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:22.010> ram<00:01:22.220> the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
megabyte of RAM so in terms of ram the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.000 
megabyte of RAM so in terms of ram the
device<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.910> really<00:01:23.210> lacking<00:01:23.410> let's<00:01:24.410> jump<00:01:24.920> over

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
device is really lacking let's jump over

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.310 
device is really lacking let's jump over
the<00:01:25.340> displays<00:01:25.670> over<00:01:25.850> here<00:01:26.060> for<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.450> 80<00:01:26.660> x<00:01:26.870> 800

the displays over here for and 80 x 800

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.800 
the displays over here for and 80 x 800
pixel<00:01:27.620> resolution<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.670> can<00:01:28.820> see<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.780> is

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
pixel resolution you can see that it is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.000 
pixel resolution you can see that it is
the<00:01:30.080> power<00:01:30.230> we<00:01:30.500> are<00:01:30.620> sgx<00:01:31.190> 531<00:01:31.880> GPU<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:33.410> if<00:01:33.920> we

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
the power we are sgx 531 GPU and if we

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.560 
the power we are sgx 531 GPU and if we
jump<00:01:34.190> over<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.430> sense<00:01:34.820> as<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.120> can<00:01:35.240> see<00:01:35.420> we

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
jump over to sense as you can see we

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.300 
jump over to sense as you can see we
have<00:01:35.600> an<00:01:35.780> orientation<00:01:35.900> sensor<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.800> magnetic

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
have an orientation sensor a magnetic

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.790 
have an orientation sensor a magnetic

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
sensor and a light sensor and that's it

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.050 
sensor and a light sensor and that's it
for<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.830> sensors<00:01:43.370> we're<00:01:43.760> going<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:43.940> run

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
for the sensors we're going to run

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.820 
for the sensors we're going to run
benchmarks<00:01:44.330> on<00:01:44.930> both<00:01:45.320> these<00:01:45.500> devices

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
benchmarks on both these devices

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.190 
benchmarks on both these devices
together<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.580> let's<00:01:47.000> run<00:01:47.240> full<00:01:47.660> bench<00:01:47.870> marks

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
together so let's run full bench marks

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:05.160 
together so let's run full bench marks
on<00:01:48.350> both<00:01:48.560> these

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.390 

so<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.260> can<00:02:06.500> see<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.950> canvas<00:02:07.280> HD

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
so you can see that the canvas HD

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.389 
so you can see that the canvas HD
finished<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.970> long<00:02:08.300> time<00:02:08.360> ago<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:09.500> the

finished a long time ago and the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.830 
finished a long time ago and the
difference<00:02:10.700> between<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.060> device<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.569> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
difference between the device is the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.720 
difference between the device is the
canvas<00:02:12.200> HD<00:02:12.530> scores<00:02:13.069> over<00:02:14.050> 3600<00:02:15.050> it's<00:02:15.200> about

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
canvas HD scores over 3600 it's about

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.910 
canvas HD scores over 3600 it's about
3696<00:02:16.730> around<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.720> canvas<00:02:17.900> HD<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.680> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
3696 around the canvas HD and on the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.710 
3696 around the canvas HD and on the
canvas<00:02:19.250> 3d<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:20.140> 2966<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.500> about<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> thousand

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
canvas 3d it's 2966 so about a thousand

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.150 
canvas 3d it's 2966 so about a thousand
difference<00:02:23.720> less<00:02:24.260> than<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.440> thousand<00:02:24.800> actually

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
difference less than a thousand actually

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.030 
difference less than a thousand actually
we<00:02:25.310> have<00:02:25.430> about<00:02:25.700> 700<00:02:26.680> point<00:02:27.680> difference

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
we have about 700 point difference

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.610 
we have about 700 point difference
between<00:02:28.370> both<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.700> devices<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:30.110> canvas<00:02:30.319> HD

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620

2074<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.530> let's<00:02:46.010> take<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.220> look<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.430> Nina<00:02:46.700> mark

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
2074 so let's take a look at Nina mark

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.640 
2074 so let's take a look at Nina mark
now<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.450> since<00:02:47.959> both<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.980> devices<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:50.650> good

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
now and since both the devices have good

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.670 
now and since both the devices have good
graphics<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:53.330> feel<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.750> an<00:02:53.989> enum<00:02:54.319> work<00:02:54.500> too

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
graphics we feel that an enum work too

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.610 
graphics we feel that an enum work too
should<00:02:54.950> run<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.459> other<00:02:55.910> canvas<00:02:56.390> 3d<00:02:56.870> almost

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
should run on other canvas 3d almost

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.220 
should run on other canvas 3d almost
equally<00:02:57.980> as<00:02:58.220> nice<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.910> did<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.900> canvas

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
equally as nice as it did on the canvas

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:31.030 
equally as nice as it did on the canvas
HD<00:03:03.069> let<00:03:04.069> me<00:03:04.190> quick

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.740 

so<00:03:32.040> as<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.190> probably<00:03:32.519> saw<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.910> canvas<00:03:33.510> 3d

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so as you probably saw the canvas 3d

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.809 
so as you probably saw the canvas 3d
really<00:03:34.260> struggled<00:03:34.709> through<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.160> only<00:03:35.489> a

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
really struggled through that only a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.839 
really struggled through that only a
score<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.739> 23.9<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.489> lot<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> lag<00:03:39.390> lot<00:03:39.930> of

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
score of 23.9 a lot of lag lot of

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.550 
score of 23.9 a lot of lag lot of
pixilation<00:03:41.849> while<00:03:42.360> trying<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.080> run<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.230> test

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
pixilation while trying to run the test

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.660 
pixilation while trying to run the test
so<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.640> far<00:03:44.880> as<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.239> are<00:03:45.269> concerned<00:03:45.360> as<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.349> now

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
so as far as we are concerned as of now

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.600 
so as far as we are concerned as of now
the<00:03:47.670> canvas<00:03:48.030> HD<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.540> far<00:03:48.780> superior<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
the canvas HD is far superior to the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.520 
the canvas HD is far superior to the
canvas<00:03:50.790> 3d<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.420> terms<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.780> performance<00:03:51.959> and

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
canvas 3d in terms of performance and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.190 
canvas 3d in terms of performance and
that<00:03:53.430> seems<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.269> result<00:03:54.840> right<00:03:54.900> now

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
that seems to be this result right now

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.289 
that seems to be this result right now
let's<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.799> into<00:03:56.040> an<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.150> will<00:03:57.239> be

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
let's go into an to do and that will be

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.820 
let's go into an to do and that will be
our<00:03:57.330> final<00:03:57.780> benchmark<00:03:58.230> for<00:03:58.290> these<00:03:58.500> devices

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
our final benchmark for these devices

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.670 
our final benchmark for these devices
and<00:03:59.190> we<00:04:00.030> will<00:04:00.120> run<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.420> full<00:04:00.599> benchmark<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.530> can

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and we will run a full benchmark you can

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.530 
and we will run a full benchmark you can
see<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.920> previous<00:04:02.220> result<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:03.000> canvas<00:04:03.360> HD

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
see the previous result on the canvas HD

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.430 
see the previous result on the canvas HD
12<00:04:03.989> 8<00:04:04.769> 31<00:04:05.280> which<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> really<00:04:06.690> nice<00:04:06.810> score<00:04:07.140> for

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
12 8 31 which is a really nice score for

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:36.370 
12 8 31 which is a really nice score for
a<00:04:07.680> device's<00:04:08.099> this<00:04:08.250> value<00:04:08.610> amazon

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.570 

so<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.410> don't<00:04:37.590> know<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:37.890> guys<00:04:38.010> can<00:04:38.190> see<00:04:38.220> that

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
so I don't know if you guys can see that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.220 
so I don't know if you guys can see that
but<00:04:38.730> that's<00:04:38.940> almost<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.660> hundred<00:04:39.960> percent

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
but that's almost a hundred percent

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.710 
but that's almost a hundred percent
difference<00:04:40.590> between<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.280> canvas<00:04:41.610> 3d<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
difference between the canvas 3d and the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
766 and the canvas 3d scores a 64 16

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.200 
766 and the canvas 3d scores a 64 16
almost<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.910> complete<00:04:51.890> double<00:04:52.890> score<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.850> as<00:04:54.150> far

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
almost a complete double score so as far

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.360 
almost a complete double score so as far
as<00:04:54.420> we're<00:04:54.720> concerned<00:04:54.750> guys<00:04:55.350> I<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:56.010> can<00:04:56.190> take<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
as we're concerned guys I you can take a

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.740 
as we're concerned guys I you can take a
look<00:04:56.460> at<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.670> destiny<00:04:57.000> results<00:04:57.330> over<00:04:57.480> here<00:04:57.630> or

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
look at the destiny results over here or

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.820 
look at the destiny results over here or

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
as we are concerned guys the devices

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.110 
as we are concerned guys the devices

these devices will get you almost a

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.900 
these devices will get you almost a
double<00:05:18.630> performer<00:05:19.140> in<00:05:19.890> terms<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.280> graphics<00:05:20.520> in

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
double performer in terms of graphics in

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.910 
double performer in terms of graphics in
terms<00:05:21.240> of<00:05:21.450> total<00:05:21.660> benchmarks<00:05:22.350> in<00:05:22.500> terms<00:05:22.740> of

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
terms of total benchmarks in terms of

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.370 
terms of total benchmarks in terms of
total<00:05:23.100> usability<00:05:23.820> we<00:05:24.030> have<00:05:24.210> more<00:05:24.870> performance

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
total usability we have more performance

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.100 
total usability we have more performance
from<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.740> canvas<00:05:26.040> HD<00:05:26.450> just<00:05:27.450> by<00:05:27.630> spending<00:05:27.870> a

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
from the canvas HD just by spending a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.020 
from the canvas HD just by spending a
price<00:05:28.290> difference<00:05:28.470> about<00:05:28.830> 3,000<00:05:29.430> 3,500

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
price difference about 3,000 3,500

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.860 
price difference about 3,000 3,500
rupees<00:05:30.660> so<00:05:31.560> that's<00:05:32.100> in<00:05:32.850> terms<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.240> benchmarks

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
rupees so that's in terms of benchmarks

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.120 
rupees so that's in terms of benchmarks
so<00:05:34.020> I'm<00:05:34.140> also<00:05:34.290> going<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.500> do<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.620> multi-touch

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
so I'm also going to do a multi-touch

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.210 
so I'm also going to do a multi-touch
test<00:05:35.460> on<00:05:35.730> our<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.210> canvas<00:05:36.600> 3d<00:05:36.750> over<00:05:37.230> here<00:05:37.380> so

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
test on our the canvas 3d over here so

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.860 
test on our the canvas 3d over here so
that<00:05:38.400> we<00:05:38.430> can<00:05:38.700> get<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:39.060> also<00:05:39.480> however<00:05:39.750> the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
that we can get that also however the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.409 
that we can get that also however the
way

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.999 

so<00:05:48.419> yeah<00:05:48.659> the<00:05:48.869> screen<00:05:49.110> is<00:05:49.259> only<00:05:49.379> four<00:05:49.739> point

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
so yeah the screen is only four point

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.359 
so yeah the screen is only four point
touch<00:05:50.339> which<00:05:51.209> is<00:05:51.389> also<00:05:51.889> again<00:05:52.889> slightly

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:53.369 
touch which is also again slightly

00:05:53.369 --> 00:06:06.309 
touch which is also again slightly
disappointing<00:05:54.179> for<00:05:54.360> us<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:55.110> canvas<00:05:55.589> HD

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.409 

the<00:06:07.319> canvas<00:06:07.560> HD<00:06:07.860> has<00:06:08.220> five<00:06:08.460> points<00:06:08.729> whereas

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
the canvas HD has five points whereas

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.869 
the canvas HD has five points whereas
the<00:06:09.629> canvas<00:06:10.139> 3d<00:06:10.349> has<00:06:10.740> four<00:06:10.979> points<00:06:11.340> so<00:06:11.490> quite<00:06:11.849> a

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
the canvas 3d has four points so quite a

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.240 
the canvas 3d has four points so quite a
bit<00:06:12.120> of<00:06:12.210> difference<00:06:12.330> in<00:06:12.690> terms<00:06:12.960> of<00:06:13.250> multi

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
bit of difference in terms of multi

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.399 
bit of difference in terms of multi
touch<00:06:14.400> points<00:06:14.849> as<00:06:15.000> well<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:16.169> there<00:06:16.319> you<00:06:16.379> go

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
touch points as well so there you go

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.020 
touch points as well so there you go
guys<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:17.099> was<00:06:17.250> our<00:06:17.490> result<00:06:17.789> of<00:06:17.940> the
