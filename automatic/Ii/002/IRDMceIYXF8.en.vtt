00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.130 
the code would would wear off as well so
you<00:01:53.909> scratch<00:01:54.180> off<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> could<00:01:54.840> barely

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you scratch off and you could barely

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
you scratch off and you could barely
read<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> fortunately<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.610> me<00:01:56.640> when<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
read it fortunately for me when it

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
read it fortunately for me when it
happened<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.450> i<00:01:57.479> managed<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> figure<00:01:58.200> out

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
happened to me i managed to figure out

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.450 
happened to me i managed to figure out
what<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> code<00:01:58.710> said<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.189> they<00:01:59.280> won't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
what the code said because they won't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
what the code said because they won't
give<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> refund<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.689> most<00:02:01.320> places<00:02:01.500> started

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
give you a refund so most places started

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.560 
give you a refund so most places started
doing<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.520> way<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.909> way<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.420> just

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
doing it this way that way you can just

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.980 
doing it this way that way you can just
peel<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.810> off<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.079> away<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.960> is

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
peel it off and away you go so this is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.550 
peel it off and away you go so this is

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
never really looked too far into this so

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.759 
never really looked too far into this so
I<00:02:44.549> don't<00:02:44.730> even<00:02:44.790> know<00:02:44.939> what<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.180> about<00:02:45.239> but

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
I don't even know what it's about but

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.399 
I don't even know what it's about but
basically<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:48.090> thing<00:02:48.389> is<00:02:48.659> saying<00:02:49.019> if<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
basically this thing is saying if you

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.140 
basically this thing is saying if you
activate<00:02:49.889> your<00:02:49.950> past<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.609> think<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:50.939> an

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
activate your past I think this is an

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.789 
activate your past I think this is an
all<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.299> think<00:02:51.629> you<00:02:51.720> need<00:02:51.840> an<00:02:51.959> online<00:02:52.049> pass<00:02:52.560> with

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
all I think you need an online pass with

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.610 
all I think you need an online pass with
this<00:02:52.919> game<00:02:53.159> which<00:02:53.879> is<00:02:54.000> pretty<00:02:54.419> stupid<00:02:55.049> yeah

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
this game which is pretty stupid yeah

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.319 
this game which is pretty stupid yeah
cuz<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:56.010> fee<00:02:56.189> or<00:02:56.280> three<00:02:56.459> passcode<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
cuz the fee or three passcode is on the

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.780 
cuz the fee or three passcode is on the
back<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.139> you<00:02:58.919> get<00:02:59.159> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
back that you can see it you get to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
back that you can see it you get to
exclusive<00:03:00.689> multiplayer<00:03:01.260> modes<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.129> not

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
exclusive multiplayer modes so not

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.210 
exclusive multiplayer modes so not
matched<00:03:02.519> with<00:03:02.790> modes<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.989> i'll<00:03:04.739> definitely

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
matched with modes so i'll definitely

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.309 
matched with modes so i'll definitely
want<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.430> find<00:03:05.609> out<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:05.939> those<00:03:06.150> are<00:03:06.510> but

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.659 
definitely pretty neat i like the thing
is<00:03:09.629> with<00:03:09.930> these<00:03:10.109> games<00:03:10.439> man<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:10.980> got<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> pretty

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
is with these games man you got a pretty

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.270 
is with these games man you got a pretty
much<00:03:11.879> buy<00:03:12.209> them<00:03:12.510> new<00:03:12.989> or<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.799> want<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.099> one

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
much buy them new or you want get one

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.240 
much buy them new or you want get one
get<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> code<00:03:14.760> because<00:03:14.970> i'm<00:03:15.060> pretty<00:03:15.269> sure

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
get the code because i'm pretty sure

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.819 
get the code because i'm pretty sure
that<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.400> actually<00:03:17.790> cheaper<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:19.650> buy<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
that it's actually cheaper to buy the

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.949 
that it's actually cheaper to buy the
game<00:03:20.129> then<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:20.579> like<00:03:20.909> by<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.389> game<00:03:21.690> later

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
game then then like by the game later

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.629 
game then then like by the game later
when<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.680> don't<00:03:22.859> ship<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.400> anymore

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
when they don't ship it with it anymore

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.569 
when they don't ship it with it anymore
and<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.479> have<00:03:25.199> to<00:03:25.379> go<00:03:25.409> online<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.069> use<00:03:26.250> by

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
and then have to go online and use by

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.640 
and then have to go online and use by
the<00:03:26.639> code<00:03:26.970> through<00:03:27.419> xbox<00:03:28.139> live<00:03:28.349> with<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the code through xbox live with the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.319 
the code through xbox live with the
PlayStation<00:03:29.129> Store<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.090> pretty<00:03:30.209> sure

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
PlayStation Store so I'm pretty sure

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.539 
PlayStation Store so I'm pretty sure
it's<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> better<00:03:30.690> idea<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.019> do<00:03:31.139> that<00:03:31.169> but<00:03:31.650> you

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it's a better idea to do that but you

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.610 
it's a better idea to do that but you
never<00:03:32.729> know<00:03:32.940> now<00:03:33.659> also<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.169> the<00:03:34.319> back<00:03:34.440> there's

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
never know now also on the back there's
