00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.149
 Serbian who wanted 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.450
 a lot of time the guys 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.820
 You're seeing the series is full. 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.590
 I think I think the engine and I go 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.060
 show that now some home that has the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.460
 puff and shirt 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.490
 good guys as you already know these 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.260
 The fg of the table are always kind alike and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.970
 with the same goal you already know 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.480
 now need to explain 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.880
 It is there that they stay in the middle is the king of 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.890
 table that starts and who stays inside 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.780
 of these booths are the books that go 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.150
 fight the king of the nisa 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.030
 If you win the king of the table you 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.750
 will make the king of the table so and who 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.310

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.560

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.739
 here is if you do a very brief 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.720
 fast you can not do 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:23.600

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:25.550
 op 33 got the team right at 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.610
 Sometimes they are not friends, they want to make a 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.500
 time here on crt pt 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.750
 but you also do not have to exaggerate in the face 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.450
 that you get where you go alone in the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.770
 One face tap but already if you do not 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.770
