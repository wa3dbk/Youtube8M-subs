opportunity<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.230> line<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> quick<00:00:37.890> headshot

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
opportunity to line up a quick headshot

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.590 
opportunity to line up a quick headshot
to<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> veteran<00:00:39.030> challenges<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
to get the veteran challenges and
everything<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.469> figured<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.250> mayor's<00:00:41.489> or

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
everything so I figured as mayor's or

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.010 
everything so I figured as mayor's or
just<00:00:41.850> line<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.180> head<00:00:42.329> shot<00:00:42.540> instead<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> just

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
just line up a head shot instead of just

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.779 
just line up a head shot instead of just
getting<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.379> quick<00:00:43.559> scope<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.040> no<00:00:44.129> reason<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
getting a quick scope for no reason and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
getting a quick scope for no reason and
someone<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.300> moving<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:47.780> could<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> guy

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
someone not moving I could see that guy

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
someone not moving I could see that guy
on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> UAV<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:50.489> he<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.730> killed

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
on the UAV because he just killed

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
on the UAV because he just killed
someone<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.570> didn't<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.710> him<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> kill

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
someone I didn't really want him to kill

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.850 
someone I didn't really want him to kill
me<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.730> went<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.030> finished<00:00:54.180> him<00:00:54.420> off

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
me so I just went and finished him off

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.029 
me so I just went and finished him off
normally<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.800> when

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
normally and a good thing to do when

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.439 
normally and a good thing to do when
you're<00:00:59.160> quick<00:00:59.340> scoping<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> move<00:01:00.149> from

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
you're quick scoping is to move from

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.380 
you're quick scoping is to move from
cover<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> cover<00:01:01.190> because<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> major

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
cover to cover because you're a major

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.469 
cover to cover because you're a major
disadvantage<00:01:03.870> even<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.860> you're<00:01:04.979> good<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
disadvantage even if you're good at it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.149 
disadvantage even if you're good at it
you<00:01:06.479> still<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> major<00:01:07.200> disadvantage<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you still at a major disadvantage to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.820 
you still at a major disadvantage to
everyone<00:01:08.490> else<00:01:08.700> playing<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.530> good<00:01:10.680> way

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
everyone else playing so it's a good way

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.330 
everyone else playing so it's a good way
to<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.490> keep<00:01:12.390> behind<00:01:12.750> cover<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to just keep behind cover when you can

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.480 
to just keep behind cover when you can
because<00:01:15.330> you're<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.470> easy<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.830> pick<00:01:17.070> off<00:01:17.250> when

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
because you're so easy to pick off when

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.070 
because you're so easy to pick off when
you're<00:01:17.580> quick<00:01:17.759> scoping<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.390> unbelievable

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you're quick scoping it's unbelievable

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.580 
you're quick scoping it's unbelievable
and<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.159> die<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.000> easily<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.409> guy

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and you can die so easily and that guy

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.960 
and you can die so easily and that guy
couldn't<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> good<00:01:23.430> view<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.759> him

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
couldn't really get a good view on him

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
couldn't really get a good view on him
from<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.720> waited<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.049> him<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
from there so I just waited for him to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
from there so I just waited for him to
come<00:01:25.320> round<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.549> got<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.850> easy<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
come round and just got an easy to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.219 
come round and just got an easy to
quickscope<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:29.750> since<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> point<00:01:31.110> i

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
quickscope on in there since the point i

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.660 
quickscope on in there since the point i
think<00:01:31.259> i've<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.619> five<00:01:31.829> people<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.369> round

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
think i've got five people that round

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.890 
think i've got five people that round
which<00:01:33.240> isn't<00:01:33.600> too<00:01:33.720> bad<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.470> round

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
which isn't too bad for just one round

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.469 
which isn't too bad for just one round
this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.140> kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> last<00:01:37.890> game<00:01:38.159> up

this is kind of like the last game up

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
this is kind of like the last game up

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
everything again which is really

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.890 
everything again which is really
annoying<00:02:16.910> because<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.300> actually<00:02:17.450> had<00:02:17.720> quite<00:02:17.810> a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
annoying because I actually had quite a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.160 
annoying because I actually had quite a
lot<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.200> save<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:19.240> killed<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.600> hit<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:20.990> guy

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
lot of save I killed this I hit this guy

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.630 
lot of save I killed this I hit this guy
here<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.530> he<00:02:21.590> falls<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.920> his<00:02:22.040> death<00:02:22.100> while<00:02:22.610> I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
here and he falls to his death while I

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.060 
here and he falls to his death while I
try<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.030> shoot<00:02:23.210> for<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.540> wall<00:02:23.720> which<00:02:24.710> kind<00:02:24.980> of

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
try and shoot for the wall which kind of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.460 
try and shoot for the wall which kind of
ruined<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.430> killcam<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.210> honest<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
ruined the killcam to be honest but it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.840 
ruined the killcam to be honest but it
would<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.740> looked<00:02:28.010> quite<00:02:28.250> nice<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.640> showed

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
would have looked quite nice it showed

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.280 
would have looked quite nice it showed
the<00:02:28.880> first<00:02:29.210> guy<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:29.690> him<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:29.990> he<00:02:30.080> didn't

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the first guy and then him if he didn't

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.500 
the first guy and then him if he didn't
hit<00:02:30.380> marker<00:02:36.940> especially<00:02:37.940> annoying<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
hit marker especially annoying on the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.450 
hit marker especially annoying on the
last<00:02:38.690> run<00:02:38.960> because<00:02:39.320> i<00:02:39.500> had<00:02:39.650> hereos<00:02:40.100> off<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
last run because i had hereos off and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.890 
last run because i had hereos off and
everything<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.270> i<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
everything and this i think this is the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.070 
everything and this i think this is the
last<00:02:42.050> round<00:02:42.350> here<00:02:42.620> now<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:44.150> 820<00:02:44.870> at<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
last round here now and I'm 820 at the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.620 
last round here now and I'm 820 at the
moment<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.640> called<00:02:46.880> him<00:02:46.970> my<00:02:47.090> hereos<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
moment and I called him my hereos and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.980 
moment and I called him my hereos and
everything<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.230> my<00:02:49.040> internet<00:02:50.000> disconnects<00:02:50.720> I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
everything and my internet disconnects I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.500 
everything and my internet disconnects I
think<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.260> get<00:02:51.470> two<00:02:51.770> kills<00:02:52.130> this<00:02:52.310> round<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:53.360> my

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
think I get two kills this round was my

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.910 
think I get two kills this round was my
sniper<00:02:53.780> i'm<00:02:53.960> not<00:02:54.110> sure<00:02:54.200> if<00:02:54.290> my<00:02:54.410> Harriers<00:02:54.770> get

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
sniper i'm not sure if my Harriers get

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.810 
sniper i'm not sure if my Harriers get
any<00:02:55.100> kills<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.520> not<00:02:55.990> but<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.580> really

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
any kills or not but it was really

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.610 
any kills or not but it was really
annoying<00:02:59.180> when<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.540> happened<00:02:59.900> because<00:03:00.110> this

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
annoying when it happened because this

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.230 
annoying when it happened because this
game<00:03:01.070> paid<00:03:01.340> looked<00:03:01.670> like<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.880> was<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.150> be

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
game paid looked like it was going to be

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.450 
game paid looked like it was going to be
a<00:03:02.270> really<00:03:02.450> good<00:03:02.660> gameplay<00:03:03.110> in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> end<00:03:03.500> but

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
a really good gameplay in the end but

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.480 
a really good gameplay in the end but
then<00:03:05.390> my<00:03:06.200> internet<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:06.710> had<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.010> disconnect

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
then my internet just had to disconnect

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.100 
then my internet just had to disconnect
so<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:07.850> just<00:03:08.030> get<00:03:08.180> really<00:03:08.210> easy<00:03:08.570> head<00:03:08.810> shot<00:03:08.990> on

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
so I just get really easy head shot on

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.780 
so I just get really easy head shot on
him<00:03:09.290> come<00:03:10.040> around<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.310> try<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:10.580> get<00:03:10.700> this

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790

out my teammate i'm a connection then

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.790 
out my teammate i'm a connection then
times<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:26.240> which<00:03:26.630> was<00:03:26.840> really<00:03:27.350> annoying<00:03:27.590> at

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
the time but i guess it was still quite

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.630 
the time but i guess it was still quite
a<00:03:30.170> nice<00:03:30.350> game<00:03:30.590> fair<00:03:30.830> anyway<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:31.340> just
