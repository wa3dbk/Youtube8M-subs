looking<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.999> just<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:58.989> first<00:00:59.230> one<00:00:59.379> I've

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499

done<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.100> very<00:01:00.969> proud<00:01:01.179> of<00:01:01.239> myself<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.989> didn't

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
done so very proud of myself I didn't

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.690 
done so very proud of myself I didn't
think<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:02.890> would<00:01:02.980> turn<00:01:03.159> out<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:03.339> well<00:01:03.699> so<00:01:04.690> i

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
think it would turn out this well so i

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320 
think it would turn out this well so i
think<00:01:06.700> i<00:01:06.970> might<00:01:07.180> start<00:01:07.480> taking<00:01:07.930> off<00:01:09.330> projects

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330

think i might start taking off projects
