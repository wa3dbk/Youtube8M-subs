00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:02.780 
so we've had some concern with the rear

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.410 
so we've had some concern with the rear
brake<00:00:03.430> adjusting<00:00:04.430> so<00:00:05.000> I'm<00:00:05.060> going<00:00:05.180> to<00:00:05.210> show

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
brake adjusting so I'm going to show

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.329 
brake adjusting so I'm going to show
real<00:00:05.690> quick<00:00:05.720> what<00:00:06.200> you<00:00:06.319> need<00:00:06.500> to<00:00:06.620> do<00:00:06.799> to<00:00:06.830> adjust

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:07.339 
real quick what you need to do to adjust

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.089 
real quick what you need to do to adjust
the<00:00:07.399> rear<00:00:07.609> brakes<00:00:08.110> the<00:00:09.110> key<00:00:09.380> here<00:00:09.710> on<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:09.950> rear

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
the rear brakes the key here on the rear

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.669 
the rear brakes the key here on the rear
brakes<00:00:10.370> is<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:10.730> have<00:00:10.940> this<00:00:11.510> rod<00:00:14.019> stop<00:00:15.019> against

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
brakes is to have this rod stop against

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.550 
brakes is to have this rod stop against
here<00:00:16.040> so<00:00:16.340> that<00:00:16.490> literally<00:00:16.850> there<00:00:17.449> is<00:00:17.720> no<00:00:18.230> play

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
here so that literally there is no play

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.450 
here so that literally there is no play
there<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:20.420> brake<00:00:20.720> drum<00:00:21.080> arm<00:00:21.470> cannot

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
there so that the brake drum arm cannot

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.890 
there so that the brake drum arm cannot
swing<00:00:22.850> back<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.449> this<00:00:23.930> has<00:00:24.170> been<00:00:24.289> preloaded

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
swing back and this has been preloaded

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.019 
swing back and this has been preloaded
real<00:00:26.900> tight<00:00:27.199> against<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.710> drum<00:00:28.039> so<00:00:28.699> when<00:00:28.939> you

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
real tight against the drum so when you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.570 
real tight against the drum so when you
first<00:00:29.300> put<00:00:29.539> your<00:00:29.689> break<00:00:29.929> armaan<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:30.769> take<00:00:31.400> off

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
first put your break armaan I take off

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.010 
first put your break armaan I take off
the<00:00:31.730> spring<00:00:32.029> sometimes<00:00:32.480> it<00:00:32.719> makes<00:00:32.870> this

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
the spring sometimes it makes this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.569 
the spring sometimes it makes this
process<00:00:33.469> a<00:00:33.739> little<00:00:33.860> bit<00:00:33.980> easier<00:00:34.219> because<00:00:34.489> you

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
process a little bit easier because you

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.010 
process a little bit easier because you
don't<00:00:34.820> end<00:00:34.969> up<00:00:35.030> really<00:00:35.210> needing<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.690> return

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
don't end up really needing the return

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.040 
don't end up really needing the return
spring<00:00:36.200> here<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.550> this<00:00:37.700> arm<00:00:38.059> you're<00:00:38.809> going<00:00:38.840> to

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
spring here so this arm you're going to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.930 
spring here so this arm you're going to
start<00:00:39.350> by<00:00:39.620> when<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:39.950> put<00:00:40.160> it<00:00:40.250> on<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:40.610> spline

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
start by when you put it on the spline

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.630 
start by when you put it on the spline
start<00:00:41.480> at<00:00:41.600> about<00:00:41.719> an<00:00:42.590> eight<00:00:42.829> o'clock<00:00:42.890> position

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
start at about an eight o'clock position

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.790 
start at about an eight o'clock position
and<00:00:43.850> pre-loaded<00:00:44.600> down<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:45.170> here<00:00:45.500> at<00:00:45.590> about<00:00:45.680> a

and pre-loaded down to here at about a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.010 
and pre-loaded down to here at about a
seven<00:00:46.039> o'clock<00:00:46.280> position<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:47.510> stick<00:00:47.899> it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
seven o'clock position so you stick it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.119 
seven o'clock position so you stick it
on<00:00:48.370> tighten<00:00:49.370> up<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.610> slack<00:00:49.910> in<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.270> drum<00:00:51.129> with

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
on tighten up the slack in the drum with

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.520 
on tighten up the slack in the drum with
the<00:00:52.610> rod<00:00:52.820> in<00:00:53.090> place<00:00:53.360> if<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:54.199> do<00:00:54.350> that

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
the rod in place if you do that

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.060 
the rod in place if you do that
correctly<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:56.449> rod<00:00:56.690> no<00:00:57.050> longer<00:00:57.469> has<00:00:57.680> any

correctly the rod no longer has any

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.880 
correctly the rod no longer has any
return<00:00:58.609> pressure<00:00:59.079> it<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:00.350> has<00:01:00.530> downward

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
return pressure it just has downward

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.470 
return pressure it just has downward
pressure<00:01:01.370> because<00:01:01.640> you're<00:01:01.789> basically<00:01:02.239> going

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
pressure because you're basically going

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.259 
pressure because you're basically going
to<00:01:02.600> be<00:01:02.690> hooking<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:03.289> this<00:01:03.469> rod<00:01:03.829> up<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.280> you're

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
to be hooking it this rod up and you're

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.929 
to be hooking it this rod up and you're
going<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.420> be<00:01:05.540> pulling<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.290> rod<00:01:06.470> up<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.820> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
bike put the pin in and it will keep the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.469

rear set from returning up and when it's
all<00:01:20.570> said<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:20.810> done<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.170> should<00:01:21.200> only<00:01:21.560> have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
all said and done you should only have

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.850 
all said and done you should only have
maybe<00:01:27.250> like<00:01:28.689> an<00:01:29.689> eighth<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.320> an<00:01:30.590> inch<00:01:30.680> of

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
maybe like an eighth of an inch of

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.370 
maybe like an eighth of an inch of
travel<00:01:32.170> on<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:34.250> drum<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.150> would<00:01:35.270> seems<00:01:36.200> like

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
travel on the drum you would seems like

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.600 
travel on the drum you would seems like
it<00:01:36.500> would<00:01:36.560> be<00:01:36.619> riding<00:01:37.009> on<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.159> drum<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:37.520> it

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
it would be riding on the drum but it

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.960 
it would be riding on the drum but it
doesn't<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.119> brake<00:01:38.329> shoes<00:01:38.659> actually<00:01:39.970> will

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
doesn't the brake shoes actually will

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.270 
doesn't the brake shoes actually will
roll<00:01:41.299> smoothly<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.990> drum<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.009> firms

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
roll smoothly on the drum and it firms

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.010 
roll smoothly on the drum and it firms
up<00:01:43.460> everything<00:01:43.850> in<00:01:43.939> place<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.750> do<00:01:44.899> it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
up everything in place and if you do it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.740 
up everything in place and if you do it
correctly<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.500> rear<00:01:45.710> brakes<00:01:46.100> will<00:01:46.340> lock<00:01:46.369> up

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
correctly the rear brakes will lock up

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.069 
correctly the rear brakes will lock up
very<00:01:47.750> solid<00:01:48.759> this<00:01:49.759> angle<00:01:50.390> here<00:01:50.689> should<00:01:50.960> be

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
very solid this angle here should be

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.370 
very solid this angle here should be
slightly<00:01:51.320> up<00:01:52.149> slightly<00:01:53.149> up<00:01:53.450> as<00:01:53.780> i'm<00:01:53.990> showing

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
slightly up slightly up as i'm showing

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.060 
slightly up slightly up as i'm showing
here<00:01:55.149> so<00:01:56.149> that<00:01:56.360> all<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> pressure<00:01:57.079> on<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
here so that all the pressure on the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.249 
here so that all the pressure on the
rear<00:01:59.590> it<00:02:00.670> has<00:02:01.670> no<00:02:01.909> way<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.659> return<00:02:02.990> back

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
rear it has no way to return back

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.690 
rear it has no way to return back
because<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:05.140> stopped<00:02:06.140> against<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.799> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
because it's stopped against that the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.059 
because it's stopped against that the
rod<00:02:07.939> has<00:02:08.269> stopped<00:02:08.479> against<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.929> lever<00:02:09.110> arm

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
rod has stopped against the lever arm

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.550 
rod has stopped against the lever arm
so<00:02:10.729> if<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:10.969> stopped<00:02:11.269> it<00:02:11.540> won't<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:12.349> back

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
so if it stopped it won't go back

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.289 
so if it stopped it won't go back
therefore<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.489> won't<00:02:13.609> pull<00:02:13.939> your<00:02:14.090> rear<00:02:14.269> set

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
therefore it won't pull your rear set

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:20.439 
therefore it won't pull your rear set
back<00:02:14.749> and<00:02:15.079> up<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.510> here's<00:02:17.719> overall<00:02:18.260> position
