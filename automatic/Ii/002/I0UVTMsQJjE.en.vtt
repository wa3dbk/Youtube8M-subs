00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
but in the end I just couldn't quite get

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
used to the smaller keys that was a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.810 
used to the smaller keys that was a
little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.570> difficulty<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.199> me<00:00:52.590> when<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
little bit of a difficulty for me when I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.549 
little bit of a difficulty for me when I
felt<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.510> ever<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.989> subtly<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
felt I just like ever so subtly the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
felt I just like ever so subtly the
keyboard<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.699> maybe<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
keyboard was and maybe it was just

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
keyboard was and maybe it was just
because<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> G<00:00:58.050> keys<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> side<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
because of the G keys to the side that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
because of the G keys to the side that
was<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> little<00:00:59.550> bit<00:01:00.289> not<00:01:01.289> able<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.010> use

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
was a little bit not able to get to use

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600 
was a little bit not able to get to use
to<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> angle<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> type<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> overall

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to the angle of the type so overall

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
to the angle of the type so overall
though<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.600> enjoyed<00:01:06.930> working<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
though I really enjoyed working with the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
though I really enjoyed working with the
keyboard<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> playing<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> couple

actually<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:57.000> thinking<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.360> keyboard<00:01:57.719> was

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
actually I was thinking the keyboard was

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
actually I was thinking the keyboard was
going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.380> large<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.890> overall<00:01:59.189> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
going to be really large but overall it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
going to be really large but overall it
was<00:01:59.640> pretty<00:01:59.909> typical<00:02:00.600> size<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> normal

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
was pretty typical size for a normal

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980 
was pretty typical size for a normal
keyboard<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.119> may<00:02:03.329> explain<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.810> little

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
keyboard and that may explain a little

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.149 
keyboard and that may explain a little
bit<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> smaller<00:02:05.340> keys

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
bit of the smaller keys

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.619 
bit of the smaller keys
really<00:02:07.520> providing<00:02:07.999> that<00:02:08.090> ability<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.479> have<00:02:08.599> a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
really providing that ability to have a

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.350 
really providing that ability to have a
smaller<00:02:08.959> footprint<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:10.190> LCD<00:02:10.700> screen<00:02:11.000> was<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
smaller footprint the LCD screen was you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.850 
smaller footprint the LCD screen was you
know<00:02:11.450> as<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:11.690> mentioned<00:02:12.019> was<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.379> cool<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
know as I mentioned was really cool and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.559 
know as I mentioned was really cool and
I<00:02:13.310> think<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.640> could<00:02:13.760> really<00:02:13.819> be<00:02:14.090> useful<00:02:14.480> as

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
I think that could really be useful as

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.570 
I think that could really be useful as
you<00:02:14.690> play<00:02:14.900> games<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.099> start<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.459> use

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
you play games and you know start to use

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.570 
you play games and you know start to use
different<00:02:16.970> gadgets<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:18.280> Keyes<00:02:19.280> had<00:02:19.549> a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
different gadgets with it Keyes had a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280 
different gadgets with it Keyes had a
real<00:02:19.760> nice<00:02:19.879> click<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.480> would<00:02:20.750> say<00:02:20.870> almost<00:02:21.019> like

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
real nice click I would say almost like

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.990 
real nice click I would say almost like
a<00:02:21.319> cookie<00:02:21.590> feel<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:21.950> little<00:02:22.250> bit<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.640> him<00:02:22.790> I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
a cookie feel a little bit to him I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.699 
a cookie feel a little bit to him I
really<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.379> of<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> really

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
really like that and one of the really

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.250 
really like that and one of the really
cool<00:02:24.799> features<00:02:25.430> what<00:02:26.390> was<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.629> volume<00:02:27.019> key<00:02:27.200> it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
cool features what was the volume key it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.750 
cool features what was the volume key it
was<00:02:27.410> almost<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.459> know<00:02:28.489> like<00:02:28.580> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
was almost like a you know like a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.610 
was almost like a you know like a
rolling<00:02:29.180> pin<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.780> could<00:02:29.959> just<00:02:29.989> kind<00:02:30.530> of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
rolling pin and you could just kind of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.259 
rolling pin and you could just kind of
roll<00:02:30.799> up<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.129> down<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.519> get<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.760> volume<00:02:31.970> I

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
roll up and down to get the volume I

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.030 
roll up and down to get the volume I
think<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:32.569> probably<00:02:32.780> one<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.349> best

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
think that's probably one of the best

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.130 
think that's probably one of the best
implementations<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.180> how<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.360> control<00:02:35.750> volume

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
implementations of how to control volume

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.800 
implementations of how to control volume
on<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> keyboard<00:02:36.530> I've<00:02:37.129> seen<00:02:37.549> there's<00:02:38.510> also<00:02:38.660> an

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
on a keyboard I've seen there's also an

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.250 
on a keyboard I've seen there's also an
ability<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.410> disable<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.370> windows<00:02:40.989> lock<00:02:41.989> key

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
ability to disable the windows lock key

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.470 
ability to disable the windows lock key
so<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.829> don't<00:02:43.069> inadvertently<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:44.360> know

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
so that you don't inadvertently you know

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.930 
so that you don't inadvertently you know
flip<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.049> on<00:02:45.110> why<00:02:45.890> you're<00:02:46.099> in<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.640> know<00:02:46.760> in

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
flip that on why you're in a you know in

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.490 
flip that on why you're in a you know in
a<00:02:47.030> heavy<00:02:47.720> frag<00:02:48.049> session<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:51.260> can

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
a heavy frag session and you can

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.610 
a heavy frag session and you can
actually<00:02:51.680> plug<00:02:52.069> your<00:02:53.230> headsets<00:02:54.230> into<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
actually plug your headsets into the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.780 
actually plug your headsets into the
back<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:55.010> gable<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.400> makes<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.700> much

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
back of the gable it makes it much

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.839 
back of the gable it makes it much
easier<00:02:55.849> than<00:02:56.390> going<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.780> back<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.170> pc

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
easier than going to the back of the pc

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.500 
easier than going to the back of the pc
so<00:02:58.849> overall<00:02:59.810> I<00:03:00.170> really<00:03:00.940> enjoyed<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> keyboard

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
so overall I really enjoyed the keyboard

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.869 
so overall I really enjoyed the keyboard
but<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.349> had<00:03:03.530> some<00:03:04.160> concerns<00:03:04.340> about<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:06.879> you

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
but just had some concerns about the you

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.520 
but just had some concerns about the you
know<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.390> size<00:03:08.629> of<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.870> keys<00:03:09.109> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
know really the size of the keys and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.410 
know really the size of the keys and
just<00:03:10.040> couldn't<00:03:10.489> quite<00:03:10.579> get<00:03:10.819> comfortable<00:03:11.209> with

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
just couldn't quite get comfortable with

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.160 
just couldn't quite get comfortable with
the<00:03:11.540> angle<00:03:12.489> but<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.880> know<00:03:14.000> if<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.510> maybe<00:03:15.049> if

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
the angle but you know if you maybe if

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.509 
the angle but you know if you maybe if
I'd<00:03:15.290> spent<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.590> little<00:03:15.709> more<00:03:15.889> time<00:03:16.160> with<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.489> I

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
I'd spent a little more time with it I

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.099 
I'd spent a little more time with it I
would<00:03:16.609> have<00:03:16.819> actually<00:03:16.940> ended<00:03:17.420> up<00:03:17.540> getting

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
would have actually ended up getting

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.470 
would have actually ended up getting
used<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.799> then<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:20.180> know<00:03:20.269> really

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
used to it and then you know really

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
used to it and then you know really
really<00:03:20.840> Angie<00:03:21.079> enjoying<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.560> keyboard<00:03:21.950> after
