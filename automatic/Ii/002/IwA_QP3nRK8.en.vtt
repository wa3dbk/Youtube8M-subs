that we have here actually made for for

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.429 
that we have here actually made for for
cutting<00:00:28.410> along<00:00:29.250> straight<00:00:29.789> edges<00:00:30.510> producing

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
cutting along straight edges producing

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.069 
cutting along straight edges producing
well<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.489> clean<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.590> straight<00:00:34.950> cut<00:00:35.280> so

aluminium<00:00:46.399> I've<00:00:47.399> made<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.149> pre<00:00:49.140> drilled<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
aluminium I've made a pre drilled a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.209 
aluminium I've made a pre drilled a
little<00:00:49.860> hole<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.840> I'm<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> cut<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
little hole here I'm going to cut this

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.600 
little hole here I'm going to cut this
way<00:00:54.050> not<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> outside<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> line

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
way not just on the outside of this line

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.880 
way not just on the outside of this line
so<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> what's<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> inside<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> actual

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
so so what's on the inside is the actual

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.759 
so so what's on the inside is the actual
measurements<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.650> be

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
measurements of what I'm going to be

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.370 
measurements of what I'm going to be
cutting<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.030> tool<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.840> let<00:01:07.350> me

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
cutting and I have this tool here let me

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
cutting and I have this tool here let me
see<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.159> camera<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.820> stand

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
see if I can get my camera to stand

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.510 
see if I can get my camera to stand
while<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> demonstrate<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.799> well<00:01:11.310> I

this drill

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.499 
this drill
that's<00:01:27.659> actually<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:29.250> cutting<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.240> for

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that's actually not for cutting but for

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
that's actually not for cutting but for
well<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.220> drilling<00:01:32.430> sorry<00:01:32.880> it's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
well it's not for drilling sorry it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.560 
well it's not for drilling sorry it's
for<00:01:33.360> cutting<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:36.030> putting<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.450> in

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
for cutting so I'm just putting it in

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.219 
for cutting so I'm just putting it in
here<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:39.710> I'm<00:01:40.710> making<00:01:40.740> sure<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
very very very tight fit so everything

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.380 
very very very tight fit so everything
should<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.450> well<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:49.049> should<00:01:49.259> fit<00:01:49.409> so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
should be as it well it should fit so

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.320 
should be as it well it should fit so
going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> place<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.869> here

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330
