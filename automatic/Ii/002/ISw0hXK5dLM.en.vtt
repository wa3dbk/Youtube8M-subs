hi<00:00:05.490> welcome<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.850> our<00:00:05.940> second<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
hi welcome to our second video in the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.299 
hi welcome to our second video in the
series<00:00:06.870> about<00:00:07.020> enzymes<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.919> today<00:00:08.130> we're

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
series about enzymes and today we're

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.580 
series about enzymes and today we're
going<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.580> be<00:00:08.670> looking<00:00:08.820> at<00:00:09.240> induced<00:00:10.139> fit<00:00:10.410> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
going to be looking at induced fit and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.120 
going to be looking at induced fit and
the<00:00:10.830> lock<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.160> key<00:00:11.309> hypothesis<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:13.950> last

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
the lock and key hypothesis so for last

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.010 
the lock and key hypothesis so for last
time<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.340> looked<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> few<00:00:14.700> key<00:00:15.059> terms<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.750> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
time we looked at a few key terms and so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
time we looked at a few key terms and so
one<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:16.470> ones<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:17.010> an<00:00:17.250> anabolic

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
one of the first ones is in an anabolic

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.060 
one of the first ones is in an anabolic
reaction<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.080> an<00:00:19.170> anabolic<00:00:19.500> reaction

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
reaction so in an anabolic reaction

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.370 
reaction so in an anabolic reaction
enzymes<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.730> used<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.240> bring<00:00:21.900> substrate

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
enzymes are used to bring substrate

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.019 
enzymes are used to bring substrate
molecules<00:00:22.800> together<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.250> form<00:00:23.490> bonds<00:00:23.760> between

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
molecules together to form bonds between

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.929 
molecules together to form bonds between
them<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> catabolic<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
them in a catabolic one and they do the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.970 
them in a catabolic one and they do the
opposite<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:27.720> break<00:00:27.990> bonds

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
opposite of that so they break bonds

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
opposite of that so they break bonds
between<00:00:29.250> molecules<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.449> therefore<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.630> they

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
between molecules and therefore and they

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.260 
between molecules and therefore and they
used<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> break<00:00:34.079> things<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.030> lock

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
used to break things down now the lock

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.299 
used to break things down now the lock
and<00:00:36.480> key<00:00:36.660> hypothesis<00:00:37.500> assumes<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and key hypothesis assumes that the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
and key hypothesis assumes that the
active<00:00:38.640> site<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.420> enzyme<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.960> rigid<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
active site of the enzyme is rigid in

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.049 
active site of the enzyme is rigid in
shape<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.309> were<00:00:41.399> looking<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.940> this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
shape and if we were looking at if this

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
shape and if we were looking at if this
is<00:00:42.180> our<00:00:42.329> enzyme<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.379> section<00:00:43.649> where

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
is our enzyme then this section where

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.319 
is our enzyme then this section where
the<00:00:44.100> substrate<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:44.730> bond<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> called<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the substrate will bond is called the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.560 
the substrate will bond is called the
active<00:00:45.690> site<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:47.579> all

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
active site and it's the bit where all

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.319 
active site and it's the bit where all
enzymes<00:00:49.230> bind<00:00:49.590> their<00:00:49.800> substrates<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.850> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
enzymes bind their substrates now it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.549 
enzymes bind their substrates now it
used<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> case<00:00:52.020> where<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.350> thought

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
used to be the case where we thought

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
used to be the case where we thought
that<00:00:52.829> these<00:00:53.460> active<00:00:53.879> sites<00:00:54.090> were<00:00:54.239> rigid<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that these active sites were rigid and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
that these active sites were rigid and
therefore<00:00:55.350> didn't<00:00:56.309> change<00:00:56.550> their<00:00:56.760> shape<00:00:56.940> at

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
therefore didn't change their shape at

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.830 
therefore didn't change their shape at
all<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.730> only<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.600> very

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
all and and so only a very very

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
all and and so only a very very
specifically<00:01:01.530> shape<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> substrate<00:01:02.579> could

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
specifically shape the substrate could

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.780 
specifically shape the substrate could
fit<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.949> but<00:01:04.949> current<00:01:05.309> tests<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.760> shown

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
fit in and but current tests have shown

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.359 
fit in and but current tests have shown
and<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.869> looking<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.290> other<00:01:07.500> top<00:01:07.979> forms<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and from looking at other top forms a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.310 
and from looking at other top forms a
day<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.119> found<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.720> doesn't

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
day and then we found that that doesn't

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
day and then we found that that doesn't
necessarily<00:01:10.470> always<00:01:11.250> ring<00:01:11.460> true<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
necessarily always ring true and so the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.330 
necessarily always ring true and so the
best<00:01:12.659> current<00:01:13.080> hypothesis<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.100> current

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
best current hypothesis the best current

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
best current hypothesis the best current
idea<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.900> called<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
idea that we have for this is called the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.070 
idea that we have for this is called the
induced<00:01:16.619> fit<00:01:16.830> hypothesis<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.840> that's<00:01:18.840> where

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
induced fit hypothesis and that's where

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
induced fit hypothesis and that's where
the<00:01:19.229> active<00:01:19.740> site<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.189> flexible<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the active site can be flexible and so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740 
the active site can be flexible and so
what<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.560> happen<00:01:22.939> is<00:01:23.939> our<00:01:24.119> substrate<00:01:24.509> will

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
what will happen is our substrate will

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.649 
what will happen is our substrate will
bind<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.610> case<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
bind in and in this case this is this is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.149 
bind in and in this case this is this is
an<00:01:27.750> anabolic<00:01:28.229> reaction<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.040> will

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
an anabolic reaction and what will

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.289 
an anabolic reaction and what will
happen<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> active<00:01:29.970> site<00:01:30.150> will

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
happen is the active site will

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.280 
happen is the active site will
physically<00:01:30.810> change<00:01:31.110> shape<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.650> suit<00:01:33.290> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
physically change shape to suit the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
physically change shape to suit the
shape<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> substrate<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.340> hence<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
shape of the substrate and hence the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.440 
shape of the substrate and hence the
induced<00:01:36.299> fit<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.740> happen<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
induced fit what will happen when the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.770 
induced fit what will happen when the
enzyme<00:01:39.780> leaves<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> active<00:01:40.710> site<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.780> enzyme

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
enzyme leaves the active site the enzyme

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.840 
enzyme leaves the active site the enzyme
will<00:01:42.960> revert<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.619> its<00:01:43.860> inactive<00:01:44.579> state

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
will revert back to its inactive state

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.840 
will revert back to its inactive state
I'm<00:01:45.509> sure<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.780> run<00:01:45.990> through<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.320> again

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
I'm sure if we run through there again

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.480 
I'm sure if we run through there again
you've<00:01:47.850> got<00:01:48.320> essentially<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.649> induced<00:01:50.040> fit

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you've got essentially an induced fit

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
you've got essentially an induced fit
hypothesis<00:01:51.149> whereby<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.619> active<00:01:52.979> site

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
hypothesis whereby the active site

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.639 
hypothesis whereby the active site
doesn't<00:01:53.729> necessarily<00:01:54.390> fit<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.720> shape<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> the

doesn't necessarily fit the shape of the
substrate<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.079> an<00:01:58.200> anabolic<00:01:58.560> reaction

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
substrate and so in an anabolic reaction

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.179 
substrate and so in an anabolic reaction
here<00:01:59.430> what<00:02:00.270> happens<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> active<00:02:01.979> site

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
here what happens and is the active site

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.149 
here what happens and is the active site
will<00:02:02.460> basically<00:02:03.149> fit<00:02:03.450> around<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
will basically fit around it and

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.300 
will basically fit around it and
therefore<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.729> an<00:02:05.909> induced<00:02:06.390> fit<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.979> once

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
therefore it's an induced fit then once

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.029 
therefore it's an induced fit then once
the<00:02:08.819> substrate<00:02:09.239> leaves<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:10.319> reverts<00:02:10.649> back<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the substrate leaves it reverts back to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.339 
the substrate leaves it reverts back to
its<00:02:11.310> original<00:02:11.459> shape

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
its original shape

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.470 
its original shape
and<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:13.829> this<00:02:13.920> diagram<00:02:14.099> here<00:02:14.489> shows<00:02:14.790> us<00:02:14.819> an

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and so this diagram here shows us an

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.289 
and so this diagram here shows us an
example<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.230> an<00:02:16.650> enzyme<00:02:16.890> lipase<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.999> so

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
example of an enzyme lipase and so

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.360 
example of an enzyme lipase and so
lipase<00:02:18.719> breaks<00:02:18.749> down<00:02:19.170> fats<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.249> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
lipase breaks down fats and so the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.940 
lipase breaks down fats and so the
active<00:02:20.700> site<00:02:20.939> of<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.650> specifically<00:02:22.650> down

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
active site of this is specifically down

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.739 
active site of this is specifically down
to<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.219> tertiary<00:02:23.459> structure<00:02:23.969> of<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.299> protein

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
to the tertiary structure of the protein

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.619 
to the tertiary structure of the protein
and<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.829> it's<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.189> it's<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.639> folding<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:27.389> from

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
and so it's the it's the folding in from

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.030 
and so it's the it's the folding in from
the<00:02:27.749> circulatory<00:02:28.109> structure<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.799> gives

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the circulatory structure that gives

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.550 
the circulatory structure that gives
this<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.219> very<00:02:29.549> very<00:02:29.700> specific<00:02:29.939> shape

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
this a very very specific shape

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.720 
this a very very specific shape
initially<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.250> order<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.609> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
initially it's the is the order of the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.030 
initially it's the is the order of the
amino<00:02:33.000> acids<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.689> then<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.590> secondary

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
amino acids and then the secondary

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.830 
amino acids and then the secondary
structure<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.579> then<00:02:35.700> how<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:35.879> folds<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.569> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
structure and then how that folds in to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
structure and then how that folds in to
form<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.170> tertiary<00:02:37.500> structure<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.219> means

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
form the tertiary structure that means

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.589 
form the tertiary structure that means
only<00:02:38.549> certain<00:02:39.090> substrates<00:02:39.659> can<00:02:39.780> fit<00:02:40.609> and<00:02:41.609> so

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
only certain substrates can fit and so

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.539 
only certain substrates can fit and so
that<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:43.169> is<00:02:43.349> very<00:02:43.560> very<00:02:43.680> specific<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.459> will

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
that this is very very specific and will

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.190 
that this is very very specific and will
only<00:02:44.669> break<00:02:44.999> down<00:02:45.209> certain<00:02:45.569> types<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.900> fat

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
only break down certain types of fat

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.470 
only break down certain types of fat
whereas<00:02:46.889> if<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.159> want<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.879> enzyme<00:02:48.329> to

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
whereas if you want it and enzyme to

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.679 
whereas if you want it and enzyme to
break<00:02:48.719> down<00:02:49.040> protein<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.219> protease<00:02:50.700> then<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
break down protein or protease then that

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.659 
break down protein or protease then that
will<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> slightly<00:02:52.290> different<00:02:52.669> active

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
will have a slightly different active

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.009 
will have a slightly different active
site<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.180> would<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.419> a<00:02:54.480> very<00:02:54.780> different

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
site and would have a very different

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.459 
site and would have a very different
tertiary<00:02:55.620> structure<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.840> some<00:02:58.049> important

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
tertiary structure and so some important

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.899 
tertiary structure and so some important
things<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:58.919> with<00:02:59.040> enzymes<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.639> only

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
things to do with enzymes they only

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.759 
things to do with enzymes they only
change<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.359> rate<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.780> reaction<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.500> rate

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
change the rate of reaction so rate

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.770 
change the rate of reaction so rate
means<00:03:02.370> how<00:03:02.489> quickly<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.090> happening<00:03:03.449> they

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
means how quickly it's happening they

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.479 
means how quickly it's happening they
don't<00:03:04.049> change<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.530> equilibrium<00:03:05.099> or<00:03:05.219> the<00:03:05.340> end

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
don't change the equilibrium or the end

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.569 
don't change the equilibrium or the end
products<00:03:05.879> they<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.060> no<00:03:06.269> effect<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.280> type

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
products they have no effect on the type

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.390 
products they have no effect on the type
of<00:03:08.609> product<00:03:09.359> that's<00:03:09.510> made<00:03:09.719> so<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:11.069> instance

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
of product that's made so for instance

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.390 
of product that's made so for instance
if<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.669> have<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.150> breakdown<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:13.280> let's<00:03:14.280> say

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
if you have the breakdown of let's say

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.080 
if you have the breakdown of let's say
starch<00:03:14.790> into<00:03:15.209> glucose<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:16.409> won't<00:03:16.739> change<00:03:17.099> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
starch into glucose it won't change the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.819 
starch into glucose it won't change the
enzyme<00:03:18.419> won't<00:03:18.720> change<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.290> actual<00:03:19.409> end

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
enzyme won't change the actual end

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.729 
enzyme won't change the actual end
products<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:21.329> will<00:03:21.479> only<00:03:21.659> ever<00:03:21.870> speed<00:03:22.379> up<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
products it will only ever speed up the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.920 
products it will only ever speed up the
reaction<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:24.000> are<00:03:24.120> specific<00:03:24.629> to<00:03:24.750> one

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
reaction and they are specific to one

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.360 
reaction and they are specific to one
particular<00:03:25.109> reaction<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:25.949> is<00:03:26.129> down<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
particular reaction this is down to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.479 
particular reaction this is down to
their<00:03:26.669> specific<00:03:27.139> tertiary<00:03:28.139> structure<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
their specific tertiary structure and

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.710 
their specific tertiary structure and
they're<00:03:29.669> present<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.120> very<00:03:30.419> very<00:03:30.569> small

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
they're present in very very small

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.929 
they're present in very very small
amounts<00:03:31.439> and<00:03:31.620> due<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.549> high<00:03:32.729> molecular

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
amounts and due to high molecular

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.610 
amounts and due to high molecular
activity<00:03:33.419> so<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.019> means<00:03:34.229> you<00:03:34.319> only<00:03:34.379> need<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
activity so that means you only need a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.649 
activity so that means you only need a
very<00:03:34.650> very<00:03:34.919> small<00:03:35.280> amount<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.699> them<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:35.909> to

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
very very small amount of them and to

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.050 
very very small amount of them and to
get<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.930> huge<00:03:37.290> marked<00:03:37.650> effect<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.759> value

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
get this huge marked effect this value

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.149 
get this huge marked effect this value
here<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> turnover<00:03:39.720> number<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.829> number<00:03:40.859> of

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
here a turnover number is the number of

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.589 
here a turnover number is the number of
substrate<00:03:41.549> molecules<00:03:41.909> transferred<00:03:42.419> per

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
substrate molecules transferred per

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.809 
substrate molecules transferred per
minute<00:03:42.900> by<00:03:43.019> one<00:03:43.290> enzyme<00:03:43.680> molecule<00:03:44.189> and<00:03:44.430> in

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
minute by one enzyme molecule and in

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.640 
minute by one enzyme molecule and in
this<00:03:44.970> case<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.659> catalase<00:03:46.290> which<00:03:46.500> is

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
this case this is catalase which is

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.280 
this case this is catalase which is
amongst<00:03:47.189> the<00:03:47.370> quickest<00:03:48.090> enzymes<00:03:48.959> we<00:03:49.139> know

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
amongst the quickest enzymes we know

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.009 
amongst the quickest enzymes we know
it's<00:03:50.009> made<00:03:50.489> by<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.729> liver<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.209> it's<00:03:51.449> this<00:03:51.780> is

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
it's made by the liver and it's this is

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.379 
it's made by the liver and it's this is
should<00:03:52.349> be<00:03:52.470> six<00:03:52.799> by<00:03:52.979> ten<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.549> power<00:03:53.849> of<00:03:53.909> six

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
should be six by ten to the power of six

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.469 
should be six by ten to the power of six
that<00:03:55.019> basically<00:03:55.349> six<00:03:55.849> followed<00:03:56.849> by<00:03:56.939> six<00:03:57.269> not

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
that basically six followed by six not

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.800 
that basically six followed by six not
so<00:03:57.629> that's<00:03:57.719> six<00:03:58.139> million<00:03:58.409> per<00:03:59.129> minute<00:03:59.459> and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
so that's six million per minute and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.809 
so that's six million per minute and
which<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.959> staggering<00:04:01.199> number<00:04:01.439> if<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.579> join

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
which is a staggering number if you join

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.490 
which is a staggering number if you join
me<00:04:02.939> on<00:04:02.969> the<00:04:03.120> next<00:04:03.299> video<00:04:03.629> where<00:04:04.259> I'll<00:04:04.379> be

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
me on the next video where I'll be

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.740 
me on the next video where I'll be
looking<00:04:04.919> at<00:04:05.099> rates<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.519> reaction<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.269> how

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
looking at rates of reaction and how

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.979 
looking at rates of reaction and how
enzymes<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.409> be<00:04:07.439> effective<00:04:07.889> on<00:04:08.009> different

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
enzymes can be effective on different

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.989 
enzymes can be effective on different
conditions
