 intense in the high performance center 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.350

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.539
 the legionaries among them we talked 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.279
 with guillermo ochoa al chicharito 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.040
 hernandez as well as with andres saved 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.040
 these are the words of the protagonists 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.370
 we have achieved that all with the same 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.650
 idea and good is very important while 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.489
 more competition we will only generate the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.940
 team will grow more and we have it 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.320
 we all have the idea 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.090
 and really change what has happened and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.289
 that not only must we say we have 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.850
 said must be said between us 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.379
 externalize it but doing it has also been 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.989
 come working with them in the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.719
 specific work situation with 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.390
 archer all have their times 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.790
 similar to the same, there is no one there 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.229
 difference with none are going to have the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.299
 same the same full match each 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.060
 and when the fourth game comes and the 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.670
 week before the opening party of the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.860
 world cup for us 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.380
 and obviously we will start to decide 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.810
 which of the three in our taste what 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.850
 we pretend we have highlighted more 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.680
 to be able to think about the common title there 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.360
 what to see for mexico we are all here 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.830
 to make a good independent world 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.570
 who plays only here will 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.420
 he asked if he wants to play that is 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.130
 normal is part of our of our 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.810
 personality but obviously 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.490
 we think about the team and we think that 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.710
 If we make history we will all that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.330
 every coach has his systems not of 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.640
 between for the field and good obviously 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.750
 to us as players what they have 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.490
 you have to do it in the best way 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.690
 no and in this case what he asks me to do 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.039
 inside the court also outside of 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.569
 she that we have to do a good 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.909
 environment but that I know that that happens 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.729
 only because of the great quality of the people 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.530
 here of the selection I do not think there's 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.299
 much need to work on that is given 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.979
 alone because as you see it we 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.209
 we are all very well very much have 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.740
 a lot of time working for example 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.360
 in their clubs and in selections of the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.039
 goodbye we are also going to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.929
 meet our second world many 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.100
 they repeat also then I think it's going 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.840
 giving alone but what good obviously 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.120
 if it benefits the simply I have to 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.709
 devote to talk inside the court to 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.269
 do it as my team has come action 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.560
 and prove it there in the 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.480
 training 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.940
 in the games and ready at the end the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.760
 entrance is going to decide the most important thing 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.620
 to be a good group and keep gaining pace 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.049
 and the most important thing for me is the group 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.110
 I believe that while we are united and 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.150
 let's all be to it that's going to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.060
 carry great things with great enthusiasm 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 with a lot of commitment working 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.739
 working very well all the whole group and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.629
 good the truth that happy to be here 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.879
 happy with the opportunity they give us 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.340
 I am already here and now that there is 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.379
 change the chip with the selection 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.560
 I can participate in a national 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.819
 globally I have to work hard to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.200
 quickly adapt to the pace that 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
 they have the companions and thus to be able 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.560
 compete also commented that it has been 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.790
 difficult to work having continuity 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.549
 because he started with nine players 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.829
 concentrated today is 17 and still you 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.959
 6 more are missing to complete the group on 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.639
 which will be ready next week 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.920
 when they have the farewell party 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.480
 against israel in the aztec stadium from 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.440
 the city of mexico almost calls it 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.440
