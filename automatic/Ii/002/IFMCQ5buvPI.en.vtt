00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
 it is not 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.890
 4 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.550
 this year all the main methods for a new video 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.669
 commentary 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.289
 today it's a video 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.909
 prophet gameplay on the match by two 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:15.739
 one of the victims 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.220
 verdict the conductor 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 and then I did two days ago 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.569
 I will quote the cities so much 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:26.749
 this video 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.519
 so for some 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.300
 some will say 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.399
 what happened to a nice video it's a regular video it's me 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.880
 I thought he was very good 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.690
 marriage chained already three titles 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 ensure a mix 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 the company expects me to be in this part 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.800
 so as see on every hand 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.770
 intervention 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 instead of counting m6 count a little confused 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.180
 and it works pretty well I'm already 5 0 if I'm in the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.740
 so here I have to see page 6 0 I take as you go to see it takes itself 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 not even the cooldown 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.560
 he king's daughter 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.250
 I looked at the only one watching the score the part he's just getting started 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.119
 money on average 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.580
 although this part do I have them just following the one on 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.160
 a particularity 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.220
 but if what i could i posted on youtube 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.520
 so I had also nuclear so this is the second year that rpg at 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.730
 conflict 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.600
 alas I was a little afraid of being killed by 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.900
 they demand the end 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 shoot in my back 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 darmian fatia poupou 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.570
 this law are leaving more 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.570
 so I'm waiting for the end of my marriage 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.150
 it's true that I did a lot of weight and 45 pounds but it's already 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.290
 received the age trophy like that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.699
 he expects I have to do 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
 some other hogwash I find his account ap 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 italy 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.499
 the tests will begin April 13 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.569
 and who do not know and I still get killed at the same time what plays 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.249
 not cool 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:21.859
 not so sure that I'm going away 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.799
 34th no matter where 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 so here I resume 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.399
 how do you see he is already playing a lot in the intervention 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:33.799
 it seems to me 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.799
 I do not know 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.459
 the manager at miller 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 nice double target I'm pretty proud of myself 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.309
 i think i had pretty much all the debts being fit 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.949
 and so 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.649
 m there I continue to 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.849
 of course everything is not all Monday's joke of 9 hours 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.459
 they are waiting for the end for kuyt 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.559
 there is 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.559
 I will not stop 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.119
 why the busy that the economy was not true 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:14.119
 Driving pleasure 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.939
 on the same tone 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:20.430
 It's really bad luck 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.610
 I am at 41 18 0 me 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.610
 that's his way 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.439
 so I decided to raise a little bit of that poor side and if you do not 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.409
 find 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.409
 few hours because of the charity 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.770
 I think I can succeed 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.469
 well, it's okay 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:49.089
 so for me I'm not too used to reject the water at the intervention itself 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.309
 word to barrettes in general I believe 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:54.449
 just like 42 euros 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.770
 in general I camp when I do not count in the same place but nothing I 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.539
 not too bad 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.539
 the gsma 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.289
 when we do that it's more fun to have a lot of shots 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.229
 he had left feathers 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.229
 the clemency 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.729
 however i believe yes madarail is going to have his universe also in this 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.729
 part 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.759
 so the traps 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.909
 another point that makes here 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:49.499
 tf1 remains leader 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.339
 he does not leave 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.300
 so you can finally like you I'm happy to have it 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.569
 the pacers christie this disc 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.050
 and yes what I like what I meant cqfd 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.089
 when I read your end of season 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.309
 when I make a video with who 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:07.779
 of the rank 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.779
 but of course to return to the busy 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.229
 yesterday, November 26 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.029
 alas according to 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.550
 unaccustomed to waking him up 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.960
 what a shock 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.189
 it's this way 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:37.189
 he follows me everywhere so I do not know how he did it 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.490
 so here I am very happy to have introduced the gameplay but 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.490
 I hope you will subscribe 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.550
 there this country 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.979
