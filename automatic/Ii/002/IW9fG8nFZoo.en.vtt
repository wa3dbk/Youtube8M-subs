any reason for Republicans to want to do
anything<00:01:41.510> I<00:01:42.220> mean<00:01:43.220> we<00:01:43.730> can<00:01:43.880> debate<00:01:44.000> what<00:01:44.330> our

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
I don't need a poll to know that most of

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.710 
I don't need a poll to know that most of
Republican<00:01:52.940> voters<00:01:53.860> are<00:01:54.860> opposed<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:56.060> this

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
Republican voters are opposed to this

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.950 
Republican voters are opposed to this
bill<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.230> might<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.100> opposed<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.690> kind<00:01:59.900> of

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
bill and might be opposed to the kind of

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.840 
bill and might be opposed to the kind of
compromise<00:02:00.350> we<00:02:00.650> could<00:02:00.830> craft<00:02:01.100> that'd<00:02:01.640> be<00:02:01.820> very

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
compromise we could craft that'd be very

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.000 
compromise we could craft that'd be very
hard<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.510> politically<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.710> do<00:02:03.830> this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
hard for you politically to to do this

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.340 
hard for you politically to to do this
but<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.340> thought<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.240> was<00:02:08.330> worthwhile<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:09.290> us

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
but I thought it was worthwhile for us

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.040 
but I thought it was worthwhile for us
to<00:02:09.590> make<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:09.980> effort<00:02:10.600> we've<00:02:11.600> got<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> lot<00:02:12.020> of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
to make this effort we've got a lot of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.940 
to make this effort we've got a lot of
other<00:02:12.170> things<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.620> do

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
other things to do

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.530 
other things to do
I<00:02:12.980> don't<00:02:13.340> think<00:02:13.430> Tom<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.210> we're<00:02:14.300> gonna<00:02:14.390> have

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
I don't think Tom that we're gonna have

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.780 
I don't think Tom that we're gonna have
another<00:02:14.780> one<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:15.110> these<00:02:15.170> because<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:16.250> people

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
another one of these because we people

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.920 
another one of these because we people
don't<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.850> know<00:02:19.940> there's<00:02:20.450> seven<00:02:20.810> eight

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
don't have you know there's seven eight

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.810 
don't have you know there's seven eight
hours<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> day<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:22.250> work<00:02:22.430> some<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.700> these

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
hours a day to work some of these

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.730 
hours a day to work some of these
through<00:02:23.060> things<00:02:23.360> through<00:02:23.630> what<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.320> do<00:02:24.440> know<00:02:24.710> is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
through things through what I do know is

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.490 
through things through what I do know is
this<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:26.980> we<00:02:27.980> saw<00:02:28.190> movement<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:29.500> significant

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
this if we saw movement a significant

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.180 
this if we saw movement a significant
movement<00:02:30.650> not<00:02:32.350> not<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.380> gestures<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:36.380> you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
movement not not just gestures then you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.090 
movement not not just gestures then you
wouldn't<00:02:37.430> need<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.910> start<00:02:38.210> over<00:02:38.480> because

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
wouldn't need to start over because

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.140 
wouldn't need to start over because
essentially<00:02:40.100> everybody<00:02:40.310> here<00:02:40.580> knows<00:02:40.790> what

the issues are and procedurally it could
get<00:02:46.910> done<00:02:47.380> fairly<00:02:48.380> quickly<00:02:49.209> we<00:02:50.209> cannot<00:02:50.480> have

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
get done fairly quickly we cannot have

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.620 
get done fairly quickly we cannot have

myself and I ask of all all of you is is
there<00:03:00.590> enough<00:03:01.270> serious<00:03:02.270> effort<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.760> a

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
there enough serious effort that in a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.160 
there enough serious effort that in a
month's<00:03:05.330> time<00:03:05.360> or<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:06.050> few<00:03:06.890> weeks<00:03:07.100> time<00:03:07.370> or<00:03:08.170> six

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
month's time or a few weeks time or six

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.280 
month's time or a few weeks time or six
weeks<00:03:09.350> time<00:03:10.510> we<00:03:11.510> could<00:03:11.660> actually<00:03:11.989> resolve

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
weeks time we could actually resolve

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.560 
weeks time we could actually resolve
something<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.580> we<00:03:13.700> can't<00:03:13.970> then<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.360> think

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
something and if we can't then I think

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.180 
something and if we can't then I think
we've<00:03:14.690> got<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.930> go<00:03:15.050> ahead<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.350> make<00:03:16.010> some

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
we've got to go ahead and make some

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.560 
we've got to go ahead and make some
decisions<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.700> then<00:03:16.880> that's<00:03:17.150> what<00:03:17.270> elections

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570
