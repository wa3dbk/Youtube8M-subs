when we put the Aiken

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.740 
when we put the Aiken
vinegar<00:00:20.610> I<00:00:20.640> think<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.150> going<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
vinegar I think it's going in a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.640 
vinegar I think it's going in a
saturated<00:00:22.200> put<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> egg<00:00:23.040> in<00:00:23.150> vinegar<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.720> see

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
saturated put the egg in vinegar I see

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
saturated put the egg in vinegar I see
all<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.520> them<00:00:26.910> will<00:00:27.720> latch<00:00:32.930> my<00:00:33.930> hypothesis<00:00:34.830> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
all of them will latch my hypothesis is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.580 
all of them will latch my hypothesis is
it's<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.030> jars<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.720> follow<00:00:36.930> my

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it's going the jars going to follow my

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.760 
it's going the jars going to follow my
hypothesis<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:39.170> when<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> put<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.620> egg

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
hypothesis is that when you put the egg

00:00:40.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
hypothesis is that when you put the egg
in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.280> vinegar<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.530> like<00:01:00.470> no<00:01:02.390> female<00:01:03.390> this
