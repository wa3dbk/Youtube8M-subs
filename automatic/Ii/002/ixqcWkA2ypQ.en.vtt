if<00:00:00.240> he<00:00:00.390> made<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.719> for<00:00:00.900> three<00:00:01.260> there<00:00:01.410> and<00:00:01.530> he

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
if he made this for three there and he

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.780 
if he made this for three there and he
something<00:00:01.770> lit<00:00:01.979> up<00:00:02.070> I'd<00:00:02.250> be<00:00:02.280> screwed<00:00:02.610> because

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
something lit up I'd be screwed because

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.400 
something lit up I'd be screwed because
and<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.419> huge<00:00:03.629> battle<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.049> here<00:00:04.230> as<00:00:04.319> you

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
and a huge battle going on here as you

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.749 
and a huge battle going on here as you
can<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.830> don't<00:00:04.920> know<00:00:05.040> where's<00:00:05.250> older<00:00:05.520> I

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
can see I don't know where's older I

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.340 
can see I don't know where's older I
guess<00:00:05.940> he<00:00:06.029> doesn't<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.480> many<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.839> now

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
guess he doesn't have that many and now

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.500 
guess he doesn't have that many and now
I<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.710> storm<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.370> storms<00:00:08.700> key<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.150> except

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I have storm and storms key here except

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.669 
I have storm and storms key here except
I<00:00:09.660> don't<00:00:09.750> know<00:00:09.929> what<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> storm<00:00:10.349> because<00:00:10.530> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
I don't know what the storm because it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.320 
I don't know what the storm because it
was<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.099> group<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.519> units<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.910> can<00:00:12.059> storm

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
was not a group of units that can storm

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.690 
was not a group of units that can storm
and<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:13.170> he<00:00:13.230> picked<00:00:13.380> off<00:00:13.559> all<00:00:13.769> my<00:00:13.950> crap<00:00:14.549> he

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and I think he picked off all my crap he

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.740 
and I think he picked off all my crap he
actually<00:00:14.880> did<00:00:15.120> pick<00:00:15.240> off<00:00:15.360> pretty<00:00:15.570> much

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
actually did pick off pretty much

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.230 
actually did pick off pretty much
everything<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.430> very<00:00:17.460> bad<00:00:17.880> storm

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
everything and I have very bad storm

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.790 
everything and I have very bad storm
here<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.660> screens<00:00:18.960> liking<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.470> second

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
here not my screens liking for a second

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.109 
here not my screens liking for a second
so<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> can't<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.250> tell<00:00:20.460> who's<00:00:20.670> winning<00:00:20.939> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
so I can't really tell who's winning and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.900 
so I can't really tell who's winning and
now<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> guess<00:00:21.960> he<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.230> winning<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.609> sucks

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
now I guess he is winning but that sucks

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.420 
now I guess he is winning but that sucks
on<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.210> part<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.130> think<00:00:26.250> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
on my part because I actually I think I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.529 
on my part because I actually I think I
could<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.699> won<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.150> stormed<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
could have won that if I stormed a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.919 
could have won that if I stormed a
little<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.840> better<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.470> didn't<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.130> that

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
little bit better but I didn't so that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.179 
little bit better but I didn't so that
bad<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.170> part<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
bad on my part if you have if you're a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.770 
bad on my part if you have if you're a
zerg<00:00:32.369> player<00:00:32.399> card<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:32.969> clump<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.510> units

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
zerg player card not clump up your units

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420 
zerg player card not clump up your units
because<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.469> makes<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.800> hard<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> Protoss

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
because it makes it hard for the Protoss

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
because it makes it hard for the Protoss
player<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.480> went<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> storm<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
player to know when went to storm and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
player to know when went to storm and
what<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.739> storm<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.480> yeah<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.629> just

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
what to storm because yeah it's just

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
what to storm because yeah it's just
hard<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.020> pertussis<00:00:40.680> strong<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.100> there's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
hard for pertussis strong one there's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.740 
hard for pertussis strong one there's
like<00:00:41.460> nothing<00:00:41.910> grouped<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.450> because<00:00:42.660> they

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
like nothing grouped up because they

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.150 
like nothing grouped up because they
don't<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> waste<00:00:43.379> their<00:00:43.590> storm<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> like

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
don't want to waste their storm and like

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
don't want to waste their storm and like
small<00:00:44.760> stuff<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
small stuff like that and now as you can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.520 
small stuff like that and now as you can
see<00:00:46.140> 10<00:00:46.410> coursers<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:47.700> amount<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.530> as

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
see 10 coursers pretty good amount I as

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.080 
see 10 coursers pretty good amount I as
you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.129> getting<00:00:50.550> his<00:00:50.610> fifth<00:00:50.879> base

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you can see he is getting his fifth base

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
you can see he is getting his fifth base
to<00:00:51.300> fourth<00:00:51.539> place<00:00:51.629> entirely<00:00:51.960> sure<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.410> has

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to fourth place entirely sure if he has

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
to fourth place entirely sure if he has
a<00:00:52.530> natural<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.160> yeah<00:00:53.670> he<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a natural here yeah he does have the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.459 
a natural here yeah he does have the
natural<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.870> drop<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
natural so I'm gonna go drop that and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
natural so I'm gonna go drop that and
I'm<00:00:56.010> Justin<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.460> know<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.640> by<00:00:56.910> looking<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
I'm Justin I know this by looking at the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
I'm Justin I know this by looking at the
mini-map<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.989> yeah<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.920> he<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.030> more<00:01:00.210> bases

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
mini-map and yeah so he has more bases

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
mini-map and yeah so he has more bases
i'm<00:01:00.750> gonna<00:01:01.079> i<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.350> i<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:01.800> yeah<00:01:02.219> i

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
i'm gonna i think i have for now yeah i

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
i'm gonna i think i have for now yeah i
do<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.520> four<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.660> probably

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
do a four and so we're probably

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
do a four and so we're probably
economically<00:01:04.379> ties<00:01:04.739> except<00:01:05.159> he's<00:01:05.280> getting

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
economically ties except he's getting

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
economically ties except he's getting
his<00:01:05.610> fifth<00:01:05.820> base<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.330> storm<00:01:07.080> drops<00:01:07.350> again

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
his fifth base and now storm drops again

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
his fifth base and now storm drops again

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
bases and trying to harass him as much

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.580 
bases and trying to harass him as much
as<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.960> he<00:01:22.080> doesn't<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
as I can so he doesn't have this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
as I can so he doesn't have this
economic<00:01:23.040> edge<00:01:23.159> because<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
economic edge because think about it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.490 
economic edge because think about it
right<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.659> only<00:01:24.780> three<00:01:24.990> bases<00:01:25.290> first

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
right now it's only three bases first

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.780 
right now it's only three bases first
three<00:01:25.740> bases<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.280> keep<00:01:26.400> picking<00:01:26.670> off

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
three bases because I keep picking off

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
three bases because I keep picking off
the<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.090> picked<00:01:27.360> off<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> drone<00:01:27.960> line<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the I picked off the drone line at this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.130 
the I picked off the drone line at this
fourth<00:01:28.920> place<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:30.390> thinking<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> going

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
fourth place and I'm thinking of going

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
fourth place and I'm thinking of going
to<00:01:31.920> his<00:01:32.130> third<00:01:32.909> base<00:01:33.090> except<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.570> were

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to his third base except there's were

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.060 
to his third base except there's were
calling<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> guess<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.770> couldn't

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
calling you there so I guess I couldn't

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
calling you there so I guess I couldn't

opponent and now as you can see i lost
my<00:02:40.860> fourth<00:02:41.070> base<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.520> I'm<00:02:42.000> mining<00:02:42.540> up<00:02:42.660> one<00:02:42.810> base

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
my fourth base so I'm mining up one base

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.080 
my fourth base so I'm mining up one base
while<00:02:43.710> he's<00:02:43.890> probably<00:02:44.070> mining<00:02:44.430> off<00:02:44.550> three<00:02:44.970> or

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
while he's probably mining off three or

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.090 
while he's probably mining off three or
four<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:46.140> really<00:02:46.320> really<00:02:46.650> bad<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:46.980> my

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
four so that's really really bad on my

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.580 
four so that's really really bad on my
part<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.550> now<00:02:48.060> shadow<00:02:48.810> coming<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.200> here<00:02:49.350> he

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
part and now shadow coming in here he

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.660 
part and now shadow coming in here he
probably<00:02:49.770> saw<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.280> he's<00:02:50.460> gonna<00:02:50.550> be

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
probably saw it so he's gonna be

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.850 
probably saw it so he's gonna be
prepared<00:02:51.090> unless<00:02:51.780> he<00:02:52.080> can't<00:02:52.320> he<00:02:52.500> didn't<00:02:52.740> see

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
prepared unless he can't he didn't see

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.240 
prepared unless he can't he didn't see
it<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.290> gonna<00:02:55.470> drop<00:02:55.740> him<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.190> he

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it and now I'm gonna drop him but he

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.620 
it and now I'm gonna drop him but he
doesn't<00:02:56.520> have<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.760> much<00:02:56.910> second<00:02:57.210> storm<00:02:57.450> but

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
doesn't have that much second storm but

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.120 
doesn't have that much second storm but
I'll<00:02:57.720> still<00:02:57.900> storm<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.620> came<00:02:58.800> into<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
I'll still storm because I came into the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.500 
I'll still storm because I came into the
drop<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.490> might<00:02:59.640> as<00:02:59.700> well<00:02:59.850> do<00:02:59.940> it<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.270> now

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
drop so I might as well do it and now

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
drop so I might as well do it and now
storming<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.800> can<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.010> he<00:03:02.130> did<00:03:02.280> run

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
storming as you can see he did run

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.250 
storming as you can see he did run
except<00:03:02.850> he<00:03:02.940> ran<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.300> late<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.840> now<00:03:03.990> he's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
except he ran a little late and now he's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.050 
except he ran a little late and now he's
running<00:03:04.440> he<00:03:04.800> came<00:03:05.100> back<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.310> his<00:03:05.550> John<00:03:05.820> so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
running he came back with his John so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.340 
running he came back with his John so
I'm<00:03:06.120> gonna<00:03:06.240> see<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.750> any<00:03:06.780> storm<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.320> I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
I'm gonna see if I have any storm but I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.960 
I'm gonna see if I have any storm but I
don't<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.680> any<00:03:07.830> storm<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.310> after<00:03:08.550> loaded

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
don't have any storm so I'm after loaded

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.670 
don't have any storm so I'm after loaded
and<00:03:09.000> come<00:03:09.750> back<00:03:09.840> later<00:03:10.110> when<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.410> do<00:03:10.470> have

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
and come back later when I do have

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.650 
and come back later when I do have
storms<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:11.430> he<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.330> can<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:12.540> he's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
storms and now he as you can see he's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.970 
storms and now he as you can see he's
quite<00:03:12.930> high<00:03:13.080> drilling<00:03:13.380> that's<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> best

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
quite high drilling that's the best

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.530 
quite high drilling that's the best
thing<00:03:14.070> that's<00:03:14.250> very<00:03:14.280> fair<00:03:14.490> can<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.820> versus<00:03:15.150> ADT

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
thing that's very fair can do versus ADT

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.050 
thing that's very fair can do versus ADT
I<00:03:15.750> guess<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:16.980> they<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.280> go<00:03:17.400> queens<00:03:17.700> without

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I guess or they can go queens without

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.610 
I guess or they can go queens without
feeling<00:03:18.390> if<00:03:18.600> your<00:03:18.780> goes<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.170> but<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> don't

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
feeling if your goes to but I don't

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.230 
feeling if your goes to but I don't
anyone<00:03:20.070> here<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:20.490> watching<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:21.060> this

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
close to you can go Queens and ensnare

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.340 
close to you can go Queens and ensnare
the<00:03:23.850> cloaked<00:03:24.240> units<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.990> see<00:03:25.170> them

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the cloaked units so you can see them

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
strategy you think is good but pro

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.800 
strategy you think is good but pro
gamers<00:03:44.100> never<00:03:44.280> do<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.580> there's<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.450> reason

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
behind it and don't think they don't

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.640 
behind it and don't think they don't
know<00:03:48.390> about<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.690> i<00:03:48.930> guarantee<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.380> they<00:03:49.560> all

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
know about it i guarantee you they all

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.199 
know about it i guarantee you they all
know<00:03:49.800> about<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.160> they<00:03:50.280> just<00:03:50.490> know<00:03:50.610> there's

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
know about it they just know there's

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.730 
know about it they just know there's
ways<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.480> beat<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.930> that's<00:03:52.170> why<00:03:52.320> they<00:03:52.440> don't<00:03:52.560> do

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
ways to beat it that's why they don't do

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.620 
ways to beat it that's why they don't do
it<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.010> used<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.550> oh<00:03:53.760> I'm<00:03:54.390> doing

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
it I used to think oh I'm doing

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.540 
it I used to think oh I'm doing
something<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.530> don't<00:03:55.800> see<00:03:55.980> pro<00:03:56.130> gamers<00:03:56.430> do

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
something and I don't see pro gamers do

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.640 
something and I don't see pro gamers do
it<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:56.850> I've<00:03:57.150> invented<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.660> new<00:03:57.690> build<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.350> I'm

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
it so I've invented a new build and I'm

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.160 
it so I've invented a new build and I'm
go<00:03:59.490> soo<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.300> know<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.660> guarantee<00:04:01.110> you

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
go soo but you know I guarantee you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.510 
go soo but you know I guarantee you

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
to his main and natural probably also

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.089 
to his main and natural probably also
mined<00:05:14.510> out<00:05:14.599> now<00:05:14.720> serves<00:05:15.139> mine<00:05:15.380> their<00:05:15.919> main<00:05:16.070> a

natural<00:05:16.520> later<00:05:16.940> than<00:05:17.180> protestant<00:05:17.720> turn<00:05:17.840> so

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
natural later than protestant turn so

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.610 
natural later than protestant turn so
that's<00:05:18.919> why<00:05:19.070> i<00:05:19.160> assumed<00:05:19.699> that<00:05:19.970> he<00:05:20.180> had<00:05:20.620> that's

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
that's why i assumed that he had that's

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.140 
that's why i assumed that he had that's
why<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.800> assumed<00:05:22.250> he<00:05:22.340> had<00:05:22.370> four<00:05:22.610> bases<00:05:22.940> when<00:05:23.060> I

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
why I assumed he had four bases when I

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.999
