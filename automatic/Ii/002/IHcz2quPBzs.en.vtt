and so thus I've been going there all my
life<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.460> thought<00:01:59.880> about<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.509> was

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
life and I I thought about it when I was

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
life and I I thought about it when I was
riding<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.619> today<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:02.939> oh<00:02:03.060> there's<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
riding in today I was like oh there's a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.679 
riding in today I was like oh there's a
thrift<00:02:04.590> store<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.610> actually<00:02:06.030> run<00:02:06.210> by<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
thrift store and it's actually run by a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.010 
thrift store and it's actually run by a
Catholic<00:02:07.290> Church<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.099> community<00:02:09.020> but

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
Catholic Church in that community but

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.710 
Catholic Church in that community but
it's<00:02:10.140> right<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> middle

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
it's right in the middle

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.210 
it's right in the middle
so<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.319> ever<00:02:12.440> go<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.650> New<00:02:12.769> Braunfels<00:02:12.920> you
