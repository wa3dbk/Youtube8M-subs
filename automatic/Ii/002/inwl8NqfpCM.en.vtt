 hello youtube friends in this video you 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.790
 I will teach how to free ram memory 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.250
 a cell phone first of all I want to thank you 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.460
 that you are watching this video and I invite you 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.970
 to follow me on facebook and google + and 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.880
 on twitter if this video gives you something 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.919
 of value please give it a like and 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.449
 subscribe to my channel so that you are at 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.820
 stream of all the videos that go 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.369
 climbing for you 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.530
 thank you very much and I hope to see you always 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.090
 on my channel 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.960
 currently all cell phones or 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.760
 smartphones have ram memory and if not 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 you know what ram memory is for 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.360
 a cell phone I invite you to watch the video 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.489
 which is appearing at this moment 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.730
 as a link there I will explain to you why 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.860
 serves ram memory on a cell phone 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.900
 returning the subject of that video if the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.110
 RAM works based on a 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.879
 it is necessary to free it from time to time 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.210
 when for the performance of 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.430
 our cell phone is optimal for this is 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.170
 pretty simple that a smartphone like 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.180
 this one or like this one release and release your 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.910
 ram memory with the simple fact of 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.430
 turn it off and turn it back works 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.830
 like a computer the ram memory is 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.990
 a volatile memory that goes off or that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.060
 is cleaned is recycled every time 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.210
 we turn off the device and return it to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.550
 to learn is a memory as property 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.580
 of keeping ram memory that tends to 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.149
 erase your data and it must be like 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.860
 new 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.450
 every time we turn off the device and 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 we learn it again 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.920
 if we do that on a computer it 's the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.350
 same procedure on a cell phone in a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.079
 smartphone will be enough to turn off our 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.509
 device count if they want 30 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.700
 seconds or a minute to relearn it 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.640
 and you will see that ram memory will be 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.920
 released and this will result in your 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.039
 smartphone retires and will be faster 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.689
 will be faster when opening the 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.659
 applications when running the processes 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.629
 Etcetera is as simple as that 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.120
 release ram memory only it 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.530
 Get off the cell phone and go back and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.900
 turning it on again nothing more than that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.209
 Well, I hope this video has 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.459
 been useful for you put this practice into practice 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.260
 advice I give you and any questions
