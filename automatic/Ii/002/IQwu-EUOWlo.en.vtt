00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.500 
perform a buzzsaw fountain such as this
one<00:00:16.369> it's<00:00:17.369> not<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.699> difficult<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.150> move<00:00:18.359> to

interesting<00:00:20.220> things<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.970> using<00:00:21.420> planes

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
interesting things about using planes

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.019 
interesting things about using planes
that<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.800> kind<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.220> between<00:00:23.310> your<00:00:23.760> arms

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
that are kind of in between your arms

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
that are kind of in between your arms
rather<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.140> ones<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.439> normally<00:00:25.800> play

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
rather than the ones we normally play

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.279 
rather than the ones we normally play
with<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.180> sides<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.689> front<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> body

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to play with barrel rolls and love

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.780 
to play with barrel rolls and love
lacing<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.719> things<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.469> oh<00:00:37.649> right<00:00:38.070> so

lacing and things of that oh right so

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.410 
lacing and things of that oh right so
let's<00:00:39.090> let's<00:00:39.420> jump<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:42.000> actual

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
let's let's jump right in the actual

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720 
let's let's jump right in the actual
motion<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.410> around<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.160> feel<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
motion when going around I feel like is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880 
motion when going around I feel like is
inconsequential<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.350> happens<00:00:46.710> with

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
inconsequential to what happens with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
inconsequential to what happens with
your<00:00:47.039> hands<00:00:47.489> during<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> roll<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.110> that's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
your hands during the roll and that's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
your hands during the roll and that's
something<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.829> happen<00:00:50.039> even<00:00:50.760> before

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
something that can happen even before

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
something that can happen even before
you<00:00:51.329> start<00:00:51.660> getting<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.620> around<00:00:53.039> motion<00:00:53.489> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you start getting the around motion that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
you start getting the around motion that
you<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.149> hands<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you have in your hands and to get that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
you have in your hands and to get that
down<00:00:55.710> we're<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.460> play<00:00:56.969> around<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
down we're gonna play around with this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.410 
down we're gonna play around with this
concept<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.320> where<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.219> arms<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.120> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
concept of where your arms can be in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.770 
concept of where your arms can be in
terms<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.140> putting<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> poi<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.940> between<00:01:03.570> your

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
terms of putting the poi in between your

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
terms of putting the poi in between your
body<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.350> away<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.890> body<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
body or away from your body right so to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
body or away from your body right so to
start<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.890> gonna<00:01:07.979> play<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
start with we're gonna play in this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.550 
start with we're gonna play in this
buzzsaw<00:01:08.850> place<00:01:09.119> where<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.600> our<00:01:09.750> poi<00:01:10.049> turn

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
buzzsaw place where we have our poi turn

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280 
buzzsaw place where we have our poi turn
the<00:01:10.680> split<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.280> same<00:01:11.700> direction<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.900> between

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the split time same direction in between

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
the split time same direction in between
our<00:01:13.320> arms<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> would<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.060> as

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
our arms and what we would think of as

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.090 
our arms and what we would think of as
being<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.479> buzzsaw<00:01:15.720> plane<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.950> what

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
being a buzzsaw plane right and what

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.630 
being a buzzsaw plane right and what
that<00:01:17.250> means<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.030> both<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> poi<00:01:18.810> are

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
that means is that both of the poi are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
that means is that both of the poi are
rotating<00:01:20.640> half<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.060> their<00:01:21.299> beat<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.780> between

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
rotating half of their beat in between

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.030 
rotating half of their beat in between
our<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.729> arms<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.770> what<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:25.950> going

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
our two arms right and what we're going

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.560 
our two arms right and what we're going
to<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to want to do then is we're going to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200 
to want to do then is we're going to
want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.049> switch<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.549> our<00:01:29.700> arms<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
want to switch one of our arms to the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.100 
want to switch one of our arms to the
outside<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:32.009> arrangement<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
outside of this arrangement right so you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.450 
outside of this arrangement right so you
can<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.070> here

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can see it from here

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
can see it from here
my<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:36.720> right<00:01:36.900> hand<00:01:37.140> boy<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> still<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
my right my right hand boy is still in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.890 
my right my right hand boy is still in
the<00:01:37.979> frame<00:01:38.189> where<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:38.729> left<00:01:39.000> hand<00:01:39.210> boys<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the frame where my left hand boys on the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
the frame where my left hand boys on the
outside<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.520> we're<00:01:41.610> gonna<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
outside right and then we're gonna do a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.069 
outside right and then we're gonna do a
funky<00:01:42.240> thing<00:01:42.420> that's<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.659> feel<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> little

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
funky thing that's gonna feel a little

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.450 
funky thing that's gonna feel a little
bit<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> thread<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> needle<00:01:44.130> where

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
bit like it thread the needle where

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
bit like it thread the needle where
we're<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.320> switch<00:01:46.320> which<00:01:47.040> hand<00:01:47.340> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
we're going to switch which hand is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.719 
we're going to switch which hand is
forwards<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.040> look<00:01:50.399> at<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> from

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
forwards right so if you look at it from

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
forwards right so if you look at it from
this<00:01:50.939> angle<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.540> have<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.590> hand<00:01:52.799> inside

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this angle I have my right hand inside

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.789 
this angle I have my right hand inside
my<00:01:53.159> left<00:01:53.700> hand<00:01:53.909> outside<00:01:54.320> switch<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> my

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
my left hand outside switch it to my

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
my left hand outside switch it to my

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
yeah and then we're gonna complete this

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
yeah and then we're gonna complete this
part<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.630> movement<00:02:01.049> by<00:02:01.259> switching<00:02:01.890> my

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
part of the movement by switching my

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.160 
part of the movement by switching my
right<00:02:02.670> hand<00:02:02.909> poi<00:02:03.119> from<00:02:03.420> being<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> outside

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
right hand poi from being on the outside

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.310 
right hand poi from being on the outside
to<00:02:04.770> being<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> inside<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.079> doing

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to being on the inside so now I'm doing

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
to being on the inside so now I'm doing
a<00:02:07.530> post-assad<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:09.000> backwards

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
a post-assad that is going backwards

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470 
a post-assad that is going backwards
like<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.160> but<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.310> still<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.420> of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
like this but it's still in that kind of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.700 
like this but it's still in that kind of
place<00:02:12.690> where<00:02:13.170> I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
place where I

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.890 
place where I
have<00:02:13.800> both<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.430> my<00:02:14.610> poyo<00:02:14.970> tating<00:02:15.510> between<00:02:15.780> my

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
have both of my poyo tating between my

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
have both of my poyo tating between my
arms<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.070> back<00:02:17.310> we're<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.030> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
arms to get back we're just going to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.270 
arms to get back we're just going to
reverse<00:02:18.360> these<00:02:18.600> steps<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.650> I'm<00:02:19.890> gonna<00:02:20.010> go

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280

this is just a matter of practicing

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.600 
this is just a matter of practicing
going<00:03:12.780> back<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.110> forth<00:03:13.350> with<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.650> think

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.540 
left right right right left left left
right<00:03:19.500> right<00:03:19.890> right<00:03:20.630> left<00:03:21.630> left<00:03:21.870> yeah<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.950> you

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
right right right left left yeah and you

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.070 
right right right left left yeah and you
try<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:23.880> do<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:24.210> continuous<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.990> as

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
try and do it as continuous and as

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.350 
try and do it as continuous and as
quickly<00:03:25.290> as<00:03:25.500> possible<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:26.880> go<00:03:27.030> left

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
quickly as possible so you just go left

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.340 
quickly as possible so you just go left
right<00:03:27.690> right

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
right right

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.200 
right right
you<00:03:28.920> get<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> downbeat<00:03:29.490> with<00:03:29.640> each<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:30.000> right

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
you get a downbeat with each one right

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.250 
you get a downbeat with each one right
so<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.990> first<00:03:31.260> one<00:03:31.500> goes<00:03:31.710> out<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.580> out<00:03:33.260> out

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so the first one goes out out in out out

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.620 
so the first one goes out out in out out
in<00:03:34.320> out<00:03:35.090> out<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.390> out<00:03:37.010> out<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.420> just<00:03:39.420> like<00:03:39.570> that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
in out out in out out in just like that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.990 
in out out in out out in just like that
right<00:03:39.990> and<00:03:40.310> again<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.430> want<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.610> practice

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
right and again you want to practice

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.910 
right and again you want to practice
this<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.240> that<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:43.020> do<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.290> say<00:03:43.470> ten<00:03:43.680> times

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
this so that you can do it say ten times

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.440 
this so that you can do it say ten times
in<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> row<00:03:44.280> without<00:03:44.550> hitting<00:03:44.760> yourself<00:03:45.000> like

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
in a row without hitting yourself like

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.660 
in a row without hitting yourself like
we'll<00:03:46.380> call<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.710> one<00:03:47.270> two<00:03:48.740> three<00:03:50.060> four<00:03:51.380> five

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
we'll call it one two three four five

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.990 
we'll call it one two three four five
six<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:54.990> forth<00:03:55.230> right<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:56.000> you'll

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
six so on and so forth right and you'll

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
through this motion but the great news

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.120 
through this motion but the great news
is<00:05:04.180> is<00:05:04.570> that<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> hard<00:05:05.139> part<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.560> doing<00:05:05.949> this

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
is is that a hard part of doing this

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.279 
is is that a hard part of doing this
that<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.789> knowing<00:05:07.300> when<00:05:07.539> to<00:05:07.570> do<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:07.960> with<00:05:08.110> one
