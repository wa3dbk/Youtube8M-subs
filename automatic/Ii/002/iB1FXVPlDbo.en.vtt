and open raised the top seventy percent

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.020 
and open raised the top seventy percent
now<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:57.229> can<00:00:57.500> see<00:00:57.710> how<00:00:57.860> villain<00:00:58.220> reacts<00:00:58.729> on<00:00:58.879> my

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.770 
range but yeah always with the nuts okay
let's<00:02:09.590> look<00:02:09.770> at<00:02:09.950> another<00:02:10.160> feature<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:11.030> have

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
let's look at another feature I have

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.869 
let's look at another feature I have
noticed<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.290> villain<00:02:12.650> open<00:02:12.980> raised<00:02:13.220> two

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
noticed that villain open raised two

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.070 
noticed that villain open raised two
very<00:02:14.150> different<00:02:14.629> bed<00:02:14.780> sizes<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.860> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
very different bed sizes and now I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.890 
very different bed sizes and now I
want<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:17.070> i<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.210> bet<00:02:18.420> sizing

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
want to see if i can get a bet sizing

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.170 
want to see if i can get a bet sizing
read<00:02:19.110> i<00:02:19.380> returned<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> menu<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.940> sets

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
read i returned to the menu and sets

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.230 
read i returned to the menu and sets
interval<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.110> aggregating<00:02:22.740> bed<00:02:23.310> sizes<00:02:23.610> 20

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
interval for aggregating bed sizes 20

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.830 
interval for aggregating bed sizes 20
let's<00:02:25.110> open<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> tree<00:02:25.830> where<00:02:26.760> william<00:02:27.120> optum

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
let's open the tree where william optum

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.410 
let's open the tree where william optum
raises<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.310> see<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.090> different

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
raises and here we can see the different

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.890 
raises and here we can see the different
open<00:02:30.690> bra<00:02:30.840> sizes<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.760> frequencies<00:02:32.900> yeah

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
open bra sizes and frequencies yeah

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.620 
open bra sizes and frequencies yeah
maybe<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.560> too<00:02:34.590> detailed<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.460> will<00:02:36.360> set

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
maybe this is too detailed I will set

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.080 
maybe this is too detailed I will set
the<00:02:36.780> interval<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:40.800> eight<00:02:41.490> percent<00:02:41.910> he

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the interval to one in eight percent he

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.080 
the interval to one in eight percent he
raises<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.690> two<00:02:43.470> big<00:02:43.710> blinds<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.640> fifty<00:02:44.940> two

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
raises to two big blinds in fifty two

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.600 
raises to two big blinds in fifty two
percent<00:02:45.120> he<00:02:46.080> raises<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.890> three<00:02:47.130> big<00:02:47.370> blinds

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
percent he raises up to three big blinds

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.230 
percent he raises up to three big blinds
and<00:02:47.940> he<00:02:48.240> follows<00:02:48.630> forty<00:02:48.960> percent<00:02:49.320> in<00:02:50.240> this

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
and he follows forty percent in this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.900 
and he follows forty percent in this
range<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.020> can<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.650> villains<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.640> be<00:02:53.790> be

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
range we can see that villains to be be

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.449 
range we can see that villains to be be
open<00:02:54.270> raising<00:02:54.600> range<00:02:54.840> see<00:02:55.440> seems<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.160> kept

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
open raising range see seems to be kept

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.620 
open raising range see seems to be kept
to<00:02:56.760> something<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.350> yeah<00:02:58.350> s9<00:02:58.920> absurd<00:02:59.630> another

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
to something like yeah s9 absurd another

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.570 
to something like yeah s9 absurd another
interesting<00:03:00.870> point<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.680> his<00:03:01.860> open<00:03:02.220> raising

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
interesting point was his open raising

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.240 
interesting point was his open raising
range<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:03.300> yeah<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.530> even<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:04.950> he<00:03:05.070> folds

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
range this yeah that even if he folds

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.220 
range this yeah that even if he folds
forty<00:03:05.670> percent<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:06.570> are<00:03:06.690> still<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> lot<00:03:07.080> of

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
forty percent there are still a lot of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.490 
forty percent there are still a lot of
hands<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.770> his<00:03:08.220> bottom<00:03:08.610> forty<00:03:08.850> percent

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
hands of his bottom forty percent

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.680 
hands of his bottom forty percent
included<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.650> his<00:03:10.770> open<00:03:11.130> raising<00:03:11.490> range<00:03:11.700> this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
included in his open raising range this

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.600 
included in his open raising range this
means<00:03:12.959> he's<00:03:13.170> playing<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.590> mixed<00:03:13.920> prefab<00:03:14.310> spread
