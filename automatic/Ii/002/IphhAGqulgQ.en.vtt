00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.840 
cinematography the kind of clothing the
attitude<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.769> that's<00:04:19.769> going<00:04:19.980> on<00:04:20.160> now<00:04:20.220> on<00:04:20.670> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
attitude like that's going on now on the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.360 
attitude like that's going on now on the
ground<00:04:21.120> that's<00:04:21.540> not<00:04:21.989> really<00:04:22.500> in<00:04:22.680> exposed<00:04:23.100> that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
ground that's not really in exposed that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.080 
ground that's not really in exposed that
much<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:24.060> gaming<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.870> kind<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.950> revamp<00:04:26.760> that

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
much in gaming and kind of revamp that

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.540 
much in gaming and kind of revamp that
but<00:04:27.810> keep<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.260> essence<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.070> kind<00:04:29.520> of

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
but keep the essence that the kind of

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.540 
but keep the essence that the kind of
the<00:04:29.670> magic<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> gameplay<00:04:30.630> alive

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
the magic of the gameplay alive

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.640 
the magic of the gameplay alive
basically<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.670> allows<00:04:32.760> us<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.330> kind<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.690> change

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
basically it allows us to kind of change

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.410 
basically it allows us to kind of change
the<00:04:34.830> expectations<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.640> what<00:04:35.700> he<00:04:35.970> can<00:04:36.120> do<00:04:36.270> in

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
the expectations of what he can do in

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.210 
the expectations of what he can do in
terms<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.720> even<00:04:37.170> gameplay<00:04:37.560> wise<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:38.100> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
terms of even gameplay wise like the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.040 
terms of even gameplay wise like the
moves<00:04:38.460> he<00:04:38.640> has<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.060> everything<00:04:39.270> we're

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
moves he has and everything we're

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.450 
moves he has and everything we're
starting<00:04:40.440> from<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.980> beginning<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:43.460> it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
starting from the beginning and it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.520 
starting from the beginning and it
affords<00:04:44.880> us<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.900> something<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.320> we

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
affords us it's something that we

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.920 
affords us it's something that we
decided<00:04:46.950> with<00:04:47.310> Capcom<00:04:47.820> that<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.390> was<00:04:48.540> us<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.780> lot

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
decided with Capcom that it was us a lot

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.159 
decided with Capcom that it was us a lot
of<00:04:49.050> creative<00:04:50.210> freedom<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.240> explore<00:04:51.660> things<00:04:51.990> in

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
of creative freedom to explore things in

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.360 
of creative freedom to explore things in
the<00:04:52.260> story<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.560> maybe<00:04:52.980> haven't<00:04:53.310> been

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
the story that maybe haven't been

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.140 
the story that maybe haven't been
explained<00:04:53.850> about<00:04:54.090> his<00:04:54.240> origin

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
explained about his origin

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.030 
explained about his origin
the<00:04:57.150> idea<00:04:57.510> with<00:04:57.840> any<00:04:58.050> reboot<00:04:58.440> as<00:04:58.650> you've<00:04:58.830> seen

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
the idea with any reboot as you've seen

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.860 
the idea with any reboot as you've seen
we<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.430> plenty<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.000> meaningful<00:05:00.450> templates

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
we have plenty of meaningful templates

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.140 
we have plenty of meaningful templates
and<00:05:01.110> both<00:05:01.710> film<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.160> TV<00:05:02.340> about<00:05:02.760> how<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:02.970> go

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
and both film and TV about how to go

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.850 
and both film and TV about how to go
about<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.390> we're<00:05:04.260> leveraging<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.830> a

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
about that we're leveraging and a

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.530 
about that we're leveraging and a
massive<00:05:05.340> amount<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.760> existing<00:05:06.180> cannon

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
massive amount of the existing cannon

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.710 
massive amount of the existing cannon
obviously<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.260> sort<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:08.360> replacing<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.510> in

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
obviously but sort of replacing it in

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.810 
obviously but sort of replacing it in
this<00:05:09.870> current<00:05:10.380> cultural<00:05:10.980> context<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.580> we're

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
this current cultural context that we're

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.940 
this current cultural context that we're
in<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.420> so<00:05:12.660> it's<00:05:12.930> sort<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.140> essential<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.770> have

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
in and so it's sort of essential to have

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.760 
in and so it's sort of essential to have
our<00:05:14.130> partners<00:05:14.430> in<00:05:14.640> Japan<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.300> let<00:05:16.170> us<00:05:16.260> know<00:05:16.470> and

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
our partners in Japan to let us know and

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.080 
our partners in Japan to let us know and
we're<00:05:16.920> getting<00:05:17.100> too<00:05:17.370> far<00:05:17.580> from<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.880> tether

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
we're getting too far from the tether

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:26.290 
we're getting too far from the tether
point<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.750> understand<00:05:19.320> what<00:05:19.980> to<00:05:20.070> respect

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.480
