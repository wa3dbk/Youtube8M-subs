00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.830
 this is so coach ne of Marc Arnold 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:15.599
 cellar in the market and freiburg fc 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:19.439
 I meticulous smart work because 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.430
 if you are completely honest, okay 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.880
 not in the second league right now 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.439
 every day on the way 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 I know players because knows him from the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 youth from the south of stuttgart and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.920
 but that's not how they are 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 not so well known i would go without it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 to kick emotionally 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 Some people here would not do all that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.329
 eleven know and braunschweig 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.320
 maybe not even 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:54.390
 with sex that i have about good 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.969
 transfer policy collects picks 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.449
 Brunswick football took place 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.680
 no question the people come now only 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.969
 running average is the ouch but 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.290
 if it is going well, it is relatively normal 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.360
 football instead of this hungry for 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.580
 football like crazy and it's all 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.549
 very very good and thoughtful and makes 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.460
 then on the 17th place only the single 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.280
 go out for braunschweig on fabrics 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.299
 she looks so i do not happen to have i 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.009
 the power I have the discipline 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.700
 everything tight the border not always 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.310
 footballing that is not always synonymous 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.049
 You always have the means to do that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.509
 no football fireworks ever but that 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.900
 I'm an incredibly dense one 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.700
 story that you go there and therefore 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.700
 I have so much success 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.470
 everything follows exactly in this form 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.280
 and then look better in the end though 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.220
 industry better 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.220
 then they deserve it against 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.130
 not a millimeter space left and not 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.720
 just come to the idea well there can 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.500
 the 200s are standing the get the ball 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.500
 in the there because then loses
