00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.649
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.830
 a new series of mine namely 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.880
 pokÃ©mon arts academy 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.760
 yes and we'll just keep clicking 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.199
 Of course I'm a girl too 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.779
 Unfortunately I have to admit that I am 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.720
 left-handed belong to a rare 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 species 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.719
 why do not I honestly do that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:36.719
 So it could actually start and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.380
 if you are curious about what is on 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.380
 come to me 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.570
 well I give it to my other times give 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.570
 But it's my youtube name 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.970
 Greetings like that 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.530
 ok then I'll get a great one 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.530
 ID card 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 candidate 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 Super 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.150
 usd looks awful but is yes 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.150
 no matter 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.110
 well i start i like lynn was totally 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.200
 like to have it started then 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.820
 and that's why I want it right out 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.310
 besides, I like penguins like some of them 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.860
 you probably already know because 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.190
 I like to love penguins 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:26.880
 I just like to find them cute and cuddly 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:39.270
 good introductory exercise helps good tip 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:41.100
 Okay we should do that 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.370
 my circles are always incredibly difficult 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:50.000
 but okay he left him okay for 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000
 undone 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:04.010
 well then we paint one 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.410
 beautiful circle is just me 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.710
 So it's hard to do it halfway round 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:16.240
 that's okay or 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:19.220
 Next step on was the two large 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:31.250
 I think it will be difficult for me 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:40.640
 At least okay, I can be there 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:47.030
 kind of like that, then we want 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:49.270
 Here are a beautiful choice things so 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.470
 we do this page thing yes 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:01.010
 beautiful cheek gets ours 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:04.670
 our plan was and here one more 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.180
 make it a little bit nicer and you're done 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.209
 is the beautiful penguin animal 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.470
 Beautify it a bit further here 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:20.390
 yes it is not symmetrical it is not 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:24.070
 but good one says yes so ok and 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:30.370
 next yes I want to continue 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:33.530
 is quite okay krombach yes good 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.430
 Well, that should be 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.430
 be easy 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:50.330
 ok then so here and it still after 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.790
 below also here and paint in the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.470
 hand it somehow running on the 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.850
 the control cross on it feels that way 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.770
 bit weird if you with cash 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.560
 is certainly similar for right-handed people 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.750
 with the with the little buttons on the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.960
 right side with the crown I am 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.960
 satisfied 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:13.880
 looks quite good for the beginning 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.260
 the beak good simple circle i 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.650
 I guess I'll make it to the circle 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.650
 to paint 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.200
 so here and above a bit 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:31.190
 wonder it's perfect 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.720
 beautiful circle I'm almost 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.610
 Proud looks so pretty with these 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.580
 The two times with this pastel thing 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.810
 for the eyes and a fine line around 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.810
 to define the beak 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:59.780
 We'll do it that way here 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.940
 a beautiful eye is usually it 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.550
 with me so that the left eye better 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.690
 looks like the right one 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.690
 I do not know if you know that too 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.960
 nice to paint 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.380
 Now I have destroyed Germany this 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.690
 one eye is a bit me now 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.310
 round 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:27.310
 well and smile 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:31.120
 better than nothing 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:34.919
 next step i'm just looking forward to it 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:39.669
 well shine in the eyes 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:43.150
 alright, I have somehow in the upper right corner 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:45.300
 such a little bit know it would have 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.719
 actually should not be there 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:53.439
 I stick together someday or something 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:57.819
 so beautiful glanzlichter thought you 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:07:00.849
 not the pupil but more solid 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:06.939
 circle on the top right now has moment 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:13.449
 that's why it's happening now 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:15.039
 somehow my blind one was straight 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:19.889
 strange I suppose I'm here 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.889
 somehow come up with the hand of 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.389
 I was so proud of my plans 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.880
 the front looks like this 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:38.740
 I have no idea somehow gone 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:42.750
 I do not want to know how 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:49.360
 this naked blind beautiful 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:54.539
 We continue to reject that we want 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:57.430
 do not finish 

00:07:54.539 --> 00:08:00.220
 so that was it with the very first part of the 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.560
 tutorial and we'll see you the second one 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.880
