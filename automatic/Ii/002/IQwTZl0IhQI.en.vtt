now I get man to keep the cat me gone
for<00:02:39.860> big<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.340> kite<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.880> moves

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
for big as the kite is it moves

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.440 
for big as the kite is it moves
surprisingly<00:02:41.570> well<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.790> didn't<00:02:44.210> back

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
surprisingly well and it didn't back

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.710 
surprisingly well and it didn't back
stall<00:02:44.840> amazing<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.310> way<00:02:46.370> back<00:02:46.580> stall<00:02:46.910> look

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
stall amazing I that way back stall look

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.200 
stall amazing I that way back stall look
at<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.960> still<00:02:48.260> there<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:49.210> think<00:02:50.210> it<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:51.310> maybe<00:02:52.310> 10

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
at it still there I think it is maybe 10

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.700 
at it still there I think it is maybe 10
knots<00:02:53.560> maybe<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.240> lucky<00:02:56.540> side

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
knots maybe on that on the lucky side

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:09.250 
knots maybe on that on the lucky side
closer<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.890> 9<00:02:58.100> I<00:03:07.360> tried<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.510> infinity

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
closer to 9 I tried the infinity

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.130 
closer to 9 I tried the infinity
I<00:03:09.290> tried<00:03:10.010> infinity<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:11.450> barely<00:03:11.750> hear<00:03:12.020> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
I tried infinity I can barely hear the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.320 
I tried infinity I can barely hear the
wind<00:03:12.320> in<00:03:12.410> my<00:03:12.440> ears<00:03:12.709> can<00:03:13.489> barely<00:03:13.910> hear<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.150> wind

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
wind in my ears can barely hear the wind

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.960 
wind in my ears can barely hear the wind
and<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.540> kite<00:03:14.720> still<00:03:14.989> stay<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.290> there<00:03:15.440> the
