bringing<00:04:28.820> anything<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.450> table<00:04:29.690> that<00:04:30.170> all

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
bringing anything to the table that all

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.400 
bringing anything to the table that all
the<00:04:31.130> tracks<00:04:31.460> before<00:04:31.790> those<00:04:32.330> tracks<00:04:32.750> didn't

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
the tracks before those tracks didn't

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.870 
the tracks before those tracks didn't
already<00:04:33.680> bring<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.190> this<00:04:34.400> next<00:04:34.610> thing<00:04:34.820> I

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
already bring and this next thing I

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.660 
already bring and this next thing I
can't<00:04:35.330> really<00:04:35.450> explain<00:04:35.840> I'm<00:04:36.170> not<00:04:36.680> sure<00:04:36.950> why<00:04:37.160> it

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
can't really explain I'm not sure why it

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.370 
can't really explain I'm not sure why it
could<00:04:37.880> have<00:04:38.060> something<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.510> do<00:04:38.630> with<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:39.230> way

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
could have something to do with the way

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.890 
could have something to do with the way
these<00:04:39.500> guys<00:04:39.680> recorded<00:04:40.280> this<00:04:40.400> album<00:04:40.670> but<00:04:41.360> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
these guys recorded this album but the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.220 
these guys recorded this album but the
grooves<00:04:42.260> on<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.890> LP<00:04:43.100> just<00:04:43.520> feel<00:04:43.760> really<00:04:44.230> flat

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
grooves on this LP just feel really flat

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.660 
grooves on this LP just feel really flat
for<00:04:45.620> me<00:04:45.740> I'm<00:04:45.830> not<00:04:45.950> really<00:04:46.070> feeling<00:04:46.370> any

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
for me I'm not really feeling any

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.570 
for me I'm not really feeling any
interplay<00:04:47.420> or<00:04:47.800> interaction<00:04:48.800> with<00:04:48.950> the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
interplay or interaction with the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.270 
interplay or interaction with the
keyboards<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.330> guitars<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.530> drums<00:04:51.890> the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
keyboards the guitars and the drums the

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.770 
keyboards the guitars and the drums the
momentum<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.300> kind<00:04:53.450> of<00:04:53.510> feels<00:04:53.720> like<00:04:55.780> this

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
momentum just kind of feels like this

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.540 
momentum just kind of feels like this
doesn't<00:04:57.110> really<00:04:57.230> feel<00:04:57.470> like<00:04:57.530> I'm<00:04:58.010> hearing<00:04:58.460> a

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
doesn't really feel like I'm hearing a

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.720 
doesn't really feel like I'm hearing a
full<00:04:58.850> band<00:04:59.150> playing<00:04:59.960> together<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:01.280> know<00:05:01.460> I

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.060 
full band playing together you know I
could<00:05:02.090> be<00:05:02.210> wrong<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.170> I'm<00:05:03.290> open<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.860> that

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
could be wrong and and I'm open to that

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.270 
could be wrong and and I'm open to that
but<00:05:04.520> still<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.420> climaxes<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.890> jams

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
but still the the climaxes and the jams

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.310 
but still the the climaxes and the jams

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
I'm just not really getting anything out

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
of hearing them go on for an extended

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.580 
of hearing them go on for an extended
period<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.630> time<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:11.870> just<00:05:12.020> got<00:05:12.260> to<00:05:12.350> feel<00:05:12.470> like

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
period of time I just got to feel like

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.130 
period of time I just got to feel like
I'm<00:05:12.710> hearing<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.040> same<00:05:13.390> thing<00:05:14.390> over<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.020> over
