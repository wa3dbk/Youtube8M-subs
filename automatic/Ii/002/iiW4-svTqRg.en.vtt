00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.180
 cross with heart continue with the 50th 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.400
 days trend welcome to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.830
 weekend weather with the 15 days trend 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 greet god when the weather is exciting 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.610
 What in the next two weeks 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 Let's pass this heat wave Monday 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.119
 until wednesday maybe thursday though 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.270
 then it is through again 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859
 the next sheep's cold comes so much more 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.810
 and of course the question is how hot 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.980
 now this heat wave will be 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 There were already these again 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 dramatic messages from the department 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.050
 I guess now I even my I 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.149
 can also lose against the times 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 full post department but it is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 been written 39 40 degrees 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 I suspect that it will not be so hot 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 As I said, it is as always 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.039
 competition and the great weather 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 will see soon you will see who 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.680
 In the end, I believe that the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 Nearby limit is 30 to 35 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 grad maybe a few 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.949
 bit over it but 39 to 40 degrees can 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.800
 I do not imagine at the moment 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.539
 for quite different reasons, the air mass 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 in height and therefore is this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.990
 alarm mood with some that is in the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 did record-breaking 1500 meters so 22 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.869
 until 23 maybe even 24 degrees 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 and that's usually enough for 39 40 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.650
 down below 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
 but in this special weather situation 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 I just see the possibility that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 again and again cloud clouds in the height 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.979
 there are the sunshine then 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 dampen 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.200
 on the other hand also the possibility because it 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.020
 just as humid air is then comes too 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640
 mostly not the full booms down 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.950
 because very quickly again 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 you have to form clouds of cloud too 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 Imagine is in the south wind and south 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.860
 then shoot in the alps already in the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.770
 maybe even on tuesday 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.780
 Monday even high and diesel high 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.540
 those on the bus wanted to pull the clouds 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.159
 then also direction north way too 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.619
 a possibility that can take place 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.530
 because it is such an elongated south facing 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.259
 is from North Africa up to us just 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.480
 sahara dust or saharan dust i know 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.020
 not so down sarah usually continue 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.930
 somehow come up to us and then 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.850
 the sunshine also spoils this 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.720
 are now considering why I am now 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.720
 at 35 36 degrees or so as a general 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.790
 many come only 30 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.890
 grad and a bit over it 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.500
 Anyway, north will not work anyway 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.720
 However, that gets so dramatically hot 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.030
 is the advantage of the people with the 39 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.090
 Roared 40 degrees room 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.740
 it is as already mentioned a humid 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.720
 be a matter of course 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.430
 and after all the cool weather the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.370
 It will be easy 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.170
 animal hot and sultry 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.210
 not because of the numbers you pay on the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.100
 thermometer has but simply because it 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.920
 it's just gay and that's why 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.750
 feel a bit hoarse than that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.820
 finally on the thermometer too 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.310
 will see 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.960
 Let's take a look at the matter for 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.240
 Northern Germany that's it now 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.560
 Example Hamburg 15 days trend up here 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.570
 the heat record is that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.000
 average for the yes-side 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.800
 cold record you can see that too 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.060
 a little uncertain how much the 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.650
 Hot air is ever after 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.060
 Northern Germany has to get ahead 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.640
 now in the next days in the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.440
 view detail 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.050
 on facebook slash tile man 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.580
 weather or twitter j &amp; j underlined 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.480
 Tachelmann see each one the last 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.030
 was standing 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.130
 if we go south Germany 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.600
 and Switzerland 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.340
 also here to see the same picture we 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.320
 are here with the air mass here 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.020
 safe southern Germany and in the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.550
 Switzerland in the range of the record values â€‹â€‹the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.670
 one from the last sixty seventy 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.620
 years know in height but what too 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.510
 very safe is then with thursday 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.970
 then it is over then it goes back 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.190
 on average probably 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.020
 very likely even 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.290
 below average temperatures for 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.080
 swiss and swiss where it is 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.709
 possible agreements easier or it 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.250
 hot switzerland means sales 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.830
 Degree 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.050
 but I do not necessarily believe that we 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.680
 40 or as long as that gets pretty fast 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.180
 kiedrich and it has become the dust in 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.040
 the air and it probably has 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.349
 Borrow probably for the b 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.389
 but it becomes the relative typical 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:23.979
 equality with a degree of operation 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:26.340
 therefore all the cold what is there 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:33.729
 not and most sweat in the tram 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:36.460
 and all or a lot of unpleasant feeling 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.370
 has before then again from mid april 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.009
 although an art especially with 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.940
 global europe is not that 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:48.460
 temperature not below 20 degrees 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.370
 the picture for vienna is actually quite 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.070
 similarly representative becomes the eastern one 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.460
 Austria here, too, this great heat 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.740
 tip here probably more like that 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.810
 near 35 as near by 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.210
 40 degrees and then here 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.400
 this uncertainty when it's over 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.009
 when is the cooler air of 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.630
 it is then interspersed again west 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.070
 maybe thursday or maybe 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.139
 take a little longer 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.099
 that is the uncertainty in vienna where it is 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.199
 Of course always a bit longer 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.900
 can go from west to west then 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.970
 cooler air comes in as I said if 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.380
 you want to enjoy the summer and up 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.260
 have been waiting for him 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.539
 It takes place mainly Monday through Wednesday 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.039
 partly even thursday instead of and 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.960
 but then it is the next 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.419
 weekend back in time 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.289
 a nice weekend everything good and 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.289
 again praised briefly
