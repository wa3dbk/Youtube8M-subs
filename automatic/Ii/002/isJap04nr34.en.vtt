00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 despite the common demand 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.509
 19 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.309
 result 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.309
 because the player knows what happens 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 did you see that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.489
 this is weird 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.489
 have you ever wondered how it was against this decision? 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.470
 is curious to know how they are on the streets 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.690
 was chosen to become 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.690
 the judges have plans for you this year 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.530
 some feel that they can not give assurance 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.120
 to destroy the world 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.270
 time changes everything 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 you have to protect 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.940
 who knows these demons 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 we started explaining so quickly 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.300
 therefore it is not a region 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300
 is the only place where the demand over the residence 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 on the line beyond this year 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 You love to talk what I should do. 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.090
 but in luck 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 home or 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 ran to save as yet undisclosed 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 he said that you remember having a relationship that we made 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.570
 you 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.020
 lost 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.270
 this is the moment 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 art 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.690
 the one is accurate
