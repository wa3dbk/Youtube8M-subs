its commitment to the community you know
if<00:00:32.450> I<00:00:32.509> think<00:00:32.720> of<00:00:32.810> Simon<00:00:32.990> Fraser<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.470> think<00:00:33.890> this

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
if I think of Simon Fraser I think this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.370 
if I think of Simon Fraser I think this
is<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.310> university<00:00:34.940> which<00:00:35.240> now<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.050> certainly

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
is a university which now but certainly

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.040 
is a university which now but certainly
in<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.560> future<00:00:36.890> can<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.150> should<00:00:38.329> be<00:00:38.390> known<00:00:38.720> as

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
in the future can and should be known as

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.830 
in the future can and should be known as
a<00:00:39.590> university<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.820> not<00:00:41.150> only<00:00:41.330> thinking

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
a university that is not only thinking

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.290 
a university that is not only thinking
of<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.080> world<00:00:42.310> which<00:00:43.310> I<00:00:43.460> know<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:43.760> its<00:00:43.940> logo

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
of the world which I know is its logo

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.720 
of the world which I know is its logo
and<00:00:45.110> not<00:00:45.260> only<00:00:45.350> connected<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.220> world<00:00:46.340> as

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
and not only connected to the world as

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.900 
and not only connected to the world as
it<00:00:46.880> most<00:00:47.090> assuredly<00:00:47.270> is<00:00:47.990> in<00:00:48.410> terms<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.880> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
it most assuredly is in terms of the the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.330 
it most assuredly is in terms of the the
connection<00:00:50.810> it<00:00:50.930> has<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.040> local

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
connection it has to to the local

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.760 
connection it has to to the local
community<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:52.940> also<00:00:52.970> internationally<00:00:53.840> but

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
community but also internationally but

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.740 
community but also internationally but
it's<00:00:54.920> also<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.250> university<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:56.210> think<00:00:56.570> is

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's also a university that I think is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.280 
it's also a university that I think is
and<00:00:57.320> should<00:00:57.740> be<00:00:57.800> known<00:00:58.160> by<00:00:58.460> by<00:00:59.150> by<00:00:59.540> staff<00:00:59.870> by

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
and should be known by by by staff by

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.080 
and should be known by by by staff by
faculty<00:01:00.860> but<00:01:01.040> certainly<00:01:01.370> by<00:01:01.460> its<00:01:01.700> students

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
faculty but certainly by its students

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.310 
faculty but certainly by its students
and<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.270> communities<00:01:02.630> it<00:01:02.750> serves<00:01:02.780> as<00:01:03.260> the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
and the communities it serves as the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.429 
and the communities it serves as the
best<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.250> all<00:01:04.369> possible<00:01:04.430> worlds<00:01:04.970> in<00:01:05.479> terms<00:01:06.259> of

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
best of all possible worlds in terms of

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.080 
best of all possible worlds in terms of
what<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.710> can<00:01:06.830> provide<00:01:07.189> for<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.549> future<00:01:07.880> I

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
what it can provide for the future I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.210 
what it can provide for the future I
think<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.840> role<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.020> university<00:01:09.619> president

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
think the role of university president

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.990 
think the role of university president
is<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.880> support<00:01:11.800> those<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.460> university

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
is to support those in the university

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.480 
is to support those in the university
community<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.720> draw<00:01:15.170> out<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.800> institution

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
community to draw out of the institution

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.720 
community to draw out of the institution
the<00:01:17.300> very<00:01:17.510> best<00:01:17.870> of<00:01:18.140> what<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:18.950> can<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.220> wants

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
the very best of what it can and wants

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.149 
the very best of what it can and wants

to be and thankfully in Simon Fraser
there<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:22.909> much<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.830> has<00:01:24.830> already<00:01:25.010> been

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
there is so much that has already been

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.670 
there is so much that has already been
drawn<00:01:25.610> out<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.150> hope<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.930> be<00:01:27.110> able<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.530> add

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
drawn out and I hope to be able to add

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.010 
drawn out and I hope to be able to add
to<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.070> two<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.060> strongest<00:01:29.390> views<00:01:29.840> I

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
to that two of the strongest views I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.790 
to that two of the strongest views I
hold<00:01:30.290> one<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.300> commitment<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.350> education

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
hold one is a commitment to education

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.320 
hold one is a commitment to education
and<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.190> belief<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.730> value<00:01:34.760> of<00:01:35.210> education

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
and the belief in the value of education

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.660 
and the belief in the value of education
it's<00:01:36.080> transformative<00:01:36.800> potential<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.520> what

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
it's transformative potential and what

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.800 
it's transformative potential and what
it<00:01:37.760> can<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:38.090> for<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:39.440> community<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:40.540> well<00:01:41.540> as<00:01:41.690> for

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it can do for a community as well as for

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.420 
it can do for a community as well as for
the<00:01:41.930> individuals<00:01:42.440> in<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.740> community<00:01:42.920> and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
the individuals in that community and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.760 
the individuals in that community and
the<00:01:43.970> second<00:01:44.330> belief<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.200> all<00:01:45.500> work

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
the second belief is that we all work

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.010 
the second belief is that we all work
much<00:01:46.100> better<00:01:46.130> when<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:47.210> work<00:01:47.390> together<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
much better when we work together and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.810 
much better when we work together and
when<00:01:48.800> there's<00:01:48.979> diversity<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.520> views

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
when there's diversity of views

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.060 
when there's diversity of views
strengthened<00:01:50.570> diversity<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.500> ability<00:01:52.040> of

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
strengthened diversity the ability of

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.440 
strengthened diversity the ability of
people<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.490> come<00:01:52.729> together<00:01:52.909> with<00:01:53.270> different

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
people to come together with different

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.960 
people to come together with different
points<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.080> view<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:55.159> work<00:01:55.310> together<00:01:55.520> is

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
points of view and to work together is

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.330 
points of view and to work together is
so<00:01:56.299> much<00:01:56.510> greater<00:01:56.720> than<00:01:57.229> any<00:01:57.620> one<00:01:57.920> person's

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
so much greater than any one person's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.860 
so much greater than any one person's
point<00:01:58.549> of<00:01:58.670> view<00:01:58.729> including<00:01:59.690> may<00:01:59.810> be

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
point of view including may be

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.050 
point of view including may be
particularly<00:02:00.350> my<00:02:00.799> own<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.729> think<00:02:01.940> I've

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
particularly my own and I think I've

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.580 
particularly my own and I think I've
shown<00:02:02.090> in<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:02.600> roles<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.900> I've<00:02:03.110> had<00:02:03.350> an

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
shown in the roles that I've had an

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.280 
shown in the roles that I've had an
ability<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.700> work<00:02:04.909> in<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:05.450> way<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.750> harness

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
ability to work in that way to harness

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.339 
ability to work in that way to harness
the<00:02:06.950> differences<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.729> work<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.959> common

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
the differences and to work in common

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.530 
the differences and to work in common
cause<00:02:09.530> i<00:02:09.920> think<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.640> other<00:02:10.700> port<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.180> role<00:02:11.330> is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
cause i think the other port and role is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.660 
cause i think the other port and role is
to<00:02:11.569> be<00:02:11.810> representative<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.040> university
