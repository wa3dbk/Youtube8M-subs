going good anyway man I made a mistake

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.049 
going good anyway man I made a mistake
right<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.250> didn't<00:00:14.549> get<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> capture

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
right there I didn't get the capture

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.640 
right there I didn't get the capture
points<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> which<00:00:15.809> are<00:00:15.990> equivalent<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.379> one

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
points for a which are equivalent to one

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.890 
points for a which are equivalent to one
kill<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.730> when<00:00:18.090> capturing<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.539> home<00:00:18.690> base

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
kill because when capturing a home base

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779 
kill because when capturing a home base
thing<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.320> know<00:00:19.410> your<00:00:19.650> initial<00:00:20.010> flag<00:00:20.250> off<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
thing you know your initial flag off the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
thing you know your initial flag off the
start<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> domination<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.660> only<00:00:21.779> worth<00:00:21.960> 50

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
start of domination is only worth 50

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
start of domination is only worth 50
points<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.699> basically<00:00:23.880> equivalent<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
points so it's basically equivalent to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.849 
points so it's basically equivalent to
one<00:00:24.720> kill<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.439> four<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.769> those

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
one kill and I just got four of those

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.070 
one kill and I just got four of those
right<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.630> missing<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
right there so you know missing that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.859 
right there so you know missing that
capture<00:00:28.820> isn't<00:00:29.820> too<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.390> big<00:00:30.539> deal<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
capture isn't too much of a big deal you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
capture isn't too much of a big deal you
know<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.170> only<00:00:31.320> 50<00:00:31.710> points<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.340> think

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
know it's only 50 points and I think

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
know it's only 50 points and I think
you'll<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.820> by<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> does<00:00:33.630> help<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.930> little

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you'll get by but it does help a little

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.010 
you'll get by but it does help a little
bit<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.820> I'm<00:00:35.820> solo<00:00:36.090> capturing<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.870> here

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
bit and I'm solo capturing be right here

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.299 
bit and I'm solo capturing be right here
which<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.230> unfortunate<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.980> had<00:00:38.129> three

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
which is unfortunate because I had three

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.680 
which is unfortunate because I had three
or<00:00:38.399> four<00:00:38.550> teenage<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.360> me<00:00:39.540> you
