depending on what kind of features you

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.980 
depending on what kind of features you
want<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:30.310> can<00:00:30.460> get<00:00:30.609> them<00:00:30.699> with<00:00:31.029> or<00:00:31.359> without<00:00:31.510> a

want you can get them with or without a
high<00:00:32.430> performance<00:00:33.430> fish<00:00:33.879> finder<00:00:34.330> so<00:00:35.230> let's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
high performance fish finder so let's

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.170 
high performance fish finder so let's
just<00:00:35.860> go<00:00:35.980> through<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.370> range<00:00:36.579> really<00:00:36.760> quickly

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
just go through the range really quickly

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.639 
just go through the range really quickly
so<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.360> can<00:00:37.570> understand<00:00:37.989> why<00:00:38.140> they<00:00:38.290> have<00:00:38.410> so

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
so you can understand why they have so

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.819 
so you can understand why they have so
many<00:00:38.770> different<00:00:39.190> models<00:00:39.629> first<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.780> all<00:00:40.930> the

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
many different models first of all the

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.450 
many different models first of all the
521<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.700> 541<00:00:43.540> have<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.170> world<00:00:44.620> map<00:00:44.980> with<00:00:45.430> no

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
521 and 541 have a world map with no

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.610 
521 and 541 have a world map with no
specific<00:00:45.989> cartography<00:00:46.989> for<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.260> United

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
specific cartography for the United

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.310 
specific cartography for the United
States<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.670> if<00:00:49.059> you're<00:00:49.510> going<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.840> be<00:00:49.960> using<00:00:50.230> it

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
States so if you're going to be using it

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.779 
States so if you're going to be using it
outside<00:00:50.500> of<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.860> United<00:00:51.190> States<00:00:51.219> you<00:00:51.550> choose

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
outside of the United States you choose

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.310 
outside of the United States you choose
one<00:00:51.969> of<00:00:52.059> those<00:00:52.180> models<00:00:52.450> and<00:00:52.719> you<00:00:52.870> save<00:00:53.079> money

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
one of those models and you save money

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.869 
one of those models and you save money
because<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.829> doesn't<00:00:54.129> come<00:00:54.309> with<00:00:54.460> internal

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
because it doesn't come with internal

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.229 
because it doesn't come with internal
cartography<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:56.410> second<00:00:56.800> series<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.340> 531

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
cartography the second series is the 531

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.470 
cartography the second series is the 531
and<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:59.050> 536<00:00:59.980> they<00:01:00.520> come<00:01:00.789> with<00:01:00.969> inland

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
and the 536 they come with inland

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.479 
and the 536 they come with inland
cartography<00:01:02.289> so<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:02.620> get<00:01:02.800> really<00:01:03.250> accurate

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
cartography so you get really accurate

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.690 
cartography so you get really accurate
maps<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.300> inland<00:01:05.140> lakes<00:01:05.399> where<00:01:06.399> you<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.520> do

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
maps of inland lakes where you can do

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.870 
maps of inland lakes where you can do
recreational<00:01:07.330> fishing<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:07.900> navigation<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
recreational fishing and navigation the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.230 
recreational fishing and navigation the
final<00:01:10.270> series<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.960> 540<00:01:11.799> series<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.400> 541

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
final series is the 540 series the 541

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.070 
final series is the 540 series the 541
and<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:14.140> 546<00:01:15.040> these<00:01:15.760> have<00:01:16.060> blue<00:01:16.750> chart

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
and the 546 these have blue chart

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.260 
and the 546 these have blue chart
coastal<00:01:17.560> cartography<00:01:18.250> with<00:01:18.670> really

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
coastal cartography with really

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.050 
coastal cartography with really
wonderful<00:01:19.780> detail<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:21.040> those<00:01:21.340> are<00:01:21.610> for

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060

possibly power boater in addition you
can<00:01:28.030> get<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.509> different<00:01:28.840> screen<00:01:29.110> resolutions

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
can get to different screen resolutions

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.060 
can get to different screen resolutions
the<00:01:30.430> models<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:31.000> end<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.329> a1<00:01:31.780> are<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.140> quarter
