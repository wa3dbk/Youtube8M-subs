we're really excited to put it on the

we're really excited to put it on the
water<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.630> got<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.990> first<00:01:08.200> opportunity<00:01:08.830> to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860

paddle<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.400> sported<00:01:09.760> Outdoor<00:01:10.030> Retailer

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
paddle the sported Outdoor Retailer

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.170 
paddle the sported Outdoor Retailer
briefly<00:01:11.380> about<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> month<00:01:11.980> ago<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.520> I<00:01:13.030> was

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
briefly about a month ago and I was

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.180 
briefly about a month ago and I was
super<00:01:13.630> stoked<00:01:13.690> with<00:01:14.110> how<00:01:14.290> slippery<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.950> felt

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
super stoked with how slippery it felt

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.330 
super stoked with how slippery it felt
but<00:01:15.909> what<00:01:16.150> really<00:01:16.450> blew<00:01:16.870> my<00:01:17.050> mind<00:01:17.080> was<00:01:17.710> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
but what really blew my mind was the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.060 
but what really blew my mind was the
combination<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.240> glide<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.350> tracking<00:01:20.890> and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
combination of glide and tracking and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.390 
combination of glide and tracking and
speed<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:22.480> is<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.660> narrower<00:01:23.080> board<00:01:23.470> of<00:01:23.590> 26<00:01:24.100> so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
speed it is a narrower board of 26 so

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.030 
speed it is a narrower board of 26 so
probably<00:01:25.210> not<00:01:25.420> well-suited<00:01:26.020> for<00:01:26.440> a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
probably not well-suited for a

probably not well-suited for a
first-time<00:01:27.910> buyer<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.690> 14-foot<00:01:29.290> board
