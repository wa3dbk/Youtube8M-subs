see we'll see an upcoming video that I
have<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.159> with<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.460> at<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.700> range<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.320> guns

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
have it with it at the range so the guns

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.840 
have it with it at the range so the guns
I'm<00:01:14.680> looking<00:01:14.950> at<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.250> gun<00:01:15.399> might<00:01:15.579> end<00:01:15.729> up

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
I'm looking at the gun might end up

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.719 
I'm looking at the gun might end up
serving<00:01:16.119> double<00:01:16.750> duty<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:18.130> might<00:01:18.399> end<00:01:18.430> up

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
serving double duty it might end up

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.429 
serving double duty it might end up
being<00:01:18.969> in<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> safe<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.719> there<00:01:19.899> also<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.380> a

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
being in the safe in there also and a

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.920 
being in the safe in there also and a
light<00:01:20.649> hiking<00:01:21.159> camping<00:01:21.340> gun<00:01:21.789> also<00:01:22.090> instead<00:01:22.869> of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
light hiking camping gun also instead of

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.810 
light hiking camping gun also instead of
when<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.140> don't<00:01:23.350> need<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.770> 44<00:01:24.159> Magnum<00:01:24.189> that<00:01:24.729> I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
when I don't need the 44 Magnum that I

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.840 
when I don't need the 44 Magnum that I
have<00:01:25.000> for<00:01:25.210> camping<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.630> hiking<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.670> guns

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
have for camping and hiking so the guns

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.940 
have for camping and hiking so the guns
I'm<00:01:28.000> looking<00:01:28.329> at<00:01:28.509> would<00:01:28.869> be<00:01:29.020> on<00:01:29.439> one<00:01:29.920> side

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
I'm looking at would be on one side

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.940 
I'm looking at would be on one side
these<00:01:30.549> are<00:01:30.700> very<00:01:31.259> different<00:01:32.259> guns

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
these are very different guns

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.529 
these are very different guns
so<00:01:33.189> you'll<00:01:33.460> see<00:01:33.700> why<00:01:33.909> I'm<00:01:34.090> having<00:01:34.270> such<00:01:34.420> a

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
so you'll see why I'm having such a

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:35.639 
so you'll see why I'm having such a
trouble<00:01:34.780> deciding<00:01:35.020> traits<00:01:35.320> because<00:01:35.530> they're

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
trouble deciding traits because they're

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.550 
trouble deciding traits because they're
very<00:01:35.890> different<00:01:36.659> well<00:01:37.659> once<00:01:37.899> I'm<00:01:38.079> thinking<00:01:38.439> of

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
very different well once I'm thinking of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.539 
very different well once I'm thinking of

it's going to be in a wall safe all the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.359 
it's going to be in a wall safe all the
time<00:01:50.320> not<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.799> look<00:01:50.920> at<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.130> it's<00:01:51.250> ugly

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
time not going to look at it it's ugly

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.770 
time not going to look at it it's ugly
and<00:01:51.609> if<00:01:51.759> it's<00:01:51.909> something<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.299> think<00:01:52.359> hiking

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and if it's something you think hiking

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.910 
and if it's something you think hiking
who<00:01:52.899> cares<00:01:53.140> if<00:01:53.259> it's<00:01:53.380> pretty<00:01:53.560> when<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.829> go

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
who cares if it's pretty when you go

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.270 
who cares if it's pretty when you go
hiking<00:01:54.130> with<00:01:54.399> it<00:01:54.609> so<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.829> statics<00:01:57.159> are

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
hiking with it so when the statics are

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.620 
hiking with it so when the statics are
out<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.490> window<00:01:57.520> blocks<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.210> great<00:01:58.390> choice

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
out the window blocks a great choice

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.029 
out the window blocks a great choice
because<00:01:58.929> you<00:01:58.960> know<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.469> only<00:01:59.649> reason<00:01:59.829> both

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
because you know the only reason both

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.739 
because you know the only reason both
people<00:02:00.249> could<00:02:00.340> ever<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.579> got<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.969> object<00:02:01.630> to

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
people could ever have got the object to

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.929 
people could ever have got the object to
a<00:02:01.780> Glock<00:02:02.079> is<00:02:02.350> because<00:02:02.649> of<00:02:02.799> aesthetics<00:02:03.249> or<00:02:03.399> if

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
a Glock is because of aesthetics or if

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.010 
a Glock is because of aesthetics or if
they<00:02:04.060> now<00:02:04.179> are<00:02:04.420> comfortable<00:02:04.840> with<00:02:04.929> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
they now are comfortable with the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.569 
they now are comfortable with the
trigger<00:02:05.229> system<00:02:05.499> but<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:06.009> trigger<00:02:06.189> system<00:02:06.490> is

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
trigger system but the trigger system is

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.830 
trigger system but the trigger system is
something<00:02:06.729> I'm<00:02:06.909> comfortable<00:02:07.060> with<00:02:07.479> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
something I'm comfortable with so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.660 
something I'm comfortable with so
aesthetics<00:02:08.649> are<00:02:08.770> important<00:02:09.130> here<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.550> it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
aesthetics are important here so it

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.949 
aesthetics are important here so it
would<00:02:09.789> be<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> great<00:02:10.149> choice<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.420> both<00:02:10.780> of
