00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
so next we just need to assemble the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.950 
so next we just need to assemble the
shock<00:00:31.040> corded<00:00:31.460> alloy<00:00:31.850> pull<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.480> then<00:00:32.810> we'll

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
shock corded alloy pull and then we'll

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.510 
shock corded alloy pull and then we'll
show<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:33.170> how<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.590> attach<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
show you how to attach that to the

once<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.440> have<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:57.490> pull<00:00:57.910> ends<00:00:58.390> into<00:00:58.630> the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
once you have the pull ends into the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.320 
once you have the pull ends into the
eyelets<00:00:59.290> on<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.740> straps<00:01:00.040> at<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.280> bottom<00:01:00.610> all

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
eyelets on the straps at the bottom all

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.450 
eyelets on the straps at the bottom all
we<00:01:01.450> have<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.720> do<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.170> simply<00:01:02.410> start<00:01:03.100> attaching

we have to do is simply start attaching

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.140 
we have to do is simply start attaching
the<00:01:03.940> fly<00:01:04.120> sheet<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:05.230> the<00:01:05.380> pole<00:01:05.640> using<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
the fly sheet to the pole using the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:21.740 
the fly sheet to the pole using the
twist<00:01:07.480> clip<00:01:07.840> picks

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
once your fall is in place we just need

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.730 
once your fall is in place we just need
to<00:01:24.670> secure<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.510> end<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.500> ground

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
to secure the end of it to the ground

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:59.160

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
so now that you have pegged the 10th out

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.910 
so now that you have pegged the 10th out
of<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.330> corners<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.930> floor<00:02:03.200> we<00:02:03.890> just

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
of all the corners of the floor we just

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.560 
of all the corners of the floor we just
need<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.370> attach<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.790> guy<00:02:04.940> lens<00:02:05.210> using<00:02:05.510> the

storm<00:02:05.840> guard<00:02:06.080> system<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:07.250> peg<00:02:07.700> those<00:02:07.940> oh

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
storm guard system and then peg those oh

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.280 
storm guard system and then peg those oh
and<00:02:08.240> I'll<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.450> show<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.660> how<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.900> do<00:02:09.140> that

one<00:02:11.960> between<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.380> two<00:02:12.500> Galilean<00:02:12.980> points<00:02:13.480> if

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
one between the two Galilean points if

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.720 
one between the two Galilean points if
you<00:02:14.630> take<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.890> guy<00:02:16.040> laying<00:02:16.250> out<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
you take the guy laying out of the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.000 
you take the guy laying out of the
Guylaine<00:02:17.030> retainer<00:02:17.500> we'll<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.680> roll<00:02:18.830> that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
Guylaine retainer we'll just roll that

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.300 
Guylaine retainer we'll just roll that
out<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.510> here<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:21.230> if<00:02:21.380> we<00:02:21.500> tick<00:02:21.710> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
out what to do here is if we tick the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.180 
out what to do here is if we tick the
webbing<00:02:23.290> wrap<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.470> around<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.800> pole<00:02:25.390> wait<00:02:26.390> so

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
webbing wrap it around the pole wait so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.250 
webbing wrap it around the pole wait so
then<00:02:28.190> we're<00:02:29.150> good<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.390> bring<00:02:29.600> out<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> gayleen

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
then we're good to bring out the gayleen

00:02:30.260 --> 00:03:17.580 
then we're good to bring out the gayleen
from<00:02:30.590> there

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
