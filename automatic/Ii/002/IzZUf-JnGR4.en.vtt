00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.940
 hello to all that i love and we get 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.920
 found today for a new 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.230
 trick that will allow you to use 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.119
 and make applications work 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.500
 android on your mac 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.450
 and yes ladies and gentlemen this is 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.880
 free is not expensive and more 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.930
 true it's free so we'll do that 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.690
 with an implication called 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.040
 bluestacks so of course it's going to be that 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.570
 is not going to be exactly like you 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.830
 think we will not go on the google ogre 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.830
 play to go download 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.370
 applications and then launch them on 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.590
 his mac 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.820
 it's with an emulator but we go when 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.199
 even have to operate 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.070
 applications mac no no it's not a 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.979
 false title 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.870
 it really would have then the first 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.830
 to do is to install 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.260
 then two throws 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.229
 bluestacks and that gives us this 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.659
 window so then eventually you go 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.229
 in care of you download some 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.940
 applications 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.809
 so if you have different 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.030
 apps apps for for 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.830
 android so then you have the top 25 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.799
 fashion games photos social music 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.270
 messaging full of stuff and here you 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.210
 can go do a search for 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.090
 find other apps 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 so here you have maps ie 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.540
 my applications 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.660
 then you will go by default 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.660
 ap search facebook pulse and twitter who 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.850
 will be installed and I added 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.290
 fruit ninja free is the version 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.520
 free I did not pay a 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.440
 android app just for you 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 show that we know uses some on a 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.860
 mac 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 so for those who do not know it I 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.920
 tell you 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.200
 this application does not exist for mac 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.520
 so I deliberately found a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.230
 application that does not exist for mac 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.020
 for no one can find 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.850
 workers but good complexion so we go all 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.930
 immediately launched the application and that's 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.490
 party it's a more application or 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.760
 less known is a game so where you 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.659
 must cut fruits like a ninja 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.379
 with his salary not his lightsaber 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.030
 but his sword the so-called 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.610
 and so it's exactly like 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 the game on android so I'm going 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.489
 to make a new part awa it takes 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.140
 cut the lines there and I want to make a 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.840
 little harmless since I'm not very 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.840
 pure yeah that's seriously what what 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:38.410
 and it's not drawing I want to 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.260
 to make a kiff the sea and the six months 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.650
 to my moncet kit 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.850
 here is but I saw what a handsome kid 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.920
 oh yeah actually there's no bongo if 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.890
 that's why it was, I guess 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.890
 finally then you will notice that I 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.930
 cut that every time exact flight there 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.780
 exactly in the middle then there we 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:06.660
 is going to break by against is at I 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.340
 wanted to make me a little hop hop kiff 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.230
 that was for those who know 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.340
 so here and here we can leave 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.960
 finally I will not teach you to 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.960
 use the fruit ninja app 1 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.970
 here and I will leave simply 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.710
 application 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.070
 so yes I'm sure I want 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.860
 leave this application so put that's it 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.120
 so what I was afraid the fan 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.440
 to get fully in and I see 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.380
 that begins to rise so there I go 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.730
 not too much I was going to run a 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.980
 other application to see but I'm going 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.300
 not do it eventually to prevent that 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.630
 you did not hear anything at the end of 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.710
 the video 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.920
 so that's just this 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.160
 game emulator to take to ide 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.270
 that you can play on mac 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.830
 so here I present you anyway 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.510
 a little bit how it goes for 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:06.630

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:52.520
 bern note good game there when i the 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:55.420
 do not run halal crazy smiling here and 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.440
 I'm not going to log in so this is 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.710
 it will stay there but as you 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.470
 can see it works fine 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.880
 hop if I want to create an account 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.180
 here and there I have my case so I'm going 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.060
 try 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.710
 is we know yes the keyboard of the mac 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.490
 also works so that's it 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.230
 perfect it's just perfect 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.610
 we can go back to the menu here then there 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.180
 I guess we have preferences 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.130
 yes so here it's really like on a 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.340
 on an android trick for example change 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:30.670
 the language we are going to choose from 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:34.160
 French not too easy we will choose 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.980
 Romanian I feel that a Romanian 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.190
 186 from Greek 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:44.120
 Greek oleg we will understand nothing here 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:47.570
 and there you say to your urge to cry 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.740
 what end is 1.21 me the sounds that 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.740
 stay at good I was going to say that remains 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.690
 understandable but actually no good ah 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.700
 in fact it does not change enormously invested 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.460
 that's it and there's just the trick installed 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.840
 who changed what is 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.600
 Well, that's all for this little girl 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.360
 little trick so one that lets you I 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.110
 remind him to use apps 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.480
 android on your mac bluestacks is 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.920
 still in beta I'm sorry I 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.920
 am trying to shoot me I'm tired 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.990
 bluestacks is still in beta 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.890
 so I waited patiently for this 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.150
 I know this application 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.490
 for a little while it has to 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.400
 do what three four months that she 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.370
 is in beta but so I say ok 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.540
 we may be waiting for the 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.520
 the official go out like that I do my 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.430
 little presentation and we have more bugs 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.690
 except that no, I do not know if it's still 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.670
 developing or not but in any case 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.990
 she's ironing I think that 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.620
 can wait a lot of time 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.000
 to have a definitive version but 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.900
 anyway I feel like the 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.460
 beta and more iboguhé that's finally okay 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.960
 that's how you have 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.250
 the trick use apps 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.990
 android on his act and so that allows 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.260
 to use applications that does not exist 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.480
 not yet on mac on mac as per 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.070
 example this one so that's all 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.870
 for this little trick like 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.360
 usually I ask you everything 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.320
 just a little green thumb 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.540
 now a big but anyway the 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.940
 people all the same size and then a bath 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.630
 again for those interested in 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.780
 these wonderful seller who left then 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.380
 to say it's an orchid 6.6 is 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.510
 not an orchid 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:35.170
 yes you can lynch me in 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.460
