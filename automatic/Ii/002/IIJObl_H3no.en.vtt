left the KTM struggling to find its top
spot<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.870> never<00:00:44.990> really<00:00:45.320> did<00:00:45.470> find<00:00:45.770> the

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
spot and it never really did find the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.440 
spot and it never really did find the
top<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:46.310> bought<00:00:46.490> it<00:00:46.610> never<00:00:46.760> took<00:00:46.970> first<00:00:47.270> place

top we bought it never took first place

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.770 
top we bought it never took first place
kind<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.800> any<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.520> categories<00:00:49.780> KTM

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
kind of in any of the categories KTM

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.290 
kind of in any of the categories KTM
seems<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.079> be<00:00:51.200> up<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:51.500> top<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.890> stuff<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:53.150> know

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
seems to be up on top of stuff you know

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.180 
seems to be up on top of stuff you know
just<00:00:53.329> wagging<00:00:54.260> its<00:00:54.320> tail<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.950> it's

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
just wagging its tail and it's

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.060 
just wagging its tail and it's
definitely<00:00:55.970> more<00:00:56.390> skittish<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:57.470> think<00:00:57.800> if<00:00:57.920> we

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
definitely more skittish I think if we

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.410 
definitely more skittish I think if we
were<00:00:58.160> riding<00:00:58.340> somewhere<00:00:58.760> where<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.090> was<00:00:59.180> more

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
were riding somewhere where it was more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.460 
were riding somewhere where it was more
wide<00:00:59.630> open<00:01:00.070> desert<00:01:01.070> II<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:02.090> know<00:01:02.260> stuff<00:01:03.260> for

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
wide open desert II you know stuff for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.649 
wide open desert II you know stuff for
trails<00:01:03.770> that<00:01:03.980> were<00:01:04.100> bigger<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:04.640> knew<00:01:05.119> KTM<00:01:05.540> would

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
trails that were bigger I knew KTM would

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.690 
trails that were bigger I knew KTM would
have<00:01:05.750> fared<00:01:05.930> better<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.860> wants<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.189> spin<00:01:07.460> up<00:01:07.610> a

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
have fared better it wants to spin up a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.920 
have fared better it wants to spin up a
little<00:01:07.880> bit<00:01:08.030> more<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.570> gets<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.810> little

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
little bit more and it gets a little

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.130 
little bit more and it gets a little
buck<00:01:09.290> wild<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.130> little<00:01:10.460> bit<00:01:10.610> but<00:01:10.939> I<00:01:11.810> mean

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
buck wild on you a little bit but I mean

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.630 
buck wild on you a little bit but I mean
it's<00:01:12.290> not<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.649> big<00:01:12.829> of<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:13.070> difference<00:01:13.219> but

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's not that big of a difference but

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.459 
it's not that big of a difference but
it's<00:01:13.790> enough<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.119> notice<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.840> enough<00:01:15.079> to<00:01:15.259> make

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
it's enough to notice and enough to make

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.950 
it's enough to notice and enough to make
make<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.610> know<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.760> difference<00:01:17.210> when<00:01:17.420> you're

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
make you know a difference when you're

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.680 
make you know a difference when you're
actually<00:01:18.170> out<00:01:18.350> on<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.620> trail<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:26.090> bike<00:01:26.360> will

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
actually out on the trail that bike will

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.899 
actually out on the trail that bike will
turn<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.560> little<00:01:27.830> bit<00:01:28.040> quicker<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.700> tight

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
turn a little bit quicker and the tight

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.520 
turn a little bit quicker and the tight
stuff<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.510> we<00:01:29.600> were<00:01:29.690> out<00:01:29.810> at<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.080> singletrack

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
stuff and we were out at a singletrack

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.430 
stuff and we were out at a singletrack
spot<00:01:31.010> and<00:01:31.540> that<00:01:32.540> bike<00:01:32.810> really<00:01:33.140> shined

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
spot and that bike really shined

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.320 
spot and that bike really shined
especially<00:01:34.010> on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.220> brakes<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:38.090> kind<00:01:38.299> of

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
especially on the brakes it's kind of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.990 
especially on the brakes it's kind of
nice<00:01:38.510> just<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:39.020> little<00:01:39.440> tiny<00:01:39.619> bit<00:01:39.770> but<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.610> mean

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
nice just a little tiny bit but I mean

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.090 
nice just a little tiny bit but I mean
if<00:01:41.240> if<00:01:41.540> you're<00:01:41.840> if<00:01:42.049> you're<00:01:42.200> riding<00:01:42.710> at<00:01:42.799> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
if if you're if you're riding at a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.710 
if if you're if you're riding at a
decent<00:01:43.460> pace<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.090> you're<00:01:44.210> not<00:01:44.360> just<00:01:44.479> putting

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
decent pace and you're not just putting

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.830 
decent pace and you're not just putting
along<00:01:44.990> around<00:01:45.619> like<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.920> squid<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.930> bike<00:01:48.110> works

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
along around like a squid the bike works

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.039 
along around like a squid the bike works
in<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.469> 250cc<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.490> dura<00:01:51.609> class<00:01:52.049> competition

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
in the 250cc and dura class competition

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.389 
in the 250cc and dura class competition
is<00:01:53.170> fierce<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.649> even<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.070> smallest

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
is fierce and even the smallest

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.919 
is fierce and even the smallest
imperfections<00:01:55.179> give<00:01:55.299> me<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.600> difference

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
imperfections give me the difference

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.740 
imperfections give me the difference
between<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.439> win<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.399> loss<00:01:57.479> after<00:01:58.479> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
between a win and a loss after the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.510 
between a win and a loss after the
scores<00:01:59.020> were<00:01:59.170> tallied<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.909> 2013<00:02:00.909> KTM<00:02:01.509> xcw<00:02:02.520> is
