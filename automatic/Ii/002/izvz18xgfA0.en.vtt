in<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:12.929> video<00:00:13.230> we're<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.740> cleaning

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
in this video we're going to be cleaning

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.540 
in this video we're going to be cleaning
out<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> carbon<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.730> your<00:00:14.759> engine<00:00:15.590> using<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
out the carbon in your engine using the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.510 
out the carbon in your engine using the
water<00:00:18.320> decarbonisation<00:00:19.320> method<00:00:19.619> we're<00:00:20.490> going

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
water decarbonisation method we're going

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.480 
water decarbonisation method we're going
to<00:00:20.730> need<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:22.880> some<00:00:23.880> water

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
to need is one of these and some water

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.830 
to need is one of these and some water
now<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.760> necessarily<00:00:26.849> need<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.810> of

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
now you don't necessarily need one of

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.130 
now you don't necessarily need one of
those<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.769> chose<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> those<00:00:29.670> because

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
those but I chose one of those because

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.380 
those but I chose one of those because
it<00:00:31.140> keeps<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> consistent<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.430> clean<00:00:32.899> so

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
it keeps it consistent and it's clean so

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.110 
it keeps it consistent and it's clean so
let's<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.510> it

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.400 

when<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.270> doing<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:42.809> sure<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.170> car

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
when you're doing this make sure the car

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.160 
when you're doing this make sure the car
is<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> temperature<00:00:44.690> as<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> see

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is up to temperature as you can see

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.310 
is up to temperature as you can see
there<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.190> hold<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:48.140> two<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
there and to hold it on about two and a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.360 
there and to hold it on about two and a
half<00:00:49.500> hours<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> ribs

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.870 

if<00:00:52.880> you<00:00:53.000> don't<00:00:53.210> have<00:00:53.360> anyone<00:00:53.780> with<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:54.880> use

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
if you don't have anyone with you use

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.140 
if you don't have anyone with you use
the<00:00:56.030> car<00:00:56.330> Matt<00:00:57.280> need<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.370> call<00:00:58.610> Matt<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.650> just

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
the car Matt need to call Matt and just

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.990 
the car Matt need to call Matt and just
wedge<00:01:02.150> it<00:01:02.180> between<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:03.110> accelerator<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.489> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
wedge it between the accelerator and the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.370 
wedge it between the accelerator and the
brake<00:01:05.210> right<00:01:05.449> this

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.270 

okay<00:01:09.380> we're<00:01:09.560> going<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> start<00:01:09.950> by<00:01:10.100> removing

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
okay we're going to start by removing

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.820 
okay we're going to start by removing
the<00:01:10.760> intake<00:01:11.150> hose<00:01:11.210> now<00:01:11.870> this<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.350> hose

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
the intake hose now this is the hose

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.700 
the intake hose now this is the hose
that<00:01:13.070> goes<00:01:13.130> into<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.000> manifold<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.870> can<00:01:15.530> see

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
that goes into the manifold you can see

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.219 
that goes into the manifold you can see
I'm<00:01:15.800> just<00:01:15.950> backing<00:01:16.190> off<00:01:16.430> there<00:01:17.020> why<00:01:18.020> don't<00:01:18.080> you

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
I'm just backing off there why don't you

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.290 
I'm just backing off there why don't you
put<00:01:18.410> it<00:01:18.440> off<00:01:18.680> try<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.280> ease<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.760> off<00:01:19.910> with<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
put it off try and ease it off with the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300 
put it off try and ease it off with the
screwdriver<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.380> lift<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:21.800> up<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.190> got

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
screwdriver and lift it up so you got

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.340 
screwdriver and lift it up so you got
access<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.760> it<00:01:22.990> when<00:01:23.990> you're<00:01:24.140> ready<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.710> go

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
access to it when you're ready to go

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.550 
access to it when you're ready to go
with<00:01:27.350> your<00:01:27.530> war<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:28.190> your<00:01:28.430> bottle<00:01:29.320> just<00:01:30.320> start

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
with your war in your bottle just start

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.060 
with your war in your bottle just start
to<00:01:30.740> get<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.250> little<00:01:32.500> consistent<00:01:33.500> flow<00:01:33.770> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
to get a little consistent flow and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.890 
to get a little consistent flow and
start<00:01:34.400> putting<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.670> into<00:01:34.759> there<00:01:35.000> into<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
start putting it into there into the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.290 
start putting it into there into the
inlet<00:01:36.380> manifold<00:01:36.710> into<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.700> inlet<00:01:37.970> hose<00:01:38.119> I

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
inlet manifold into the inlet hose I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.480 
inlet manifold into the inlet hose I
should<00:01:38.450> say<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.560> because<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.009> hose<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.460> a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
should say and because the hose is a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.520 
should say and because the hose is a
slightly<00:01:40.940> awkward<00:01:41.090> position<00:01:41.750> what<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.080> did<00:01:42.350> was

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
slightly awkward position what I did was

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.560 
slightly awkward position what I did was
I<00:01:42.649> removed<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.399> straw<00:01:43.759> from<00:01:44.000> inside<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
I removed the straw from inside the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.960 
I removed the straw from inside the
bottle<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.590> could<00:01:45.890> hold<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.310> an<00:01:46.460> upside

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
bottle so I could hold it in an upside

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.719 
bottle so I could hold it in an upside
down<00:01:47.710> angle<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.070> will<00:01:49.220> give<00:01:49.399> me<00:01:49.490> better

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
down angle this will give me better

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.639 
down angle this will give me better
access<00:01:50.149> into<00:01:50.330> actually<00:01:50.600> shooting<00:01:50.869> war<00:01:51.170> into

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
access into actually shooting war into

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.260 
access into actually shooting war into
this<00:01:51.770> base<00:01:52.009> itself<00:01:52.369> into<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> actual<00:01:53.090> hose

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
this base itself into the actual hose

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:03.520 
this base itself into the actual hose
itself<00:01:53.600> as<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:53.899> see<00:01:54.200> there

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.380 

it's<00:02:04.530> important<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.980> expect<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> revs

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it's important to expect that the revs

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
it's important to expect that the revs
to<00:02:06.660> fluctuate<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.460> where<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to fluctuate this is this is where the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
to fluctuate this is this is where the
arm<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.540> waters<00:02:09.869> actually<00:02:10.050> making<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.619> into

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
arm the waters actually making it into

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
arm the waters actually making it into
the<00:02:10.830> cylinder<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.460> doing<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> work<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.240> we

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the cylinder and doing the work that we

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.510 
the cylinder and doing the work that we
wanted<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.960> do<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> cleaner

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
wanted to do if we know a cleaner

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.430 
wanted to do if we know a cleaner
cylinder<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> cleaner<00:02:15.450> engine<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.050> or<00:02:16.200> work

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
cylinder is a cleaner engine and or work

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.520 
cylinder is a cleaner engine and or work
better<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.810> don't<00:02:19.050> don't<00:02:19.350> be

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
better like that so don't don't don't be

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.500 
better like that so don't don't don't be
too<00:02:19.710> worried<00:02:20.040> about<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.430> try<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.000> kill<00:02:21.330> the

too worried about it try not to kill the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.030 
too worried about it try not to kill the
engine<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> water<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.650> long<00:02:22.800> as<00:02:22.830> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
engine with the water and as long as you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.980 
engine with the water and as long as you
put<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.610> sort<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.940> proportion<00:02:24.570> the

put it in this sort of proportion the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.110 
put it in this sort of proportion the
engine<00:02:25.380> will<00:02:25.470> be<00:02:25.590> fine<00:02:25.890> if<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.550> start<00:02:26.970> putting

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
engine will be fine if you start putting

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
engine will be fine if you start putting
cups<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.810> water<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:28.470> that's<00:02:28.770> when<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
cups of water in there that's when you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.220 
cups of water in there that's when you
could<00:02:29.460> potentially<00:02:30.330> encourage<00:02:30.960> what<00:02:31.140> they

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
could potentially encourage what they

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.280 
could potentially encourage what they
call<00:02:31.500> hydro<00:02:31.950> locking<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.870> not<00:02:34.050> you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
call hydro locking and it's not you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.420 
call hydro locking and it's not you
don't<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.620> Hydra<00:02:34.950> locked<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.190> anything

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
don't to be Hydra locked in anything

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.650 
don't to be Hydra locked in anything
you'd<00:02:35.730> only<00:02:35.910> put<00:02:36.150> yourself<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.600> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you'd only put yourself in that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
you'd only put yourself in that
situation<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.560> quite<00:02:37.830> extreme<00:02:38.160> but

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
situation but that is quite extreme but

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
situation but that is quite extreme but
if<00:02:39.000> you're<00:02:39.150> using<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.570> method<00:02:40.020> similar<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.530> what

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
if you're using a method similar to what

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.890 
if you're using a method similar to what
I'm<00:02:40.770> doing<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:41.310> your<00:02:41.850> engine<00:02:42.180> will<00:02:42.270> be<00:02:42.300> fine

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
I'm doing here your engine will be fine

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.020 
I'm doing here your engine will be fine
it<00:02:42.990> would<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.200> safe<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.190> everything<00:02:44.850> will

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
it would be safe and and everything will

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.120 
it would be safe and and everything will
go<00:02:45.240> according<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.380> plan

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.920 

in<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.370> video<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.390> used<00:02:54.630> about<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
in this video I think I used about a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.710 
in this video I think I used about a
pint<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.500> water<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.970> seems<00:02:57.270> enough<00:02:57.510> for

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
pint of water and that seems enough for

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.390 
pint of water and that seems enough for
me<00:02:57.840> when<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.080> seems<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.440> be<00:02:58.530> managing<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.980> okay

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
me when it seems to be managing it okay

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.010 
me when it seems to be managing it okay
and<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.640> sounded<00:03:00.210> bare<00:03:00.420> you'll<00:03:00.660> hear<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
and it sounded bare you'll hear the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.050 
and it sounded bare you'll hear the
engine<00:03:01.620> start<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.920> sound<00:03:02.160> different<00:03:02.340> that's

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
engine start to sound different that's

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.180 
engine start to sound different that's
when<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.240> decided<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.720> stop<00:03:04.080> now<00:03:04.770> depending<00:03:05.160> on

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
when I decided to stop now depending on

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
when I decided to stop now depending on
how<00:03:05.400> old<00:03:05.670> your<00:03:05.970> car<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.330> or<00:03:06.420> how<00:03:06.540> many<00:03:06.600> mileage

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
how old your car is or how many mileage

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.290 
how old your car is or how many mileage
it's<00:03:07.320> got<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.790> could<00:03:08.940> do<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.150> as

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
it's got it you could do this as

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300 
it's got it you could do this as
regularly<00:03:09.720> as<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.350> want<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.740> mean<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.190> got

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
regularly as you want I mean if it's got

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.740 
regularly as you want I mean if it's got
particularly<00:03:11.730> high<00:03:11.880> mileage<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
particularly high mileage in you and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.840 
particularly high mileage in you and
it's<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.170> running<00:03:13.440> lumpy<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.160> would<00:03:14.730> say

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
it's and it's running lumpy I would say

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.520 
it's and it's running lumpy I would say
once<00:03:15.150> every<00:03:15.420> three<00:03:15.600> months<00:03:15.780> once<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.320> month

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
once every three months once a month

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.620 
once every three months once a month
between<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.130> sort<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.430> ratio<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.390> if<00:03:18.480> your

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
between that sort of ratio but if your

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.140 
between that sort of ratio but if your
car's<00:03:18.870> been<00:03:19.080> pretty<00:03:19.709> well<00:03:19.860> maintained<00:03:20.400> then

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
car's been pretty well maintained then

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.030 
car's been pretty well maintained then
just<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.720> do<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:21.959> once<00:03:22.170> every<00:03:22.290> six<00:03:22.650> month<00:03:22.890> for

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
just just do it once every six month for

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.250 
just just do it once every six month for
every<00:03:23.340> service<00:03:23.820> it's<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.450> easy<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.020> do<00:03:25.170> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
every service it's so easy you can do it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.210 
every service it's so easy you can do it
when<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.530> want<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.700> that's<00:03:26.820> my<00:03:27.090> advice

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.380 

once<00:03:32.220> you're<00:03:32.370> finished<00:03:32.400> doing<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> water

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
once you're finished doing the water

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.960 
once you're finished doing the water
cleaning<00:03:34.050> or<00:03:34.500> cleansing<00:03:34.970> decarbonisation

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
cleaning or cleansing decarbonisation

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.670 
cleaning or cleansing decarbonisation
where<00:03:36.090> everyone<00:03:36.330> will<00:03:36.450> call<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.750> fit<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.470> car

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
where everyone will call it fit the car

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.250 
where everyone will call it fit the car
back<00:03:37.890> up<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.280> take<00:03:38.550> it<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> test<00:03:39.090> drive

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.020 

okay<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.560> back<00:03:43.680> after<00:03:44.070> decarbonizing<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
okay just back after decarbonizing the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.630 
okay just back after decarbonizing the
car<00:03:45.239> with<00:03:45.450> water<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.260> water<00:03:46.290> method<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.130> have

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
car with water the water method I have

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.570 
car with water the water method I have
to<00:03:47.790> say<00:03:47.970> an<00:03:48.320> immediate<00:03:49.320> effect<00:03:49.580> they

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
to say an immediate effect they

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.220 
to say an immediate effect they
immediately<00:03:50.910> know<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.330> less<00:03:51.540> smoke<00:03:51.810> less

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
immediately know it's less smoke less

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.000 
immediately know it's less smoke less
smoke<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.620> change<00:03:52.920> down<00:03:53.220> arm<00:03:54.350> more<00:03:55.350> responsive

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
smoke on change down arm more responsive

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.100 
smoke on change down arm more responsive
through<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.250> gears<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.730> even<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.540> turbo<00:03:57.930> was

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
through the gears I even the turbo was

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
through the gears I even the turbo was
more<00:03:58.410> arm<00:03:58.799> whistle<00:03:59.580> II<00:03:59.670> a<00:04:00.680> lot<00:04:01.680> more<00:04:01.950> that

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
more arm whistle II a lot more that

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.770 
more arm whistle II a lot more that
going<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.150> was<00:04:03.180> generally<00:04:03.420> more

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
going on and it was generally more

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.770 
going on and it was generally more
responsive<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.920> very<00:04:05.190> safe<00:04:05.549> method<00:04:05.970> um

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
responsive it's a very safe method um

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.620 
responsive it's a very safe method um
and<00:04:07.530> yeah<00:04:08.190> definitely<00:04:08.790> try<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.510> would

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
and yeah definitely try it I would

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.960 
and yeah definitely try it I would
advise<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.170> as<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.830> know<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> theory<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
advise it as you know the theory is the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.000 
advise it as you know the theory is the
the<00:04:12.209> wall<00:04:12.390> goes<00:04:12.630> into<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> cylinders<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.650> it

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
the wall goes into the cylinders and it

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.890 
the wall goes into the cylinders and it
actually<00:04:14.130> melts<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.880> carbon<00:04:15.299> what's<00:04:15.480> inside

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
actually melts the carbon what's inside

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.420 
actually melts the carbon what's inside
the<00:04:16.080> actual<00:04:16.290> cylinders<00:04:16.769> itself<00:04:17.190> and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the actual cylinders itself and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.180 
the actual cylinders itself and
everything<00:04:18.090> around<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.750> now<00:04:19.320> apparently<00:04:19.890> it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
everything around it now apparently it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.990 
everything around it now apparently it
water<00:04:20.940> expands<00:04:22.520> 1500<00:04:23.520> times<00:04:23.700> on<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
water expands 1500 times on the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.850 
water expands 1500 times on the
combustion<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.690> don't<00:04:25.140> know<00:04:25.229> exactly<00:04:25.650> how

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
combustion that I don't know exactly how

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.590 
combustion that I don't know exactly how
true<00:04:26.130> or<00:04:26.250> not<00:04:26.460> true<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.970> by<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.210> small

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
true or not true that is by a small

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.310 
true or not true that is by a small
circuit<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.590> um<00:04:29.180> yeah<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.720> advise

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
circuit and um yeah so I advise

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.740 
circuit and um yeah so I advise
definitely<00:04:31.710> try<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.360> be<00:04:33.360> good<00:04:33.510> for<00:04:33.690> your

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
definitely try it be good for your

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
definitely try it be good for your
client<00:04:34.080> won't<00:04:34.200> do<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.500> no<00:04:34.620> harm<00:04:36.169> yeah<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.500> oh

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
client won't do it no harm yeah and oh

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.200 
client won't do it no harm yeah and oh
this<00:04:37.950> would<00:04:38.070> be<00:04:38.100> fine<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.370> old<00:04:38.669> cars<00:04:38.940> as<00:04:39.090> well

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
this would be fine on old cars as well

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.550 
this would be fine on old cars as well
somebody<00:04:39.630> old<00:04:39.810> clean<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.290> some<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.500> the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
somebody old clean that some of the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.930 
somebody old clean that some of the
other<00:04:40.680> injector<00:04:41.160> cleaners<00:04:41.490> would<00:04:41.610> actually

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
other injector cleaners would actually

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.390 
other injector cleaners would actually
melt<00:04:42.419> some<00:04:42.630> of<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.750> rubbers<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.770> are<00:04:43.890> inside

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
melt some of the rubbers that are inside

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.719 
melt some of the rubbers that are inside
the<00:04:44.640> car<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:46.530> me<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:46.979> a<00:04:47.010> much<00:04:47.400> more

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
the car for me this is a much more

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.320 
the car for me this is a much more
natural<00:04:48.620> method<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.800> cleaning<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.910> inside<00:04:51.030> of

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
natural method of cleaning the inside of

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.390 
natural method of cleaning the inside of
your<00:04:51.419> car<00:04:51.690> rather<00:04:51.990> than<00:04:52.140> using<00:04:52.320> them<00:04:52.560> dodgy

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
your car rather than using them dodgy

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.800 
your car rather than using them dodgy
oil<00:04:53.610> products<00:04:54.030> because<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:54.479> gotta<00:04:54.660> remember

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
oil products because you gotta remember

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.560 
oil products because you gotta remember
fundamentally<00:04:55.650> oil<00:04:56.220> is<00:04:56.610> what<00:04:56.940> creates<00:04:57.360> the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
fundamentally oil is what creates the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.170 
fundamentally oil is what creates the
carbon<00:04:57.960> inside<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.890> engine<00:04:59.010> so<00:04:59.550> you<00:05:00.030> know

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
carbon inside the engine so you know

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.450 
carbon inside the engine so you know
you're<00:05:00.539> using<00:05:01.260> dirty<00:05:01.830> water<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.160> mop<00:05:02.280> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
you're using dirty water to mop the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.230 
you're using dirty water to mop the
floor<00:05:02.700> if<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.150> makes<00:05:03.390> sense

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
floor if that makes sense

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.820 
floor if that makes sense
so<00:05:04.419> for<00:05:04.780> me<00:05:04.930> this<00:05:05.080> is<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.259> far<00:05:05.470> more<00:05:05.500> natural

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
so for me this is a far more natural

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.680 
so for me this is a far more natural
method<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.990> um<00:05:07.990> yep<00:05:08.919> try<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.569> grabbed<00:05:10.569> it

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
method and um yep try it grabbed it

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.870 
method and um yep try it grabbed it
helped<00:05:10.960> well<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.620> hope<00:05:11.889> it<00:05:12.039> helped

helped well I hope it helped

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.770 
helped well I hope it helped

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
it helps me color rate subscribe and

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.719 
it helps me color rate subscribe and
