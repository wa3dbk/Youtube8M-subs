00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
let's get a closer look at this guy so

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.080 
let's get a closer look at this guy so
straight<00:02:20.410> off<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.770> bat<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.550> can<00:02:21.580> see<00:02:21.940> that

detailed head sculpt for a figure of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.460 
detailed head sculpt for a figure of
this<00:02:38.830> size<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.050> individual

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
detailed figure for the size that it is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.910 
detailed figure for the size that it is
and<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.250> quite<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> small<00:02:48.850> one<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:50.740> are

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
and it's quite a small one but are

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
definition of the jawline really nice

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.100 
definition of the jawline really nice
then<00:03:00.490> as<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.730> move<00:03:00.940> up<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> body<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:01.870> see

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
then as we move up the body you can see

we've got loads of lumps and bumps and
tiny<00:03:04.330> scales<00:03:05.790> going<00:03:06.790> down<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.330> arms<00:03:08.730> you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
tiny scales going down to the arms you

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.910 
tiny scales going down to the arms you
can<00:03:09.910> make<00:03:10.120> out<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.200> outline<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
can make out the the outline of the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.280 
can make out the the outline of the
musculature<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:14.250> hand<00:03:15.250> claws<00:03:16.290> really

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.500 
musculature and the hand claws really
nice<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.640> as<00:03:18.760> we<00:03:18.850> go<00:03:18.970> along<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.330> back

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
way along the neck and onto the back

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.160 
way along the neck and onto the back
they're<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.010> like<00:03:24.450> crocodilian<00:03:25.450> ridges<00:03:25.930> all

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
they're just like crocodilian ridges all

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.520 
they're just like crocodilian ridges all
the<00:03:26.320> way<00:03:26.440> along<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.870> then<00:03:28.870> here<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.200> can<00:03:29.380> see

back really nice then here you can see
on<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.239> ribcage<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.780> can<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.110> skin

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
on the ribcage you can see the skin

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.790 
on the ribcage you can see the skin
pulling<00:03:39.489> taut<00:03:40.000> from<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> arms<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.350> also<00:03:41.620> from

crocodilian<00:03:48.370> sort<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:48.850> scaling<00:03:49.150> underneath

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
crocodilian sort of scaling underneath

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.020 
crocodilian sort of scaling underneath
and<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.650> nice<00:03:50.830> contrast<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.640> paint<00:03:51.880> scheme

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
sort of a half rubbery plastic you can

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.210 
sort of a half rubbery plastic you can
see<00:06:07.120> here<00:06:07.390> if<00:06:07.510> I<00:06:07.630> move<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:08.080> wrist<00:06:08.320> it<00:06:09.070> is

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
see here if I move the wrist it is

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.800 
see here if I move the wrist it is
actually<00:06:09.550> quite<00:06:09.669> flexible<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:10.360> it<00:06:10.479> gives<00:06:10.660> us

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
actually quite flexible and it gives us

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.200 
actually quite flexible and it gives us
this<00:06:10.930> sort<00:06:11.169> of<00:06:11.290> semi<00:06:11.590> realistic<00:06:12.280> feeling<00:06:12.760> skin

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
this sort of semi realistic feeling skin

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.360 
this sort of semi realistic feeling skin
I<00:06:13.240> always<00:06:13.630> like<00:06:13.870> that<00:06:14.169> I<00:06:14.350> always<00:06:14.740> appreciate

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
it when manufacturers put a little bit

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.710 
it when manufacturers put a little bit
of<00:06:16.960> rubber<00:06:17.290> into<00:06:17.560> these<00:06:18.240> figurines<00:06:19.240> because

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
of rubber into these figurines because

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.510 
of rubber into these figurines because
they<00:06:19.840> do<00:06:19.900> feel<00:06:20.320> more<00:06:20.530> genuine<00:06:21.010> due<00:06:21.220> to<00:06:21.370> that

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
they do feel more genuine due to that

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.000 
they do feel more genuine due to that
and<00:06:22.330> this<00:06:22.450> rubberiness<00:06:22.900> also<00:06:23.350> gives<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.740> fish

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
and this rubberiness also gives the fish

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.790 
and this rubberiness also gives the fish
a<00:06:24.280> little<00:06:24.550> flexibility<00:06:25.479> which<00:06:25.750> is<00:06:25.780> cool<00:06:26.169> so<00:06:26.620> in

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
a little flexibility which is cool so in

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.670 
a little flexibility which is cool so in
terms<00:06:27.040> of<00:06:27.220> the<00:06:27.310> scale<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.870> egg<00:06:28.990> the<00:06:29.169> venatori

this<00:06:46.450> is<00:06:46.630> a<00:06:46.660> smaller<00:06:47.050> figure<00:06:47.500> it<00:06:47.710> is<00:06:48.250> actually

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
this is a smaller figure it is actually

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.320 
this is a smaller figure it is actually
packed<00:06:48.970> with

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
packed with

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.029

is in terms of his scale we've also got
here<00:07:12.940> another<00:07:13.180> collect<00:07:13.629> a<00:07:13.780> product<00:07:14.199> that

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
here another collect a product that

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.809 
here another collect a product that
we've<00:07:14.379> recently<00:07:14.800> reviewed<00:07:15.129> on<00:07:15.370> the<00:07:15.490> channel

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:15.819 
we've recently reviewed on the channel

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.110 
we've recently reviewed on the channel
it's<00:07:16.360> the<00:07:16.569> one<00:07:16.780> 15<00:07:17.349> scale<00:07:17.770> Tyrannosaurus<00:07:18.759> Rex

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
and he is humongous so there that gives

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.279 
and he is humongous so there that gives
you<00:07:23.979> some<00:07:24.219> idea<00:07:24.580> not<00:07:25.389> only<00:07:25.659> the<00:07:25.780> sort<00:07:25.960> of<00:07:25.990> scale

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289 
you some idea not only the sort of scale

you some idea not only the sort of scale
of<00:07:26.530> the<00:07:26.620> inky<00:07:26.889> venator<00:07:27.340> is<00:07:27.520> also<00:07:27.879> how<00:07:28.030> big<00:07:28.419> this

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
of the inky venator is also how big this

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.959
