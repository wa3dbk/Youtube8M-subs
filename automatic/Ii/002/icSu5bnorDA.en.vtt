00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.940 

I<00:00:12.090> think<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.179> challenge<00:00:13.570> is<00:00:13.690> a<00:00:13.719> great<00:00:14.019> new

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
I think the challenge is a great new

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.670 
I think the challenge is a great new
event<00:00:15.430> that's<00:00:15.670> sort<00:00:16.299> of<00:00:16.410> starting<00:00:17.410> to<00:00:17.439> come

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
event that's sort of starting to come

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.070 
event that's sort of starting to come
out<00:00:17.710> in<00:00:18.070> in<00:00:18.550> oil<00:00:18.820> all<00:00:19.090> on<00:00:19.360> performance<00:00:19.930> for

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
out in in oil all on performance for

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.179 
out in in oil all on performance for
spaces

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.759 

performance<00:00:25.189> of<00:00:25.490> these<00:00:25.759> it<00:00:26.509> shows<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.410> their

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
performance of these it shows that their

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.530 
performance of these it shows that their
level<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:29.050> ability<00:00:30.369> training<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:31.579> it's<00:00:32.449> a

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
level of ability training and it's a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.000 
level of ability training and it's a
little<00:00:32.750> bit<00:00:32.870> more<00:00:32.989> it's<00:00:33.320> on<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.440> point<00:00:33.739> secure

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
little bit more it's on a point secure

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.119 
little bit more it's on a point secure
basis<00:00:34.519> as<00:00:34.760> per<00:00:35.269> movement<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.620> feel<00:00:36.920> that

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
basis as per movement and I feel that

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.759 
basis as per movement and I feel that
these<00:00:37.370> horses<00:00:37.610> then<00:00:38.090> can<00:00:38.600> show<00:00:39.320> off<00:00:39.530> their

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
these horses then can show off their

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.240 
these horses then can show off their
talent<00:00:40.220> and<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.030> riders<00:00:41.480> are<00:00:42.100> showing<00:00:43.100> off

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
talent and the riders are showing off

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.920 
talent and the riders are showing off
how<00:00:43.460> much<00:00:43.670> work<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.180> effort<00:00:44.300> they've<00:00:44.659> had<00:00:44.839> to

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
how much work and effort they've had to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.049 
how much work and effort they've had to
put<00:00:45.110> in<00:00:45.199> there<00:00:45.409> is<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:46.070> perception<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:47.000> the

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
put in there is a perception of the

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.450 
put in there is a perception of the
challenge<00:00:47.540> patterns<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.890> it<00:00:49.040> shows<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
challenge patterns that it shows the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.520 
challenge patterns that it shows the
level<00:00:49.729> of<00:00:49.850> competition<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.780> level<00:00:51.199> of

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
level of competition and the level of

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.049 
level of competition and the level of
training<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:52.010> these<00:00:52.190> young<00:00:52.399> horses<00:00:52.729> have<00:00:52.909> had

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
training of these young horses have had

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.910 
training of these young horses have had
on<00:00:53.210> them<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:53.720> think<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.079> probably<00:00:54.409> bodes

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
on them and I think it probably bodes

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.259 
on them and I think it probably bodes
well<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:56.000> these<00:00:56.449> sort<00:00:56.809> of<00:00:56.870> movements<00:00:57.500> and

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
well that these sort of movements and

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.930 
well that these sort of movements and
required<00:00:59.269> specific<00:01:00.230> skills<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
required specific skills and that the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.479 
required specific skills and that the
horses<00:01:02.359> have<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.600> level<00:01:03.050> of<00:01:03.199> training<00:01:03.739> that

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
horses have a level of training that

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.600 
horses have a level of training that
doesn't<00:01:04.789> make<00:01:05.239> them<00:01:05.420> hot<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:05.840> silly<00:01:06.080> they<00:01:07.070> do

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
doesn't make them hot and silly they do

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.370 
doesn't make them hot and silly they do
all<00:01:07.759> these<00:01:07.940> movements<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.630> they<00:01:08.780> get<00:01:08.929> points

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
all these movements and they get points

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.889 
all these movements and they get points
scores<00:01:09.770> out<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:10.039> ten<00:01:10.399> for<00:01:10.729> each<00:01:10.850> movement<00:01:11.179> so

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
scores out of ten for each movement so

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.770 
scores out of ten for each movement so
it's<00:01:12.200> not<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.380> one<00:01:12.560> out<00:01:12.800> one<00:01:13.550> you<00:01:14.060> know<00:01:14.179> mistaken

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's not a one out one you know mistaken

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.469 
it's not a one out one you know mistaken
out<00:01:14.960> well<00:01:15.409> when<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.039> judge<00:01:16.250> these<00:01:16.520> events

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
out well when we judge these events

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.600 
out well when we judge these events
we're<00:01:17.630> looking<00:01:17.869> for<00:01:18.050> precision<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:19.369> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
we're looking for precision of the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.960 
we're looking for precision of the
movement<00:01:20.030> at<00:01:20.179> marker<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:22.159> connoisseur

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
movement at marker and a connoisseur

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.240 
movement at marker and a connoisseur
collectiveness<00:01:23.500> promised<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.679> their<00:01:24.830> workout

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
collectiveness promised in their workout

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.309 
collectiveness promised in their workout
and<00:01:25.490> obedience

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
and obedience

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.440 
and obedience
so<00:01:27.319> each<00:01:27.590> maneuver<00:01:28.009> is<00:01:28.310> marked<00:01:28.640> individually

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
so each maneuver is marked individually

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.480 
so each maneuver is marked individually
so<00:01:29.600> if<00:01:29.750> they<00:01:29.899> do<00:01:29.960> actually<00:01:30.259> not<00:01:31.040> do<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.250> maneuver

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
so if they do actually not do a maneuver

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.280 
so if they do actually not do a maneuver
particularly<00:01:32.149> well<00:01:32.299> they<00:01:32.479> can<00:01:32.659> ride<00:01:32.840> on<00:01:33.049> and

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
particularly well they can ride on and

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.460 
particularly well they can ride on and
then<00:01:34.100> may<00:01:34.600> provide<00:01:35.600> me<00:01:35.810> with<00:01:35.930> an<00:01:36.079> excellent

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
then may provide me with an excellent

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.990 
then may provide me with an excellent
workout<00:01:36.770> for<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.040> rest<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.340> them<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:37.850> not

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
workout for the rest of them so it's not

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.270 
workout for the rest of them so it's not
a<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.450> twenty<00:01:38.840> an<00:01:39.110> hour<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.560> know<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:40.130> they

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
a one in twenty an hour you know if they

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.399 
a one in twenty an hour you know if they
make<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> mistake<00:01:40.729> in<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:41.149> section<00:01:41.570> they<00:01:42.229> can

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
make a mistake in one section they can

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.109 
make a mistake in one section they can
make<00:01:42.590> up<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.920> point<00:01:43.189> scores<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.759> further

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
make up the point scores in further

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.959 
make up the point scores in further
sections<00:01:44.570> if<00:01:44.719> they<00:01:45.340> follow<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.490> workout<00:01:46.880> and

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
sections if they follow the workout and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.070 
sections if they follow the workout and
do<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.119> good<00:01:47.270> job

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
do a good job

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.340 
do a good job
you<00:01:48.140> know<00:01:48.260> basically<00:01:49.040> we<00:01:49.250> need<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:50.240> show<00:01:51.140> the

you know basically we need to show the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.800 
you know basically we need to show the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
education and as I said they don't have

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.630 
education and as I said they don't have
to<00:01:53.990> do

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
screeching hot hole you know holding

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.430 
screeching hot hole you know holding
sort<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.430> stops<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:59.030> just<00:01:59.390> want<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.630> see<00:01:59.750> them<00:01:59.990> to
