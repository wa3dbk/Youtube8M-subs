best best rift car there is in this game

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.040 
best best rift car there is in this game
I<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.960> almost<00:00:18.960> almost<00:00:19.560> set<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> max

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
I have it almost almost set to the max

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.800 
I have it almost almost set to the max

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so it's about it's as powerful as it
