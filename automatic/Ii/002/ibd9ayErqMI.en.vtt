00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
things such as an infotainment system

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:15.960 
things such as an infotainment system
and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.990 
and
a little<00:02:16.330> slightly<00:02:16.690> more<00:02:16.840> luxurious

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
a little slightly more luxurious

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.490 
a little slightly more luxurious
interior<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.270> such<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:19.870> from<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.140> strict

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
interior and such but from a strict

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.190 
interior and such but from a strict
performance<00:02:21.190> standpoint<00:02:22.200> they're

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
performance standpoint they're

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.470 
performance standpoint they're
neck-and-neck<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:24.250> mean<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.060> Boxster

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
neck-and-neck I mean the Boxster

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.090 
neck-and-neck I mean the Boxster
probably<00:02:25.750> has<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.170> bit<00:02:26.440> more<00:02:26.500> balance

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
probably has a little bit more balance

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.890 
probably has a little bit more balance
and<00:02:27.250> slightly<00:02:27.670> more<00:02:27.880> practicality<00:02:28.600> with<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and slightly more practicality with the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.660 
and slightly more practicality with the
two<00:02:29.050> trunks<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.950> long<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> only<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.640> me

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
two trunks as long as you only have me

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.820

two people in the car

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.820
