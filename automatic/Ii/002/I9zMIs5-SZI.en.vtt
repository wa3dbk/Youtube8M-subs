the image and wash it out a little bit

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
the image and wash it out a little bit
but<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.640> wasn't<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> case<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780

let's take a look at it when we play the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
let's take a look at it when we play the
same<00:01:19.860> game<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.549> Nintendo<00:01:21.119> 3ds<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:23.509> as<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
can see here on a 3d s it seems to be

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
can see here on a 3d s it seems to be
just<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.500> a

just a little bit off you can see a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560 
just a little bit off you can see a

little bit of pixelation not that it's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.819 
little bit of pixelation not that it's
going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> bother<00:01:30.930> too<00:01:31.259> much<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.799> can

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
going to bother too much but you can

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
going to bother too much but you can
definitely<00:01:32.369> notice<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.150> any<00:01:33.720> difference

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
definitely notice it in any difference

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.630 
definitely notice it in any difference
between<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.920> playing<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> deer

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
slide hardware and the DSi XL are aware
I'm<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.460> sure<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> screen<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.540> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
I'm not sure if that's the screen or it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
I'm not sure if that's the screen or it
could<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.930> possibly<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> Nintendo<00:01:41.880> 3ds

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
could be possibly that the Nintendo 3ds

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960 
could be possibly that the Nintendo 3ds
is<00:01:42.720> emulating<00:01:43.409> DS<00:01:43.590> Hardware<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.700> using<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
is emulating DS Hardware so it's using a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.999 
is emulating DS Hardware so it's using a
software<00:01:45.390> emulator<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
software emulator to do that and you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
software emulator to do that and you
know<00:01:47.159> usually<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.790> using<00:01:48.090> software

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
know usually when using software

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
know usually when using software
emulators<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> degrade<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.130> quality

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
emulators you get a degrade in quality

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.130 
emulators you get a degrade in quality
so<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.939> could<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> reasons<00:01:51.780> why

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so that could be one of the reasons why

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.910 
so that could be one of the reasons why
the<00:01:52.200> game

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499

game in its native resolution which I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.199 
game in its native resolution which I
feel<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> little<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.370> too<00:02:11.520> small<00:02:11.700> playing

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
feel just a little bit too small playing

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.839 
feel just a little bit too small playing
on<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
on the

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.179 
on the
Nintendo<00:02:13.359> 3ds<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.109> even<00:02:14.590> still<00:02:14.859> that<00:02:14.890> still

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
Nintendo 3ds and even still that still

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.800 
Nintendo 3ds and even still that still
seems<00:02:15.430> like<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.760> quality's<00:02:16.269> just<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> little

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
seems like the quality's just a little

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.229 
seems like the quality's just a little
bit<00:02:16.900> off<00:02:17.079> there<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:18.129> I'm<00:02:18.519> not<00:02:18.700> quite<00:02:18.999> sure<00:02:19.030> if

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
bit off there so I'm not quite sure if

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.149 
bit off there so I'm not quite sure if
it<00:02:19.599> is<00:02:19.749> software<00:02:20.170> emulation<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.859> the<00:02:20.980> issue

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
it is software emulation it is the issue

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.949 
it is software emulation it is the issue
issue<00:02:21.459> there<00:02:21.909> but<00:02:22.150> that's<00:02:22.359> just<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.749> thought

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
issue there but that's just one thought

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.229 
issue there but that's just one thought
to<00:02:23.109> put<00:02:23.230> out<00:02:23.379> there<00:02:23.639> now<00:02:24.639> that<00:02:24.819> doesn't<00:02:25.090> happen

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
to put out there now that doesn't happen

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.000 
to put out there now that doesn't happen

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
here I did try with ninja gaiden dragon

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.890 
here I did try with ninja gaiden dragon
saw<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:30.849> found<00:02:31.030> two<00:02:31.299> things<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:31.689> this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
while the game looked right you have to

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.289 
while the game looked right you have to
notice<00:02:34.870> games<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:36.189> have<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.519> turn<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.969> d

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
different size you can see that it's

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.740
