 Hi all of me from Reflection Nirvana, 

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:09.899
 This time I will explain about the Face Trigger Function. 

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:21.766
 In general, the face is divided into 5 areas that are controlled by the organs in our body, namely 

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:32.799
 Forehead (area for the heart), Left cheek (area for the liver), Right cheek (area for the lungs), 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.200
 Nose (area for spleen) and Chin (area for kidney). 

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:51.733
 There are several full-face facial functions that show disturbances of organs in the body, for example: 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.200
 1. Point The root of the nose between the two eyebrows serves to cure the cough. 

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:10.632
 2. The end point of the outer eyebrow and the tip of the outer eye reach the ear hole 

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:17.633
 serves to reduce premature wrinkles around the eyes and all types of eye disorders. 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.366
 3. The point in front of the ear hole can cure facial skin disorders, 

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:32.166
 reducing appetite can even reduce weight. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.866
 4. The nose point on the edge of the nostril left and right 

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:48.199
 function to cure respiratory disorders such as runny nose, sneezing, toothache. 

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:54.899
 5. The point between the upper lip and nose 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.866
 serves to eliminate headache, tension, balance disorders, zits. 

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:13.266
