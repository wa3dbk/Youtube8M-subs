00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.250 
low it should be stretched a bit more as
you<00:03:38.900> can<00:03:39.019> see<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:39.440> much<00:03:39.699> bigger<00:03:40.699> here<00:03:41.260> it

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
you can see it's much bigger here it

but<00:03:54.739> wearing<00:03:54.949> me<00:03:55.189> to<00:03:55.340> this<00:03:55.459> part<00:03:56.349> see<00:03:57.349> it's

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
but wearing me to this part see it's

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.089 
but wearing me to this part see it's
totally<00:03:58.069> not<00:03:58.519> square<00:03:59.650> dead<00:04:00.650> giveaway<00:04:01.069> that

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
totally not square dead giveaway that

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.320 
totally not square dead giveaway that
it's<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.459> fake

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.790 

well<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.380> material<00:04:05.950> feels<00:04:06.580> very<00:04:06.820> feldy<00:04:07.800> well

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
well the material feels very feldy well

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.370 
well the material feels very feldy well
I<00:04:09.010> think<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.520> lot<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.730> recent<00:04:10.390> mics<00:04:10.600> actually

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
I think a lot of recent mics actually

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.290 
I think a lot of recent mics actually
feel<00:04:11.590> like<00:04:11.830> that<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.520> maybe<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:13.000> isn't<00:04:13.240> the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
feel like that so maybe that isn't the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.620 
feel like that so maybe that isn't the
best<00:04:13.630> way<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.860> tell<00:04:15.570> but<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:18.640> if<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.450> just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
best way to to tell but so if you just

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.530 
best way to to tell but so if you just
remember<00:04:19.900> those<00:04:20.230> main<00:04:21.010> points<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.610> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
remember those main points that the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.880 
remember those main points that the
world<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.170> tag<00:04:24.270> stitched<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
world it in tag stitched in so the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.470 
world it in tag stitched in so the
dimples<00:04:27.540> underneath<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.720> insole<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.480> sort

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
dimples underneath the insole and sort

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.940 
dimples underneath the insole and sort
of<00:04:31.600> crappy<00:04:32.170> insole

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
of crappy insole

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.380 
of crappy insole
they're<00:04:33.670> usually<00:04:34.080> best<00:04:35.080> ways<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.680> air

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
they're usually best ways of air

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.860 
they're usually best ways of air

spotting the fake air max ones this one

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.550 
spotting the fake air max ones this one
isn't<00:04:43.870> much<00:04:44.470> better<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:46.050> mean<00:04:47.050> if<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.320> look

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
isn't much better I mean if you look

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.380 
isn't much better I mean if you look
closely<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.310> probably<00:04:48.670> can't<00:04:48.940> see<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:51.360> lot<00:04:52.360> of
