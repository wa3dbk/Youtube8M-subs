especially adding details to the nose so

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.120 
especially adding details to the nose so
here<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.219> are<00:00:14.660> this<00:00:15.660> could<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:16.440> or<00:00:16.740> three

part lesson about just adding nostrils
and<00:00:21.689> some<00:00:22.410> details<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> nose<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:23.760> we

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and some details to the nose which we

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.179 
and some details to the nose which we
left<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.779> thought<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.529> guys<00:00:25.710> should<00:00:25.769> be

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
left I was I thought you guys should be

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.759 
left I was I thought you guys should be
able<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> figure<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.269> since<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
able to figure it out but since I got so

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.189 
able to figure it out but since I got so
many<00:00:28.920> messages<00:00:29.460> i<00:00:29.550> thought<00:00:29.789> okay<00:00:30.090> i<00:00:30.119> should<00:00:31.019> i

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
many messages i thought okay i should i

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.000 
many messages i thought okay i should i
should<00:00:31.289> maybe<00:00:32.090> do<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> couple<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.440> let's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
should maybe do a couple more so let's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.729 
should maybe do a couple more so let's
get<00:00:35.190> started<00:00:35.420> first<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.410> i<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
get started first thing what i want to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.229 
get started first thing what i want to
do<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.890> maybe<00:00:38.550> add<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:42.090> know

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
do is maybe add one more you know

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.139 
do is maybe add one more you know
segment<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.920> edges<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.940> let's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
segment or some more edges here so let's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.340 
segment or some more edges here so let's
start<00:00:45.450> by<00:00:45.660> selecting<00:00:46.879> these<00:00:47.879> guys<00:00:48.350> holding

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
start by selecting these guys holding

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
start by selecting these guys holding
down<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> control<00:00:50.010> key<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.760> selected<00:00:51.270> four

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
down the control key just selected four

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.189 
down the control key just selected four
edges<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.260> connect<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.899> i'm<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
edges and connect and then i'm going to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.520 
edges and connect and then i'm going to
jump<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.800> word<00:00:56.070> ex<00:00:56.309> mode<00:00:57.260> select<00:00:58.260> these<00:00:58.469> two

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
jump to my word ex mode select these two

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.660 
jump to my word ex mode select these two
vertices<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.660> connect<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:01.399> alright<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
vertices and connect them alright so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
vertices and connect them alright so
this<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.780> edge<00:01:04.049> coming<00:01:04.500> all

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this way we have this edge coming all

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.149 
this way we have this edge coming all
the<00:01:04.860> way<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.570> knows<00:01:07.159> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the way and you know going to knows you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
the way and you know going to knows you
would<00:01:08.310> notice<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.880> ended<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.210> having<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
would notice we ended up having a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.410 
would notice we ended up having a
triangle<00:01:10.340> don't<00:01:11.340> worry<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.790> would<00:01:12.000> come<00:01:12.240> back

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
triangle don't worry we would come back

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.230 
triangle don't worry we would come back
and<00:01:12.720> fix<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> later<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.460> let's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and fix that later on but for now let's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
and fix that later on but for now let's
go<00:01:15.479> ahead<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> start<00:01:16.049> moving<00:01:16.320> these<00:01:16.650> new

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
go ahead and start moving these new

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399 
go ahead and start moving these new
points<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.700> had<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.960> i'm<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
points we just had it so i'm going to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.160 
points we just had it so i'm going to
select<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:19.979> guys<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.820> move<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> like

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
select these two guys and move it like

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.730 
select these two guys and move it like
this<00:01:22.850> giving<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.330> round<00:01:24.900> shape<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this giving a bit round shape to the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.340 
this giving a bit round shape to the
nose<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.820> again<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:28.020> i'm<00:01:28.170> not

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
nose and again you you know i'm not

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.319 
nose and again you you know i'm not
using<00:01:28.590> any<00:01:28.860> difference<00:01:29.220> images<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
using any difference images so if you

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.819 
using any difference images so if you
have<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> probably<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
have one you probably would want to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.359 
have one you probably would want to
match<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.270> using<00:01:34.130> but<00:01:35.130> these

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
match to the one you are using but these

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
match to the one you are using but these
guys<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.939> constraining<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> edges

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
guys are not constraining to the edges

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.280 
guys are not constraining to the edges
I'm<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.799> moving<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.280> around<00:01:38.720> freely<00:01:39.720> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I'm just moving them around freely so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.999 
I'm just moving them around freely so
let's<00:01:40.590> grab<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.100> guy<00:01:42.229> move<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.470> something

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
let's grab this guy move it something

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.660 
let's grab this guy move it something
like<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.890> alright<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:49.070> I'm<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> start

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
like this alright and I'm going to start

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
like this alright and I'm going to start
by<00:01:50.960> selecting<00:01:53.479> let's<00:01:54.479> say<00:01:57.079> these<00:01:58.130> six

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
by selecting let's say these six

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.660 
by selecting let's say these six
vertices<00:02:00.469> constrain<00:02:01.469> them<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> edges<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
vertices constrain them to edges and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.990 
vertices constrain them to edges and
then<00:02:03.240> move<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.490> that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
then move them a little bit like that

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.520 
then move them a little bit like that
and<00:02:07.150> then<00:02:07.750> work<00:02:08.050> on<00:02:08.350> them<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.950> by<00:02:09.190> one<00:02:10.530> let's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and then work on them one by one let's

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:21.840 
and then work on them one by one let's
see<00:02:14.490> should<00:02:15.490> be<00:02:15.790> good<00:02:16.030> enough<00:02:17.910> okay<00:02:20.850> maybe

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
see should be good enough okay maybe

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.710 
see should be good enough okay maybe
this<00:02:22.120> guy<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.690> come<00:02:22.930> here<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:25.330> i'm<00:02:25.480> not

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
this guy can come here and again i'm not

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.560 
this guy can come here and again i'm not
spending<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.350> lot<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.530> time<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:27.450> fixing<00:02:28.450> the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
spending a lot of time in fixing the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.540 
spending a lot of time in fixing the
proper<00:02:28.900> shape<00:02:29.080> here<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:32.100> that's<00:02:33.100> good<00:02:33.370> for

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
proper shape here but that's good for

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.090 
proper shape here but that's good for
now<00:02:33.610> let's<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.420> ahead<00:02:34.600> by<00:02:34.810> adding<00:02:35.290> some<00:02:35.890> more

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
now let's go ahead by adding some more

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.650 
now let's go ahead by adding some more
details<00:02:37.800> what<00:02:38.800> i<00:02:38.830> want<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.190> do<00:02:39.340> first<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.970> throw

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
details what i want to do first is throw

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
details what i want to do first is throw
in<00:02:40.840> some<00:02:41.110> more<00:02:41.320> edges<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.920> work<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.430> and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
in some more edges to work with and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.540 
in some more edges to work with and
let's<00:02:45.400> start<00:02:46.920> go<00:02:47.920> back<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.340> our<00:02:48.550> edge<00:02:48.850> mode<00:02:49.150> and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
let's start go back to our edge mode and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.160 
let's start go back to our edge mode and
what<00:02:51.550> i'm<00:02:51.700> going<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:51.940> do<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.120> select<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.959> edge

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
what i'm going to do is select this edge

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.800 
what i'm going to do is select this edge
here<00:02:54.060> ctrl<00:02:55.060> key<00:02:57.000> select<00:02:58.000> these<00:02:58.270> three<00:02:58.600> guys

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
here ctrl key select these three guys

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.850 
here ctrl key select these three guys
and<00:02:59.200> then<00:02:59.440> go<00:02:59.680> up<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.860> this

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
and then go up like that in this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.420 
and then go up like that in this
direction<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:04.709> then<00:03:05.709> go<00:03:06.010> around<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:07.390> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
direction and then go around like that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.000 
direction and then go around like that
so<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.640> total<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.180> should<00:03:10.600> have<00:03:10.870> nine<00:03:11.530> edges

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
so in total we should have nine edges

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.670 
so in total we should have nine edges
selected<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.880> again<00:03:13.420> get<00:03:13.900> in<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.200> habit<00:03:14.410> of

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
selected and again get in the habit of

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.229 
selected and again get in the habit of
keeping<00:03:15.190> your<00:03:15.549> eyes<00:03:15.730> here<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:18.239> confirming

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
keeping your eyes here for confirming

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.350 
keeping your eyes here for confirming
the<00:03:19.390> right<00:03:19.570> selection<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.250> let's<00:03:22.090> go<00:03:22.269> ahead

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
the right selection and let's go ahead

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.430 
the right selection and let's go ahead
and<00:03:22.450> connect<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:25.450> would<00:03:25.630> end<00:03:25.900> up<00:03:26.080> with

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and connect it and you would end up with

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.300 
and connect it and you would end up with
something<00:03:26.830> like<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:28.170> nice<00:03:29.170> H<00:03:29.440> going<00:03:29.950> from

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
something like this a nice H going from

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.710 
something like this a nice H going from
hair<00:03:30.970> all<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.299> way<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.630> here<00:03:32.310> okay<00:03:33.720> let's

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
hair all the way to here okay let's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.460 
hair all the way to here okay let's
start<00:03:35.440> moving<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.220> around<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.640> little<00:03:36.670> bit<00:03:37.470> so

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
start moving it around a little bit so

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.289 
start moving it around a little bit so
again<00:03:38.980> I'm<00:03:39.130> going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.430> work<00:03:39.549> on<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.970> bottom

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
again I'm going to work on the bottom

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.630 
again I'm going to work on the bottom
part<00:03:40.480> here<00:03:40.930> still<00:03:41.590> constraining<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.489> the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
part here still constraining it to the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.229 
part here still constraining it to the
edge<00:03:43.110> hold<00:03:44.110> down<00:03:44.530> ctrl<00:03:45.130> key<00:03:45.430> these<00:03:45.820> two<00:03:46.060> edges

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
edge hold down ctrl key these two edges

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:54.800 
edge hold down ctrl key these two edges
can<00:03:46.660> go<00:03:47.640> like<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:50.310> jump<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.579> vertex<00:03:52.120> mode

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:05.490 

like<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:57.720> ok<00:03:58.720> let's<00:03:59.440> go<00:03:59.680> down<00:04:04.500> something

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
like that ok let's go down something

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:15.349 
like that ok let's go down something
like<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:07.350> go<00:04:08.350> up<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:10.840> that

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.719 

so<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.539> can<00:04:16.840> go<00:04:17.019> here<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.329> that's<00:04:19.329> good<00:04:19.600> for<00:04:19.630> now

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
so I can go here and that's good for now

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.700 
so I can go here and that's good for now
so<00:04:21.840> let's<00:04:22.840> see<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.389> bottom<00:04:25.750> level<00:04:26.080> here<00:04:26.470> a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
so let's see at the bottom level here a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.730 
so let's see at the bottom level here a
triangle<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.669> five-sided<00:04:28.330> poly<00:04:28.630> but<00:04:29.560> we

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
triangle and a five-sided poly but we

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.129 
triangle and a five-sided poly but we
would<00:04:29.919> be<00:04:30.190> adding<00:04:30.490> more<00:04:30.520> details<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.509> take

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
would be adding more details and take

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.100 
would be adding more details and take
care<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.710> issue<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.970> let's<00:04:34.210> select<00:04:34.419> one

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
care of this issue so let's select one

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.790 
care of this issue so let's select one
two<00:04:35.680> three<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:37.060> then<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.410> one<00:04:39.509> connect<00:04:40.800> okay

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
two three and then this one connect okay

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.320 
two three and then this one connect okay
so<00:04:42.669> we<00:04:42.880> ended<00:04:43.150> up<00:04:43.330> with<00:04:43.660> something<00:04:44.229> like<00:04:44.410> this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
so we ended up with something like this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.629 
so we ended up with something like this
okay<00:04:46.330> let's<00:04:46.690> move<00:04:46.930> some<00:04:47.259> more<00:04:47.470> points<00:04:47.710> around

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:05:01.320 

like<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:55.240> here<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:59.070> if<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.729> simply

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
like that or here and if I simply

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.210 
like that or here and if I simply
connect<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:02.650> vertex<00:05:03.220> with<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:03.820> guy<00:05:04.060> here

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
connect this vertex with this guy here

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.320 
connect this vertex with this guy here
we<00:05:06.220> at<00:05:06.370> least<00:05:06.580> two<00:05:07.150> pair<00:05:07.449> off<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:09.000> multi<00:05:10.000> sided

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
we at least two pair off the multi sided

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.540 
we at least two pair off the multi sided
polygon<00:05:10.810> here<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.289> ended<00:05:11.530> up<00:05:11.650> with<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:11.949> to

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
polygon here and ended up with the to

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.839 
polygon here and ended up with the to
court<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:14.050> courts<00:05:14.500> which<00:05:14.919> is<00:05:15.220> probably<00:05:15.610> what

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
court to courts which is probably what

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.490 
court to courts which is probably what
we<00:05:16.060> need<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:17.580> let's<00:05:18.580> move<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:19.060> guy<00:05:19.300> around

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
we need and let's move this guy around

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.070 
we need and let's move this guy around
something<00:05:20.500> like<00:05:20.680> this<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.840> everything<00:05:22.840> looks

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
something like this and everything looks

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.379 
something like this and everything looks
okay<00:05:23.500> except<00:05:23.979> this<00:05:24.159> big<00:05:24.400> triangle<00:05:24.909> here<00:05:25.150> which

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
okay except this big triangle here which

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.870 
okay except this big triangle here which
I'm<00:05:25.659> not<00:05:25.900> going<00:05:26.199> to<00:05:26.289> worry<00:05:26.470> about<00:05:26.639> because<00:05:27.639> we

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
I'm not going to worry about because we

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.770 
I'm not going to worry about because we
are<00:05:28.419> going<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.810> extrude<00:05:29.289> this<00:05:29.590> inside<00:05:30.099> and

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
are going to extrude this inside and

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.990 
are going to extrude this inside and
what<00:05:31.780> we<00:05:31.960> can<00:05:32.139> do<00:05:32.320> here<00:05:32.530> is<00:05:32.800> simply<00:05:33.190> select

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
what we can do here is simply select

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.430 
what we can do here is simply select
this<00:05:34.180> edge<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:35.190> remove<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.720> so<00:05:37.720> now<00:05:37.900> we<00:05:37.960> have<00:05:38.260> a

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
this edge and remove it so now we have a

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.920 
this edge and remove it so now we have a
big<00:05:38.800> five-sided<00:05:39.729> polygon<00:05:39.760> which<00:05:40.539> we<00:05:40.780> would

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
big five-sided polygon which we would

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.710 
big five-sided polygon which we would
extort<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:41.500> sight<00:05:41.770> but<00:05:42.539> overhear<00:05:43.539> everything

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
extort in sight but overhear everything

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.520 
extort in sight but overhear everything
looks<00:05:44.199> like<00:05:44.440> court<00:05:44.919> which<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.520> what<00:05:45.699> we<00:05:45.880> want

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
looks like court which is what we want

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.980 
looks like court which is what we want
all<00:05:47.530> right<00:05:47.800> let<00:05:48.669> me<00:05:48.699> pause<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.240> video<00:05:49.389> just<00:05:49.870> to

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
all right let me pause the video just to

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.300 
all right let me pause the video just to
check<00:05:50.639> how<00:05:51.639> much<00:05:51.820> time<00:05:53.070> hope<00:05:54.070> I'm<00:05:54.280> not

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
check how much time hope I'm not

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.430 
check how much time hope I'm not
reaching<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:54.880> 10-minute<00:05:55.449> limit<00:05:55.630> give<00:05:56.260> me<00:05:56.409> a

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
reaching the 10-minute limit give me a

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.080 
reaching the 10-minute limit give me a
second<00:05:57.750> okay<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:59.380> I've<00:05:59.680> got<00:05:59.889> four<00:06:00.849> more

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
second okay so I've got four more

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.740 
second okay so I've got four more
minutes<00:06:02.340> so<00:06:03.340> yes<00:06:03.550> definitely<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.360> would<00:06:04.510> be<00:06:04.720> a

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
minutes so yes definitely it would be a

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.850 
minutes so yes definitely it would be a
two-part<00:06:05.229> video<00:06:05.820> at<00:06:06.820> least<00:06:07.320> so<00:06:08.320> let's<00:06:08.590> see

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
two-part video at least so let's see

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.550 
two-part video at least so let's see
what<00:06:09.159> I<00:06:10.090> want<00:06:10.300> to<00:06:10.389> do<00:06:10.539> at<00:06:10.720> this<00:06:10.930> point<00:06:10.990> is<00:06:13.560> maybe

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
what I want to do at this point is maybe

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.409 
what I want to do at this point is maybe
start<00:06:15.419> or<00:06:17.009> before<00:06:18.009> i<00:06:18.250> move<00:06:18.940> things<00:06:19.240> around

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
start or before i move things around

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.129 
start or before i move things around
maybe<00:06:19.960> add<00:06:20.289> some<00:06:20.320> more<00:06:20.889> edges<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:22.300> go<00:06:22.900> back<00:06:23.080> to

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
maybe add some more edges so go back to

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.830 
maybe add some more edges so go back to
the<00:06:23.440> edge<00:06:23.590> mode

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
the edge mode

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.700 
the edge mode
and<00:06:26.050> I'm<00:06:26.650> going<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:26.889> select<00:06:27.130> this<00:06:27.400> guy<00:06:27.790> here

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
and I'm going to select this guy here

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:35.129 
and I'm going to select this guy here
ctrl<00:06:29.710> key<00:06:30.100> one<00:06:30.880> two<00:06:31.510> three<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.470> four<00:06:34.139> these

ctrl key one two three and four these

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.480 
ctrl key one two three and four these
four<00:06:35.500> edges<00:06:35.740> I'm<00:06:36.280> going<00:06:36.669> to<00:06:36.760> connect<00:06:38.490> okay

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
four edges I'm going to connect okay

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.100 
four edges I'm going to connect okay
adding<00:06:40.919> this<00:06:41.919> guy<00:06:42.280> here<00:06:42.760> and<00:06:42.970> then<00:06:43.570> I'm<00:06:43.900> going

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
adding this guy here and then I'm going

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.820 
adding this guy here and then I'm going
to<00:06:44.199> jump<00:06:44.500> to<00:06:44.770> my<00:06:44.979> word<00:06:45.340> x-mode<00:06:46.530> connect<00:06:47.530> these

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
to jump to my word x-mode connect these

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.590 
to jump to my word x-mode connect these
two<00:06:48.130> guys<00:06:48.840> like<00:06:49.840> that<00:06:51.000> okay<00:06:52.000> everything<00:06:52.510> is

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
two guys like that okay everything is

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.360 
two guys like that okay everything is
good<00:06:52.960> two<00:06:53.590> triangles<00:06:54.250> and<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.760> five-sided<00:06:55.449> poly

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
good two triangles and a five-sided poly

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.570 
good two triangles and a five-sided poly
pretty<00:06:57.370> easy<00:06:57.610> to<00:06:57.820> fix<00:06:58.290> the<00:06:59.290> triangle<00:06:59.860> we<00:07:00.370> can

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
pretty easy to fix the triangle we can

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.100 
pretty easy to fix the triangle we can
simply<00:07:01.180> remove<00:07:01.990> this<00:07:02.440> middle<00:07:02.950> edge<00:07:03.910> and<00:07:04.389> end

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
simply remove this middle edge and end

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.400 
simply remove this middle edge and end
up<00:07:05.410> with<00:07:05.650> a<00:07:05.680> cord<00:07:06.360> good<00:07:07.360> enough<00:07:07.630> now<00:07:07.990> we<00:07:08.050> have<00:07:08.380> a

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
up with a cord good enough now we have a

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:15.540 
up with a cord good enough now we have a
five<00:07:08.740> sided<00:07:09.010> poly<00:07:09.490> and<00:07:09.910> a<00:07:10.120> trial<00:07:14.130> the<00:07:15.130> easiest

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
five sided poly and a trial the easiest

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.719 
five sided poly and a trial the easiest
way<00:07:15.880> to<00:07:15.940> fix<00:07:16.240> that<00:07:16.510> is<00:07:16.570> if<00:07:17.200> we<00:07:17.860> jump<00:07:18.400> to<00:07:18.490> the

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
way to fix that is if we jump to the

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:23.120 
way to fix that is if we jump to the
insert<00:07:19.120> vertex<00:07:19.720> mode<00:07:20.340> turn<00:07:21.340> on<00:07:21.550> the<00:07:22.060> snap<00:07:22.450> add

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
insert vertex mode turn on the snap add

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.240 
insert vertex mode turn on the snap add
one<00:07:24.130> vertex<00:07:24.520> here<00:07:25.470> right<00:07:26.470> click<00:07:26.740> to<00:07:26.979> finish

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
one vertex here right click to finish

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.779 
one vertex here right click to finish
get<00:07:27.820> out<00:07:27.970> of<00:07:28.120> the<00:07:28.300> snap<00:07:28.630> mode<00:07:29.400> go<00:07:30.400> to<00:07:30.460> the<00:07:30.639> mo

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
get out of the snap mode go to the mo

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:35.430 
get out of the snap mode go to the mo
vortex<00:07:31.240> level<00:07:31.620> and<00:07:32.850> connect<00:07:33.850> it<00:07:34.169> with<00:07:35.169> this

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 
vortex level and connect it with this

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.800 
vortex level and connect it with this
guy<00:07:35.710> adding<00:07:36.190> this<00:07:36.310> new<00:07:36.580> edge<00:07:36.850> and<00:07:37.410> that<00:07:38.410> way<00:07:39.810> if

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
guy adding this new edge and that way if

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.279 
guy adding this new edge and that way if
I<00:07:40.960> get<00:07:41.229> out<00:07:41.380> of<00:07:41.410> my<00:07:42.450> edge<00:07:43.450> constrained<00:07:44.050> mode

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.289 
I get out of my edge constrained mode

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.050 
I get out of my edge constrained mode
and<00:07:44.590> move<00:07:44.740> it<00:07:44.919> a<00:07:45.010> little<00:07:45.039> bit<00:07:45.490> you<00:07:45.849> would

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
and move it a little bit you would

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.420 
and move it a little bit you would
notice<00:07:46.270> we<00:07:46.900> took<00:07:47.229> care<00:07:47.289> of<00:07:47.500> that<00:07:47.650> triangle<00:07:48.070> and

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.430 
notice we took care of that triangle and

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.990 
notice we took care of that triangle and
have<00:07:49.210> all<00:07:49.479> the<00:07:49.690> quads<00:07:49.960> to<00:07:50.229> work<00:07:50.410> with<00:07:50.849> so<00:07:51.849> I'm

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 
have all the quads to work with so I'm

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.060 
have all the quads to work with so I'm
going<00:07:52.030> to<00:07:52.240> stop<00:07:52.539> this<00:07:52.570> video<00:07:53.139> for<00:07:53.380> now<00:07:53.560> and<00:07:53.889> in

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.070 
going to stop this video for now and in

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.790 
going to stop this video for now and in
part<00:07:54.370> 2<00:07:54.610> we're<00:07:54.940> going<00:07:54.970> to<00:07:55.210> start<00:07:55.479> moving<00:07:55.800> these

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 
part 2 we're going to start moving these

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.370 
part 2 we're going to start moving these
new<00:07:57.160> word<00:07:57.400> asees<00:07:57.729> around<00:07:58.060> and<00:07:58.389> give<00:07:59.200> it<00:07:59.320> a

00:07:59.370 --> 00:07:59.380 
new word asees around and give it a

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.990 
new word asees around and give it a
shape<00:07:59.789> I'll<00:08:00.789> see<00:08:01.300> you<00:08:01.389> in<00:08:01.510> part<00:08:01.780> two
