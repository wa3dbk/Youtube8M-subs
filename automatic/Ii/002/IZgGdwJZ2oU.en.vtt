 the goal is this way that first is to give all other 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.210
 personal information his photo besides the work on the aspect 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.379
 what is the principle these two 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.029
 of the minutions a number of players using 2 the pistolero c 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.070
 is you in five years it looks like that 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.920
 a life-size role-play organized throughout the city the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.920
 registered players must eliminate targets from pistolero while remaining 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.240
 very even want a stalking rather good child proposed upstream of the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.090
 festival the key to the polar at first sight not enough to whip a cat and 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.940
 yet at the last city council the opposition will denounce the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 dashed terms in the report of the culture commission events in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.340
 game the award of a grant this particular animation will be launched a 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.860
 months before the event and will allow teens to experience moments of 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.750
 adventure 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 by simulating murders armed with water guns 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 thirty years of course the elected 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.530
 and the lives of surrogate mothers be arrested moral values 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.120
 but it is unacceptable for us in a period when 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.320
 violence in schools 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.130
 those that life is stronger in the wait games I believe that if we 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370
 had written 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.780
 aim a battle since m 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.290
 euros in the city 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.300
 no one would have had to repeat the words 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.610
 symbols carry ideas and allow teenagers to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.790
 commit 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.320
 virtual monsters 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.390
 it's something that bothers me is half acceptable as to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 semantics makes polemic some prefer without minimizing 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.030
 you are absolutely right sir who is besides me I asked that by 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.050
 extension 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.620
 entry 6 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.500
 stash 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.070
 to remove from all the libraries of the UN we had to reduce the risk 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.979
 the organizers of the quai du polar festival when they want to be reassuring 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.580
 salehi swimmers can register there is no question of simulating 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.970
 killings five on the game very useful for with ol this climate of fear of that 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.510
 the trade of tomorrow on the ground 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.420
 finally remember that the festival quays of the polar is above all meetings 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.060
 with authors from around the world 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.709
