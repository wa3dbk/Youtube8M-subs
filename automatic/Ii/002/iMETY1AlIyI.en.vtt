stitch and this is where you would

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.460 
stitch and this is where you would
normally<00:01:13.670> slide<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.270> stitch<00:01:15.630> off<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.259> you

normally slide the stitch off and you
would<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.799> finished<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.060> since<00:01:18.329> we<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
would be finished but since we want to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.719 
would be finished but since we want to
make<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.409> stitch<00:01:20.479> you're<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.729> use

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
make one more stitch you're going to use

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.840 
make one more stitch you're going to use
the<00:01:23.970> needle<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.570> knit<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> other<00:01:26.040> side<00:01:26.610> of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the needle and knit on the other side of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.380 
the needle and knit on the other side of
the<00:01:27.000> stitch<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:28.049> through<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:29.390> like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the stitch going through the back like

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
the stitch going through the back like
that<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.070> pull<00:01:35.399> that<00:01:35.579> through

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that and pull that through

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.899 
that and pull that through
so<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:37.020> stitches<00:01:37.790> coming<00:01:38.790> out

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
so now you have two stitches coming out

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
so now you have two stitches coming out
of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.450> stitch<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.649> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:41.009> slide

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of the one stitch and then you can slide

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.850 
of the one stitch and then you can slide
it<00:01:41.490> off<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.670> where<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it off so you can see where it kind of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
it off so you can see where it kind of
makes<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.219> little<00:01:47.369> bump<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.479> your

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
makes a little bump right there for your

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.520 
makes a little bump right there for your
next<00:01:48.840> stitch

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
next stitch

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.370 
next stitch
but<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.950> won't<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.310> matter<00:01:51.170> let's<00:01:52.170> do

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
but that won't really matter let's do

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.399 
but that won't really matter let's do
this<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:52.860> time

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
this one more time

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:05.610
