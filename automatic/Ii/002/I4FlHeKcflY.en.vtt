00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.400
 we continue in this section to see your 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.960
 great rivalries in drink with a 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.169
 Italian classic a superclassic 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.379
 Italian vermouth roses insane versus 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.840
 martín and martín and insane verses something 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.370
 that has a lot of history in Italy but 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.860
 behind immigration in Argentina 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:26.380
 about 150 years of the history of a 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.800
 beloved category in Argentina from 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.890
 much sale that in each house there is a 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.550
 Vermouth is taken that always takes our 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 grandparents our great grandparents is something 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 delicious 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.249
 and more 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.970
 martín and martín and various insane two 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.730
 very famous Italian houses that in the 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.649
 world are from two business groups 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.520
 different with obviously roots 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.110
 Italians without healthy from the campari group 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.930
 martín and the bacardi martini group that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.000
 they both have in argentina 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.530
 different instructors prisoners 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.960
 they had the same for decades 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.960
 distributor Argentine stocks elaborating 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.640
 it locally but in the world 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 great competitors a great reality 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.970
 a superclassic is a superclassic is the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.660
 vecchia signora is the one I helped against 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:35.500
 milan or because because one is typically 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.770
 the tour and deza version of the vermouth the other 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.009
 is the Milanese version, but as 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.350
 later we will see the botanists can 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.330
 vary by area and the base wine goes to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 vary a bit by area 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.179
 basically both are the same idea and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 the French blue of southern France 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:00.270
 where italy has had great influence 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 they also adopted this variable of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.100
 improve your wines in a snack what 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 you say 30 or 40 years ago that Saturday 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.280
 the morning our parents myself 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.080
 when I was 19 20 years old in the neighborhood that 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.530
 you would live on Saturday morning type a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.959
 the 11th was the verb with little plates 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.390
 what happened to those weird things like that 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.430
 without healthy it became synonymous with 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.580
 sleep of you asked his insane though 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.160
 you will take others 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.590
 and then that tradition went 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.600
 losing but these drinks are 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.660
 wonderful in the use of the build 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.080
 international and sebastián there are several 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.690
 types of vermouth is white the extra 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.720
 drive but red is like the original 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.620
 if you are just thinking that well 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.409
 said Roberto 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.659
 an appetizer is the ideal word for 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.760
 open your appetite like to use it before 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.379
 to eat because a recreation mixes 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.690
 everything is mixed in the nobility wine is 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.230
 a 75% wine legally has to be 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.879
 wine with fortified distilled alcohol or 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.920
 the culture of pieres is mixed 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.840
 the culture of the de facto terms that 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040
 It's the sight of a wine recreation 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.530
 most contiguous of the wine world 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.930
 Hippocratic that is completed to cure 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.489
 it flavored that wine not only 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.040
 because it had herbal properties that 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.720
 they have them but it also helped them 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.640
 to make healthier wine itself 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.160
 because it lasted longer as Roberto said 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.769
 wine improved but then French with 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.079
 his refinement took him up 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.220
 but doing something totally destined 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.349
 that we can not do it for the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.540
 haute cuisine and luckily today I 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.540
 I think that as you spoke, it was lost in 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.430
 the almost 70 80 or 90 costs totally 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.530
 11 recovered only enter a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.810
 supermarket gondola 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.760
 how important that category is to 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.590
 Argentina is as if one visits 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.200
 any family has it and above all 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.560
 in the idea of ​​this versus there will be a 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.830
 winner 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.050
 I think I think now going 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.810
 specifically to brands without healthy 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.210
 verses martín in the liquid in the tasting 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.130
 I see them very similar 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.620
 but let's talk specifically about the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.170
 brand positioning because being 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.950
 in the same hands for decades the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.080
 same producer still being from groups 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.670
 different Italians have had a 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.590
 positioning one on top of the other 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.340
 one more popular the other more elitist 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:30.120
 insane maybe more popular indeed 640 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.240
 thousand boxes were sold in 2010 that is 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.450
 600 accounts thousand boxes of 12 bottles with 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.450
 martini at a price above in some 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.190
 92 thousand boxes maybe Martin and working 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.070
 now as something more elegant is insane 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.190
 with something more popular but as something more 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.960
 of football not with this of if they are saved 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.170
 These commercials by Alberto Olmedo 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.340
 the 60s 70 and martín is something more 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.440
 more distinguished d 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.710
 as with something more glamor night 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.120
 that they go and now you see in a competition 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.190
 very very important 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.460
 it comes to the verses of truth comes the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.560
 rivalry in the mouth beyond this of the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.810
 Mark in the mouth as we see it seems things 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.300
 I have is not exactly how to treat 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.380
 a vermouth in is Felix when we take out a 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.630
 vote on wish we did the most 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.610
 balanced the one that closes in 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.229
 its edges that have no edges and that 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.030
 It lasts longer and it does not leave a bad taste 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.110
 that I do not burn the game like your 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.960
 mobile concepts 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.610
 roberto hs in wine is more balanced in 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.650
 of the tannin of acidity but for me in 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.510
 this the fundamental to understand which 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.919
 is better gene better elaborated is that not 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.940
 have the one that has the most noble taste 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.300
 more noble flavors of herbs 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.040
 spices and that does not have something better 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.650
 chemicals or plastics that I in any of 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.740
 I'm sorry I'm sorry a little more I 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.570
 I already have my my winner, but also 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.940
 the third one pound that happens with 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.270
 French gets like a third in 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.830
 discord is close to the Italians 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.139
 as you see it, you are not forgetting 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.289
 that for many years in the south of 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.309
 France 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:04.580
 part of the Swiss parts up 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:07.879
 milan or train and 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.889
 it was a duchy they are related 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.060
 familiarly does not call me at all the 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.909
 attention is not that the French 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.960
 they broke into the Italian business but 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:20.810
 I think they joined a tradition 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.000
 of the area in the dukedom that they formed 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.470
 part of for more than 150 years 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.509
 maybe it would be a bit of trial and 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.460
 compare pounds with martini chisels and 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.660
 not because the brands have their 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.759
 practice of postín the same castle 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.229
 upwards alike but this case does not 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.169
 is licensed or is only done 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.460
 in Marseille in the south of France with a 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.590
 very particular technique that would be very 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.870
 difficult to adapt because it depends a lot 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.090
 of climate they age in barrel in 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.949
 barrels but the weather or use 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.130
 the climate beyond for that climate 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.810
 grant him impregnate that characteristic 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.820
 of the heat or cold especially cold or 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.590
 fresh and therefore of the minerals of the 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.360
 Factories take good care of the wine is not the 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.190
 case of how Robert said that each 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.259
 Martinelli's license is that 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.669
 use the wine you have on hand in the 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.979
 that is not careless but it is another wine 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.470
 well different I think we see it in the 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.389
 tasting here is much more tasty has a 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.009
 very particular aroma that if that 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.389
 they treat a wheat cocktail in hebron and it's 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.460
 that has a third of the vermouth that 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.570
 used in this case contempt and goes to 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.340
 be more tasty surely the 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.199
 control yourself valls and it's going to be another 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.940
 technology construction then wants 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.770
 say that wool does not prat nor prat but 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.210
 in reality as we say the guest 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.840
 no pound is in rivalry let me 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.560
 tell 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.169
 and I stay with science 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.590
 I totally agree he marginalized 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:34.710
 the 10 most elaborated the one that arrived at the 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.900
 Olympus of this category the prat for that 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.020
 Beware of that special thing that 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:43.050
 French doubt others are without healthy is 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.700
 without any doubt or synonym of relationship 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.590
 they will presume neither to speak nor of the day of peanut 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.570
 speak to close opinion exactly 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.639
 as my friends of experts 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.350
 sebastián and roberto as not free no 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.940
 Argentina arrive I could not choose 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.520
 but it shows that it was with the heat 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.940
 over but between sanea martin in 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.940
 this rivalry
