 hint need to do so that all 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.549
 the squares have disappeared but there is one trick 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.350
 so that I would be with us 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.900
 the squares disappear at least to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.409
 there were two together then they disappear then 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.810
 there is a motive than the meaning let's say I click 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 here is green see green yes red 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 red yes that is, if more than two 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.250
 then they will be able to collapse 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.649
 one then we all lose but we have this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 the race was decided which one is simple and now 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.570
 we all decided here throughout 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.299
 games with us will communicate a pirate who 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.860

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.310
 let's see what it is 2 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 goal breaking 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.319
 the first 2 they are simple enough its them 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.740
 sorry i clicked again and the first one 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.660
 restart and we start playing 2 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.200
 puzzles 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.750
 so and then it will be paul very difficult 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.330
 and get caught so you are very hard 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 will be because I, too, in the course I threw 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.620
 for half the game because me she 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.630
 it was very hard now 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890
 second race what we need to do we 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.590
 push? 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.980
 we need to do so on the board 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.790
 there was only one skull 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 something needs to be done to 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.790
 the skulls of the hall we drown on which 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.310
 skull yes here and so svaypom and we 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.590
 another skull disappears and it is necessary that 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.840
 the board has only one skull left 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.819
 remain 2 we lose but we are now 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.319
 so loudly I passed it very 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.700
 quickly pass all I went through here now 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.550
 you will be the third column to give 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.579
 last yes I have not played it try 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.230
 so to speak in one gulp 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.870
 I get it because the first two 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.209
 race I thought to what and how to do in 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.680
 let's see what we need to do here and tap 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.690
 begin to take a look at it 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.750
 can mister do it 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.829
 so we have four buttons here like me 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.829
 I understand on the bare 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.020
 all four buttons at the same time 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.420
 Key board you have clear yeah well it is necessary to 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.350
 that all six buttons were pressed 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:50.940
 add a sequence of these buttons so 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:57.500
 that is, the first attack, but I thought I called 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.010
 I will also go through everything I have passed and we pass 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 this puzzle 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.800
 after passing give us sound 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.930
 put a seal on it loud and 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:13.470
 a sign that we have passed this column 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.060
 here is all the print of the post let's 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.570
 look at all 4 chapters nku 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.120
 I myself am wondering what food will be there 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.060
 we will be interested in you too 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.150
 approximate and submission that had 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.220
 if the game represents some 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.580
 memory combine remember where 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.580
 I haven't got it yet 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:46.990
 Yeah, I remember the press and it is necessary to understand 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.680
 put it is necessary to remember where you were 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.370
 four of these points and after that us 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.010
 need to guess shorter need to have memory 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.919
 to remember that is when started not 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.100
 let's try to understand there must again 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.830
 visual memory he is good to have 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.510
 you got to live in the race pancake here 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.510
 the dough for me is a hard puzzle 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:20.890
 hellishly heavy 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:23.610
 and this is somewhere here was likely 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.580
 wrong not 9 not about ours there in the circle 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.410
 there were these little chests, well, so I went 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.600
 You need to want them to touch perfectly 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.450
 well thank god that's such a race 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.919
 like to buy it worth it 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.590
 only 35 rubles seems to me for 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.270
