00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
low e to the a so you have v in the base

low e to the a so you have v in the base
you've<00:01:46.229> got<00:01:46.260> that<00:01:46.590> instead<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.460> two<00:01:47.760> three

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
four tight by one time so you go now

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.980

into<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.860> B<00:02:05.420> changes<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> little<00:02:06.750> bit<00:02:06.869> now

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
into the B changes a little bit now

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.600 
into the B changes a little bit now
because<00:02:07.200> you're<00:02:07.320> using<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.650> F<00:02:07.770> sharp<00:02:07.800> as<00:02:08.310> the

the beat because we would be here

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:28.430 
the beat because we would be here
they<00:02:15.030> knew<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.300> F<00:02:15.630> sharp<00:02:15.660> too

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.380 

now<00:02:29.130> one<00:02:29.310> thing<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.490> every<00:02:29.760> clapton<00:02:30.150> uses

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
now one thing that every clapton uses

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720 
now one thing that every clapton uses
which<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.690> not<00:02:30.840> evidence<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> book<00:02:32.460> he

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
which is not evidence and in the book he

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
which is not evidence and in the book he
uses<00:02:33.210> pressure<00:02:33.480> releases<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.230> these<00:02:34.350> things

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
uses pressure releases so these things
