up my workspace down in the basement
which<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.330> where<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:09.960> airbrushing

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
which is where I do all my airbrushing

which is where I do all my airbrushing
and<00:00:10.679> painting<00:00:11.360> I<00:00:12.360> thought<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.380> know<00:00:13.500> seeing

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
and painting I thought you know seeing

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.259 
and painting I thought you know seeing
as<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> couple<00:00:14.370> people<00:00:14.639> actually<00:00:14.759> asked<00:00:15.059> me

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
as a couple people actually asked me

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.740 
as a couple people actually asked me
about<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:16.910> show<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.300> paint

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
about this I just show you my paint

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.980 
about this I just show you my paint
booth<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:20.220> people<00:00:20.460> might<00:00:20.609> call<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
booth as some people might call it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
booth as some people might call it
there's<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> lot<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.320> paint<00:00:22.980> booths<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.490> there

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
there's a lot of paint booths out there

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.210 
there's a lot of paint booths out there
that<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.029> actually<00:00:24.180> buy<00:00:24.539> from<00:00:24.840> stores

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
that you can actually buy from stores

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.279 
that you can actually buy from stores
but<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.490> pretty<00:00:26.670> expensive<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:28.109> my

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
but they are pretty expensive and in my

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.740 
but they are pretty expensive and in my
opinion<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.859> all<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.460> them<00:00:29.609> are<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:29.970> very

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
opinion not all of them are really very

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.860 
opinion not all of them are really very
good<00:00:30.929> before<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.710> built<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.430> myself<00:00:32.870> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
good before I built this one myself I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.260 
good before I built this one myself I
had<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.890> bought<00:00:35.160> at<00:00:35.430> an<00:00:35.610> online<00:00:35.940> store

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
had one that I bought at an online store

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
had one that I bought at an online store
for<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.500> hundred<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.890> fifty<00:00:38.160> euros

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
for I think a hundred and fifty euros

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.750 
for I think a hundred and fifty euros
and<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.510> those<00:00:39.780> um<00:00:40.520> spray<00:00:41.520> booths

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and it was one of those um spray booths

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.190 
and it was one of those um spray booths
that<00:00:42.090> had<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:43.610> mesh<00:00:44.610> filter<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.840> front<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that had this mesh filter in front of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100 
that had this mesh filter in front of
the<00:00:46.320> actual<00:00:46.739> fan<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:48.120> didn't<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.690> suck

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the actual fan and it didn't really suck

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.830 
the actual fan and it didn't really suck
in<00:00:49.350> most<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> fumes<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> decided

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
in most of the fumes so what I decided

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860 
in most of the fumes so what I decided
to<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.579> lot<00:00:53.879> less<00:00:54.090> money<00:00:54.300> build<00:00:54.690> my

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to do was for a lot less money build my

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
to do was for a lot less money build my
own<00:00:54.899> without<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.489> filter<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.329> front<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
own without a filter in front of the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.830 
own without a filter in front of the
ventilator<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.969> has<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.539> turned

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
ventilator and that has actually turned

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.369 
ventilator and that has actually turned
out<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.320> very<00:01:01.670> effective<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.539> first<00:01:04.199> off

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
out to be very effective so first off

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.899 
out to be very effective so first off
I'll<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:05.189> over<00:01:05.309> how<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.670> actually

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I'll just go over how this actually

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 
I'll just go over how this actually
works<00:01:06.090> first<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> need<00:01:07.590> some

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
works first you're going to need some

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.800 
works first you're going to need some
kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> box<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.810> performance

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
kind of a box so that the performance

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
kind of a box so that the performance
the<00:01:13.350> sucking<00:01:13.680> performance<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the sucking performance of the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.870 
the sucking performance of the
ventilator<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.860> channeled<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.610> all<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
ventilator can be channeled and all the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.090 
ventilator can be channeled and all the
fumes<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.259> spraying<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.830> first

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
fumes that you're spraying will first

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
fumes that you're spraying will first
stay<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.090> area<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:22.799> going

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
stay in this area and then you're going

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120 
stay in this area and then you're going
to<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.700> hose<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.799> divert<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to need some kind of hose to divert the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
to need some kind of hose to divert the
fumes<00:01:27.619> out<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> window<00:01:29.090> ideally<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.500> that's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
fumes out of a window ideally and that's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
fumes out of a window ideally and that's
basically<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.900> fabric

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
basically what I do I have this fabric

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
basically what I do I have this fabric
hose<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.829> hang<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.490> window

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
hose that I just hang out the window

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.609 
hose that I just hang out the window
like<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.860> turn<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
like so and then I can turn on the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.200 
like so and then I can turn on the
ventilator

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
ventilator

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
ventilator
as<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.960> actually<00:01:43.380> quite<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> bunch<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
as you has actually quite a bunch of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.359 
as you has actually quite a bunch of
stuff<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:47.130> does<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
stuff in there right now and it does a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
stuff in there right now and it does a
pretty<00:01:47.460> good<00:01:47.700> job<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.299> sucking<00:01:48.510> in<00:01:48.780> fumes<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
pretty good job at sucking in fumes and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.300 
pretty good job at sucking in fumes and
then<00:01:49.470> blowing<00:01:49.830> them<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.190> window<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
then blowing them out the window so a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.460 
then blowing them out the window so a
couple<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.400> tips<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.850> could<00:01:53.909> give<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.470> when

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
couple of tips I could give you when

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530 
couple of tips I could give you when
choosing<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.979> box<00:01:56.190> go<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.909> plastic<00:01:57.360> box

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
choosing the box go with a plastic box

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.930 
choosing the box go with a plastic box
that's<00:01:57.869> clear<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.650> that<00:01:58.800> if<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.729> you

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
that's clear so that if you have you

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.680 
that's clear so that if you have you
know<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.060> lamp<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.770> actually

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
know a lamp like this you can actually

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.240 
know a lamp like this you can actually
shine<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.840> light<00:02:03.990> through<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> box<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
shine the light through the box so that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.430 
shine the light through the box so that
this<00:02:05.790> whole<00:02:06.030> area<00:02:06.060> isn't<00:02:06.630> too<00:02:06.869> dark<00:02:07.140> while

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
this whole area isn't too dark while

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.180 
this whole area isn't too dark while
you're<00:02:07.590> spraying<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:09.770> one<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.100> you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you're spraying in it one thing that you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.059 
you're spraying in it one thing that you
might<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> note<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.800> won't<00:02:13.800> let<00:02:13.920> me

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
might want to note is I won't let me

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.729 
might want to note is I won't let me
turn<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.370> off<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.600> drilled<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.290> hole<00:02:16.320> in

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
turn this off I just drilled a hole in

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.770 
turn this off I just drilled a hole in
this<00:02:16.950> box<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.580> place<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.360> fan<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
this box and place the fan on the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.360 
this box and place the fan on the
left-hand<00:02:19.350> side<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.860> that's<00:02:20.070> because

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
left-hand side and that's because

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.310 
left-hand side and that's because
obviously<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:21.209> right-handed

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
obviously I'm right-handed

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.930 
obviously I'm right-handed
so<00:02:22.530> when<00:02:22.800> I'm<00:02:22.920> spraying<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.430> an<00:02:23.610> airbrush

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
so when I'm spraying with an airbrush

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
so when I'm spraying with an airbrush
over<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.690> usually<00:02:25.350> point<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.739> airbrush

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
over here I usually point the airbrush

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.190 
over here I usually point the airbrush
in<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.580> direction<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.900> part<00:02:28.110> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
in this direction and the part is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.930 
in this direction and the part is
somewhere<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.860> then<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> fumes<00:02:29.790> from

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
somewhere here and then the fumes from

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.550 
somewhere here and then the fumes from
the<00:02:30.060> airbrush<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.660> missed<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> part<00:02:31.260> will

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the airbrush that missed the part will

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.600 
the airbrush that missed the part will
go<00:02:32.280> into<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.760> fan<00:02:32.940> directly<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.400> if<00:02:35.400> you're<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
go into the fan directly and if you're a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.110 
go into the fan directly and if you're a
left-handed<00:02:36.030> person<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.420> guess<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.780> could<00:02:38.120> put

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
left-handed person I guess you could put

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.150 
left-handed person I guess you could put
the<00:02:39.300> fan<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.170> right<00:02:40.500> hand<00:02:40.739> side<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.540> this

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
the fan on the right hand side so this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.880 
the fan on the right hand side so this
is<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.580> an<00:02:44.790> ordinary<00:02:45.120> bathroom<00:02:46.050> ventilation

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
is just an ordinary bathroom ventilation

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.699 
is just an ordinary bathroom ventilation
fan<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.600> take<00:02:48.780> note<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.079> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
fan but you have to take note of the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.020 
fan but you have to take note of the
fans<00:02:49.950> performance<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.760> you're<00:02:50.820> going<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
fans performance that you're going to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.530 
fans performance that you're going to
use<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.900> used<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.829> fan<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.340> has<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.940> suction

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
use I used a fan that has a suction

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.800 
use I used a fan that has a suction
power<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.910> 175<00:02:56.910> cubic<00:02:57.450> meters<00:02:57.780> per

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
power of I think 175 cubic meters per

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.650 
power of I think 175 cubic meters per
hour<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:59.280> plenty<00:02:59.820> enough<00:03:00.060> for

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
hour and that is plenty enough for

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.009 
hour and that is plenty enough for
airbrushing<00:03:01.170> not<00:03:01.739> necessarily<00:03:02.370> for

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
airbrushing not necessarily for

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.509 
airbrushing not necessarily for
spray-painting<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.829> should<00:03:04.980> always<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.340> that

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
spray-painting you should always do that

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.610 
spray-painting you should always do that
outside<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.660> definitely<00:03:07.079> enough<00:03:07.350> for

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
outside but it's definitely enough for

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.610 
outside but it's definitely enough for
airbrushing<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.660> again<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.200> just<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
airbrushing and again this is just a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.800 
airbrushing and again this is just a
plastic<00:03:11.010> PE<00:03:11.400> box<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.090> would<00:03:12.209> normally

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
plastic PE box that you would normally

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.229 
plastic PE box that you would normally
use<00:03:12.840> for<00:03:12.959> laundry<00:03:13.620> stuff<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:15.090> at

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
use for laundry stuff like that and at

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.630 
use for laundry stuff like that and at
the<00:03:15.360> back<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.829> can<00:03:16.890> see<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.190> drilled

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the back here you can see I just drilled

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.810 
the back here you can see I just drilled
a<00:03:17.790> hole<00:03:17.820> here<00:03:18.630> into<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.110> PE<00:03:19.320> box<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.920> attach

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
a hole here into this PE box and attach

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.289 
a hole here into this PE box and attach
the<00:03:21.120> fan<00:03:21.630> with<00:03:21.930> screws<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.730> at<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> back<00:03:24.030> here

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
the fan with screws and at the back here

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.660 
the fan with screws and at the back here
we've<00:03:24.450> got<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.900> fabric<00:03:25.620> tube<00:03:25.859> which<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.280> very

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
we've got this fabric tube which is very

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.190 
we've got this fabric tube which is very
neat<00:03:27.450> comes<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.320> handy<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.519> attach<00:03:29.880> that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
neat comes in handy and I attach that

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.630 
neat comes in handy and I attach that
fabric<00:03:31.200> tube<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.130> back<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.489> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
fabric tube to the back of the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.949 
fabric tube to the back of the
ventilator<00:03:33.150> with<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.400> ring<00:03:35.400> clamp<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.720> call

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
ventilator with a ring clamp as you call

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.009 
ventilator with a ring clamp as you call
it<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.200> think<00:03:37.440> this<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.450> circular<00:03:39.450> clamp

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
it I think this is just a circular clamp

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.840 
it I think this is just a circular clamp
that<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.549> tighten<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.269> screwdriver<00:03:42.359> and

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
that you tighten with a screwdriver and

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.490 
that you tighten with a screwdriver and
that's<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:45.180> how<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.359> fastened<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.170> pipe

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
that's just how you fastened that pipe

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.820 
that's just how you fastened that pipe
to<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.040> end<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.760> ventilator

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
to the end of the ventilator

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.570 
to the end of the ventilator
and<00:03:48.920> that'll<00:03:49.700> ensure<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.360> pipe<00:03:50.840> doesn't

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
and that'll ensure that the pipe doesn't

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.140 
and that'll ensure that the pipe doesn't
accidentally<00:03:52.580> detach<00:03:53.000> from<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.360> fan<00:03:53.920> so

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
accidentally detach from the fan so

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.010 
accidentally detach from the fan so
that's<00:03:56.150> pretty<00:03:56.330> much<00:03:56.390> all<00:03:56.660> you're<00:03:56.840> going<00:03:56.960> to

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
that's pretty much all you're going to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.810 
that's pretty much all you're going to
need<00:03:57.230> you're<00:03:57.500> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.740> need<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:58.160> some<00:03:58.610> kind<00:03:58.730> of

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
need you're going to need a some kind of

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.090 
need you're going to need a some kind of
a<00:03:58.910> box<00:03:59.090> preferably<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.170> clear<00:04:00.500> plastic<00:04:00.740> one

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
a box preferably a clear plastic one

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.890 
a box preferably a clear plastic one
like<00:04:01.370> mine<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:02.860> ventilator<00:04:03.860> with<00:04:04.400> enough<00:04:05.240> power

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
like mine a ventilator with enough power

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.890 
like mine a ventilator with enough power
suction<00:04:06.800> power<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:09.400> fabric<00:04:10.400> tube<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.970> then<00:04:11.720> of

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
suction power a fabric tube and then of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.940 
suction power a fabric tube and then of
course<00:04:11.930> some<00:04:12.440> kind<00:04:12.710> of<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:13.160> ring<00:04:13.580> clamp<00:04:13.880> and

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
course some kind of a ring clamp and

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.000 
course some kind of a ring clamp and
ideally<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.340> should<00:04:16.519> be<00:04:16.640> able<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:17.739> hang<00:04:18.739> this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
ideally you should be able to hang this

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.550 
ideally you should be able to hang this
pipe<00:04:19.280> out<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.640> a<00:04:19.670> window<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.390> that's<00:04:21.380> pretty

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
pipe out of a window and that's pretty

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.890 
pipe out of a window and that's pretty
much<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.070> think<00:04:22.340> all<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.610> all<00:04:22.750> because<00:04:23.750> I

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
much it I think all in all because I

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.830 
much it I think all in all because I
took<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.230> pretty<00:04:24.680> powerful<00:04:24.920> fan<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.840> spent

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
took a pretty powerful fan I spent

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.400 
took a pretty powerful fan I spent
around<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:28.010> think<00:04:28.340> 75<00:04:28.820> euros<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.840> fat<00:04:30.080> alone

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
around of I think 75 euros the fat alone

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.430 
around of I think 75 euros the fat alone
I<00:04:30.590> think<00:04:30.800> cost<00:04:31.480> 65<00:04:32.480> euros<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.110> all<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.320> other

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
I think cost 65 euros and all the other

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.430 
I think cost 65 euros and all the other
parts<00:04:34.150> okay<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:35.210> maybe<00:04:35.510> they<00:04:35.720> were<00:04:35.780> like<00:04:36.020> 15

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
parts okay so maybe they were like 15

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.980 
parts okay so maybe they were like 15
euros<00:04:36.740> but<00:04:37.280> it's<00:04:37.550> really<00:04:37.820> inexpensive<00:04:38.390> and

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
euros but it's really inexpensive and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.970
