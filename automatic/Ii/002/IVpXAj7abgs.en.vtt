00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 regarding 2 recently on the channel we are like 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.460
 I recently do this block when everyone 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700
 bombed and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.129
 September 2 , but right in the evening, that's why 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.020
 now I see after a while 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.770
 this video will not be on the channel 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.690
 and yet I found one interesting 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 person with music education 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.650
 which is also done absolutely 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.350
 free for me as for me for you 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 analyzes on the electric guitar and the man's name is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 Dima and here he recently started a video on 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.490
 channel we either published a review on 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.470
 a band of brace called o'bryan 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.299
 died 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 Well, you took him not very well in 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.350
 In principle, this is understandable because man 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.820
 new i haven't voiced it in any blog 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.070
 that he will be there to take part in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.600
 channel development and when you end up 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.299
 see my screensaver see absolutely 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.329
 left man roughly it of course 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.520
 confuses thats all the same I want you 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.100
 reacted 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.490
 to this video, which has already been deleted 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 there 's nothing you can not take 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.390
 to the next video that will be released 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.070
 if she comes out he will disassemble already 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 probably some acoustic guitar 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.549
 the song 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 treated this video more 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.409
 loyal that is, if it is bad yes you can 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.920
 calmly disliking 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.110
 but if the video is something bad but also 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.340
 something good 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.629
 write about it next time 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.590
 video comments 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.370
 Well tell everyone to errors and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.319
 Comments consist of two words such as 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.450
 model 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.190
 this is no ordinary comment like 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.680
 student I hope my audience 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.299
 butt and composed and as you know 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.220
 students from the state of mind and they 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.190
 mean that if you teach school you 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.299
 necessarily straight school student 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 state of mind here I like too 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.579
 Sometimes there are students here are all the moolah 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.100
 ha ha ha no dragged guys guys can 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.470
 so here is the following need something 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.850
 tell video lessons how do you know 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.660
 go out often up to them in almost every 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.970
 video now there is advertising think but 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.650
 most on my most monitor 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.690
 I think most of the audience we know 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.840
 why is there advertising because 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.579
 how would a free lessons 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.709
 accordingly at least some advertising 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.170
 I will make a profit if youtube 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.940
 now roughly speaking do not pay for 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.500
 seeing that is advertising which is seen in 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.000
 the beginning how are you there 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.519
 skip in five seconds 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.650
 What screensaver here is advertising not now 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.790
 do not bring at all I would like to you 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.799
 show youtube income but no 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.750
 because a million earn such 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.819
 Rich here I sit here the camera is shorter 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.660
 worth it on a super tripod give you show 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.740
 your super tripod at work is soup 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.380
 tripod is a glass 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.600
 now so that the logo could not see it 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.460
 super tripod is shorter than a glass here 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.590
 shorter than some boxes with on the discs 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.940
 mega super tripod yes and so man 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.180
 earned millions can imagine 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.660
 let such a tripod know or here 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.700
 so ads have every video 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.430
 advertising is useful I do not take advertising 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.950
 totally useless then there are some 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.050
 I know some paid courses that are not 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.360
 what they donâ€™t bring here if i 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.690
 advertising some content means he 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.459
 it is useful to wear it already looked if it 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.230
 some man who has his 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.530
 a certain course this course took 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.450
 took a copy from him and watched that is 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.280
 corrected useful but the shop world of strings 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.800
 you know this is my official 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.730
 the sponsor that is his advertisement will often 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.170
 and I also advise you to go look 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.380
 I advise you to buy strings there and now 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.900
 it's not advertising anymore 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.440
 just because a good store and 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.060
 shop owners my good friend 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.080
 videos will continue to go out in such 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.370
 the same amount of links you can and yes 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.780
 by the way one more thing 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.150
 have one guy guy just take 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.190
 absolutely left man who writes in 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.100
 lichku me lichku parsing songs 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.110
 How do you know if I throw in a personal 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.700
 please sort the song I have a message not 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.510
 I think I think many with this 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.320
 faced 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.890
 if the comments are essentially that is he 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.110
 not composed 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.300
 know how easy it is to calculate a comment 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.030
 there is something message like main 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.160
 this plan, pony zombies audio recording is 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.500
 That means it is anyway an application for 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.080
 analysis they are just and watch the bands 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.530
 the guy to listen to good music is all 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.230
 I do not read requests for analysis in a personal 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.730
 you can keep them on my site there 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.700
