 the famous daddy's pig and it's called 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 skating on the ice 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.290

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.660
 ice 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660
 and well, let's play 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.980
 I do not need to give us a number in this 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.860
 case those of number 4 and we have 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.790
 to see the three options that gave us 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.360
 and tell us here take a few steps 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.660
 They looked like lemonade and some glasses 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.960
 how are we going to think it's milk with 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:11.920
 chocolate and let's count them here there is 1 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:16.229
 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 this is not number 4 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.740
 here are some green apples 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.780
 neither is number 4 almost almost and here 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.300
 There are what appear to be a tacit 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.979
 with jelly to see 1 2 3 and 4 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.400
 they are definitely and we are going to 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.690
 click 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.660
 easily laughs and pp georg draws us 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.330
 in number 4 that ice and also it 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.770
 Laughs love to skate on the ice 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.420
 very well 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.649
 now this gives us another opportunity this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:58.259
 time the number 11 count the 1 is super 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:02.079
 super easy we have to catch it then the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.869
 circle that has only one object here 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.530
 we see that we have many so it is not 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.739
 this and here we also have many 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.879
 chocolate chip cookies 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.330
 so how are cookies with 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.970
 chocolate sparks or oranges 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.120
 then we only have the option of 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.660
 this gelatin cup that is one 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:33.020
 and this is the pepa draws us the number 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.410
 one together with George and he laughs 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.750
 now 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.480
 very well 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.630
 to move from the have other numbers 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.819
 in this case in number three and we're going to 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.459
 tell 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.639
 the correct option would be this where 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.980
 There are the three jelly cups but 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:57.579
 we 're going to make a mistake this time we're going 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.469
 to do wrong ok let's click on this 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.129
 that obviously has many more than 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.510
 three have many ice cream popsicles and 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.459
 the mother of this option to see what 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.920
 happens to see what happens with pepe with 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.959
 georg 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.550
 or pp georges dry the valley not this not what 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.720
 we're going to do it again because we do not have 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.950
 the pp and george get hurt so we go 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.970
 to hit the correct number this time 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.970
 to go from tones of number 6 and we're going 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.520
 to tell this is a single orange like that 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.520
 that this option is not and here we have 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.440
 123456789 jelly cups so I do not 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.360
 neither is this option so we have left 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.000
 count the meringues with lemonade 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.280
 to see one two three four five or six 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.190
 this is the correct option 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.920
 we give you click here let's serve this 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.790
