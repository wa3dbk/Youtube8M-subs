that<00:00:37.110> i<00:00:37.140> made<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.890> four<00:00:38.040> horas<00:00:38.430> instead<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that i made just four horas instead of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.810 
that i made just four horas instead of
my<00:00:39.420> GBA<00:00:39.840> sceptile<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.710> maybe<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> comes<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
my GBA sceptile so maybe that comes to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.950 
my GBA sceptile so maybe that comes to
play<00:00:41.940> maybe<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:42.360> doesn't<00:00:42.510> were<00:00:42.660> gonna<00:00:42.809> find

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
play maybe he doesn't were gonna find

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
play maybe he doesn't were gonna find
out<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.590> he<00:00:43.680> does<00:00:43.829> lead<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.399> his

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
out here but he does lead out with his

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
out here but he does lead out with his
entei<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> lead<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.020> my<00:00:46.110> mean<00:00:46.320> shot<00:00:46.530> go

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
entei and as I lead up my mean shot go

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
entei and as I lead up my mean shot go
for<00:00:46.829> stone<00:00:47.039> edge<00:00:47.219> over<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> u-turn<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
for stone edge over the u-turn because I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
for stone edge over the u-turn because I
figured<00:00:48.480> maybe<00:00:49.110> he<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.469> may<00:00:49.800> expect<00:00:50.100> me<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
figured maybe he just may expect me to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
figured maybe he just may expect me to
be<00:00:50.430> scarf<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> may<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.840> want<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> take<00:00:52.199> me
