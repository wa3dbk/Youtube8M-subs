00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.260
 do nothing at all clown collects 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.989
 children kill them all things is a subject 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.610
 interpretations which interpretation gives 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.049
 time function of life and strength and looking for something 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.459
 possibility some kind of philosophical quotes 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.950
 it is possible to play much deeper than 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.810

 okay let's go get me 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.739
 I remind you that most of the games for takeaway 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.560
 you offer yourself therefore 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.690
 offers from offices 3 do not know with us 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.650

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.670

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.790

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.370
 don't have any sub-network patents with 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.370
 things that are beautiful should be 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.110
 understood if you need to add something 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.040
 british and somebody else can 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.590
 the creator then basically judging by 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:12.470
 music yes most likely this game puts pressure on 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:16.430
 philosophy puts pressure on the psyche before it went 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.260
 the canvas I already have words even psychology on 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.570
 psyche she crushes your mother they 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.970

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.340
 james earl coke space 3 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.320
 james michael kors apparently under 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.020
 by coke they did this game exactly and in 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.389
 real talking mushroom for a clown of some kind 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.919

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.990
 vivaldi you well or die 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.990
 and this is probably some kind of thread music from here 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.610
 specifically for this game to write music 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.710
 a couple is utter nonsense but such a game I 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.220
 Che did not know it for the withdrawal of such a question 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.470
 on real 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.510
 so that the psyche you blow up a little people 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.169
 relaxed us a little brains then 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.990
