 It is difficult to understand at all in the movie but something 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.940

 I do not know a little Nde has written taking large 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.030
 It's really hard to understand in videos, but it's moving in a subtle way 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.940
 In even though I have a button it I hope is next to it which is it is eco mode earlier 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.490
 Eco mode but it was put out 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.700

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.340
 The back is like this 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.500
 Is this something an exhaust port? 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.920
 It is attached with such a feeling 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.150

 That's right 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.220
 It is something that has a lot of strokes Kaneko's 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.210
 This stroke of overall listening is quite a lot 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.230
 Sound when struck in is also directly below but out also strange in such a feeling 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.230
 It is like this 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.500
 It sounds like it sounds pretty good , so it's in Topre, but a guy like this one was sold 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.590
 It also seems different from that 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.069
 The manufacturer is a bit unknown 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.450

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.240
 Crunchy 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.250
 I think it is a good keyboard 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.720
 Yes Next is the introduction of the main body, but before that, look at the specs 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.110
