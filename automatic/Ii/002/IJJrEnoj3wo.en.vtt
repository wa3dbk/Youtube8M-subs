00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
about three years so I just put a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.109 
about three years so I just put a
battery<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.689> we'll<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.560> fires<00:00:22.740> up

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:37.549 

hopefully<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:35.870> two<00:00:36.870> hundred<00:00:37.170> nineteen

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
hopefully it will two hundred nineteen

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:58.479 
hopefully it will two hundred nineteen
thousand<00:00:38.040> miles<00:00:48.890> that's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> bad<00:00:50.340> runner

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.869

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
for sitting as long as it has but the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.730 
for sitting as long as it has but the
transmission<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:06.600> making<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.260> kind<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
transmission is is making a kind of a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.340 
transmission is is making a kind of a
grinding<00:01:08.130> noise<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.610> why<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> was<00:01:08.970> parked

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
grinding noise that's why I was parked

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.060 
grinding noise that's why I was parked
and<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> bottom<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and on top of that the bottom kind of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.609 
and on top of that the bottom kind of
looks<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.310> Swiss<00:01:14.729> cheese<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:16.320> really

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
looks like Swiss cheese so not really

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.300 
looks like Swiss cheese so not really
worth<00:01:16.799> digging<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.850> fix<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.330> like

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
worth digging into it to fix that's like

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.620 
worth digging into it to fix that's like
I'm<00:01:20.310> gonna<00:01:20.520> go<00:01:20.670> ahead<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.939> I'll<00:01:21.240> close<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I'm gonna go ahead and I'll close the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
I'm gonna go ahead and I'll close the
hood<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.150> we'll<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.130> her

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
hood and we'll see see if we can get her

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
hood and we'll see see if we can get her
to<00:01:26.280> move<00:01:26.400> think<00:01:26.939> all<00:01:27.060> my<00:01:27.210> tires<00:01:27.450> are<00:01:27.630> still

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:12.100 

well<00:02:02.160> noisy<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.270> work

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:58.270 

Pepi<00:02:12.830> little<00:02:13.070> car

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
transmissions making a little bit of

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.229 
transmissions making a little bit of
noise

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239
