00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.650
 my love 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.650
 best 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.050
 it's time to experiment 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.270
 good youtube if planning and if you used 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
 small glasses but I do not need them anymore 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.520
 and well I'm going to teach you in this 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.460
 minecraft laboratory we are in 1.5 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.750
 point 1 the last version that has come out 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.570
 and well I will teach you how to make a 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.900
 nuclear missile and good how this will be done 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.300
 you will tell me then it is done like this first we have 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.769
 to have the goal that we want 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 explode in this case would be this 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.600
 poor village and good after you have to 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 take a tour because the missile will go 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.680
 in this case it would be for this site 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.809
 it would have to be all right that the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.339
 leaves these do not count but I would have to 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.979
 be all straight so that the missile does not 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.320
 explode because the missile explodes when 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.360
 when it hits a wall 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.869
 then the missile is going to be a main card 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.020
 tnt fairy ship good a a wagon 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.240
 a main car but several several 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.290
 I'll show you some good 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.600
 done here as a kind of like 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.360
 I've just put the roads 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.810
 in places where there are swings that 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.939
 they go up and down the tracks 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.720
 and they also give where we want them to turn 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.240
 but we are going to start the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.360
 via we are going to launch here 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.130
 we are going to prepare the site 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.409
 we put a button here 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.540
 and now we make a hole down here 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.790
 side of this is worth to do the magic 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.160
 we select or we have selected 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.040
 the train tracks you see what 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.320
 selected and now we start to 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.080
 put wagons with TNT I recommend 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.180
 like some pieces and I'm going to put it then 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.980
 that's about ten and good now in this 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.740
 case this looks like a normal station wagon 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.950
 but it's really a punch in a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.410
 on top of another then here this is 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.250
 would be bordered then to get out of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.080
 the ways to be guided would continue the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.340
 then it would continue moving 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160
 all the doubts 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.860
 all that judged rotate and here and then 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.560
 would raise this and lower and then everything 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.230
 continue straight until you reach the village 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.230
 well let's see it we give the button 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.410
 and after he stays silent I'm going 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.640
 to lower the sound for a moment 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.400
 then you see that it's like half a ship 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.230
 but but keep going forward we put you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.420
 that so that it does not hit anywhere 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.370
 but well you see that it's going to crash 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.120
 against what's there 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.610
 once it sounds different and good just 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.940
 explode and not be able to pull to take 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.940
 by sack 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.370
 and well, you know, it's a very 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.849
 powerful I think it's easy to do is not 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.129
 you do not need tricks or anything and look at the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.500
 chaos that you can cause to imagine that 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.440
 is that this apart here more or less 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.709
 over here is from here from here 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.080
 there is protected by a plugin 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.650
 which means that you can not destroy this 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.250
 zone but with this putting here a 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.590
 main card and throwing it good a main 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.019
 meat you already know the sleeves of one over 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.390
 from another the hub this you put here what 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.519
 send and go there then 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.660
 then you can exploit things as if in 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.269
 actually it 's like it's a canyon 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.609
 only that it is like remote control a 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.760
 Remote control car that explodes and good 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.760
 well 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.410
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.090
 this video and see you in the next 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.720
 explosion that says the following video 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.720
 goodbye
