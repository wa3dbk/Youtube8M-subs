size you know emergency blankets those

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.469 
size you know emergency blankets those
metallic<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.680> plastic<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:24.000> almost<00:01:24.180> look

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
metallic like plastic they almost look

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.429 
metallic like plastic they almost look
like<00:01:24.509> tin<00:01:25.020> foil<00:01:26.270> but<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> thicker<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
like tin foil but this is thicker and it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
like tin foil but this is thicker and it
actually<00:01:28.860> holds<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:29.640> heat<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.329> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
actually holds in more heat I think it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.310 
actually holds in more heat I think it's
somewhere<00:01:31.110> around<00:01:31.229> 80%<00:01:32.659> reflected<00:01:33.659> back<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
somewhere around 80% reflected back to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.120 
somewhere around 80% reflected back to
you<00:01:34.470> um<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.640> great<00:01:35.820> thing<00:01:36.030> about<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:37.130> is

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you um the great thing about this one is

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.569 
you um the great thing about this one is
that<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:39.240> velcros<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> sleeping<00:01:41.100> bag<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that it velcros like a sleeping bag it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.420 
that it velcros like a sleeping bag it
actually<00:01:42.299> goes<00:01:43.140> all<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> way<00:01:43.560> around<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
actually goes all the way around you and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.870 
actually goes all the way around you and
velcro's<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> seam<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:47.220> seal<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> side

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
velcro's up like a seam to seal the side

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.179 
velcro's up like a seam to seal the side
so<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.780> wrapping<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

so you're not just wrapping around you
like<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> blanket<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> drop<00:01:51.689> cloth<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.290> know

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
on top of you it's this actually seals

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.920

up

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.100 

um<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.880> are<00:02:00.940> also<00:02:01.240> good<00:02:01.720> for<00:02:02.080> use<00:02:02.850> with

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
for making up for that because this will

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.640 
for making up for that because this will
trap<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> lot<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.880> heat<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.990> light<00:02:26.350> I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
trap a lot of heat and it's light I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.150 
trap a lot of heat and it's light I
would<00:02:26.920> say<00:02:27.160> mmm<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.510> don't<00:02:29.320> know<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.740> exact

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.910 
I think just depends who you get it from
so<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:43.510> can<00:04:43.660> kind<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:43.990> guesstimate<00:04:44.560> it<00:04:44.710> from

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
so you can kind of guesstimate it from

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.030 
so you can kind of guesstimate it from
there<00:04:45.160> these<00:04:45.460> ponchos<00:04:46.410> probably<00:04:47.410> around<00:04:47.620> four

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
there these ponchos probably around four

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.070 
there these ponchos probably around four
dollars<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.670> my<00:04:49.000> guess<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.450> can't<00:04:49.660> remember<00:04:49.930> how

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
dollars is my guess I can't remember how

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.260 
dollars is my guess I can't remember how
much<00:04:50.230> I've<00:04:50.440> bought<00:04:50.620> these<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:51.460> have<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> few

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
of them though but they're great for

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.410
