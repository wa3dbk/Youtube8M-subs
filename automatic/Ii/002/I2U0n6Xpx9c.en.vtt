00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
example is that when you do your table

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709 
example is that when you do your table
of<00:00:37.770> contents<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.790> would<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.030> great<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.420> each<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
of contents it would be great if each of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.860 
of contents it would be great if each of
those<00:00:40.730> those<00:00:41.730> headings<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.480> table<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
those those headings in your table of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
those those headings in your table of
contents<00:00:43.219> could<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.329> segment<00:00:46.050> or

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
contents could actually be a segment or

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.119 
contents could actually be a segment or
a<00:00:46.500> story<00:00:47.539> we<00:00:48.539> call<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> publicity<00:00:49.620> hook

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so if you read that phrase in your it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.560 
so if you read that phrase in your it
might<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:54.770> something<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.879> three

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

ways to increase your GPA well that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
ways to increase your GPA well that
could<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.859> chapter<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:03.809> can

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
could be a chapter but that actually can

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
could be a chapter but that actually can
also<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.739> publicity<00:01:05.339> hook<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> reason<00:01:06.390> why

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
also be a publicity hook a reason why

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.670 
also be a publicity hook a reason why
