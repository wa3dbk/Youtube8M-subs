but the thing about your equipment is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
but the thing about your equipment is
that<00:00:36.330> it<00:00:36.449> has<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.720> be<00:00:36.840> used<00:00:37.110> well<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:38.340> has<00:00:38.550> the

that it has to be used well it has the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.390 
that it has to be used well it has the
potential<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.800> just<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.010> lot<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
potential to do just that a lot of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.490 
potential to do just that a lot of
damage<00:00:41.580> in<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.909> short<00:00:41.970> amount<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.449> time<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
damage in a short amount of time but it

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
damage in a short amount of time but it
has<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.860> used<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.339> the<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.729> time<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.300> else

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
has to be used at the right time or else

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.780 
has to be used at the right time or else
that<00:00:46.199> most<00:00:46.769> people<00:00:47.100> will<00:00:47.159> just<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.640> up

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
that most people will just end up

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.990 
that most people will just end up
whipping<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.330> throwing<00:00:48.629> knives<00:00:49.220> and<00:00:50.220> also<00:00:50.699> not

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
whipping on throwing knives and also not

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.399 
whipping on throwing knives and also not
hitting<00:00:51.330> anything<00:00:51.540> with<00:00:51.780> grenades<00:00:52.140> or

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
hitting anything with grenades or

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.710 
hitting anything with grenades or
hitting<00:00:52.920> someone<00:00:53.339> with<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
hitting someone with it but not at the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.180 
hitting someone with it but not at the
right<00:00:54.839> time<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.470> have<00:00:55.620> plenty<00:00:55.799> of<00:00:55.949> time

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
right time so they have plenty of time

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.130 
right time so they have plenty of time
to<00:00:56.220> recover<00:00:56.580> from<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> damage<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.049> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to recover from the damage so the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.979 
to recover from the damage so the
question<00:00:58.229> is<00:00:58.470> when<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:58.799> you<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.100> them<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.370> why

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
question is when do you use them and why

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.539 
question is when do you use them and why
so<00:01:00.989> let<00:01:01.140> me<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.350> replay<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.890> clip<00:01:02.159> for<00:01:02.400> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
probably not going to outgun them at

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.560 
probably not going to outgun them at
that<00:01:32.310> point<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> threw<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> throwing<00:01:33.539> knife

you<00:02:41.709> also<00:02:41.890> don't<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.459> too<00:02:42.640> late

come out of the animation I chucked that

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.790 
come out of the animation I chucked that
lightning<00:03:16.660> grenade<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.170> wall<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.739> the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
lightning grenade on the wall to the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.400 
lightning grenade on the wall to the
left<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.480> knowing<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.140> know<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
left and knowing that you know the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.070 
left and knowing that you know the
arcing<00:03:20.950> tree<00:03:21.280> comes<00:03:21.670> out<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.360> right<00:03:22.540> now

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
arcing tree comes out to the right now

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.690 
arcing tree comes out to the right now
obviously<00:03:23.530> that's<00:03:23.830> how<00:03:23.950> those<00:03:24.130> grenades<00:03:24.430> work

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
obviously that's how those grenades work

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.610 
obviously that's how those grenades work
so<00:03:25.330> we'll<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.569> make<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.350> they're

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
so we'll just make it so that they're

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.560 
so we'll just make it so that they're
going<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:26.829> be<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.190> area<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.850> effect<00:03:28.000> and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
going to be in that area of effect and

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.270 
going to be in that area of effect and
they're<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.320> have<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.590> react<00:03:29.920> quickly

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
they're going to have to react quickly

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.380 
they're going to have to react quickly
and<00:03:30.519> if<00:03:30.579> they<00:03:30.700> don't<00:03:30.940> they're<00:03:31.120> going<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.329> get

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
and if they don't they're going to get

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.090 
and if they don't they're going to get
punished<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.290> that's<00:03:32.380> exactly<00:03:32.590> what

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
punished for it and that's exactly what

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.979 
punished for it and that's exactly what

grenade here I wanted that special ammo

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.180 
grenade here I wanted that special ammo
so<00:04:07.959> if<00:04:08.049> he<00:04:08.170> was<00:04:08.290> gonna<00:04:08.410> get<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.920> was<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.130> to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
so if he was gonna get it I was going to

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.920 
so if he was gonna get it I was going to
make<00:04:09.310> sure<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.489> he<00:04:09.700> paid<00:04:09.910> for<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:10.390> then<00:04:10.900> a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
make sure that he paid for it and then a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.990 
make sure that he paid for it and then a
guy<00:04:11.109> comes<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.500> behind<00:04:11.650> me<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.340> kits<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.820> kill

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
guy comes in behind me and kits the kill

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.430 
guy comes in behind me and kits the kill
but<00:04:13.180> he<00:04:13.359> can't<00:04:13.570> get<00:04:13.690> out<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:13.989> grenade<00:04:14.320> in

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
but he can't get out of my grenade in

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.529 
but he can't get out of my grenade in
time<00:04:14.650> two<00:04:15.160> kills<00:04:15.430> for<00:04:15.640> one<00:04:15.790> grenade<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.269> always

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
time two kills for one grenade is always

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.380 
time two kills for one grenade is always
a<00:04:16.570> good<00:04:16.870> trade-off<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.609> grenades<00:04:18.940> are<00:04:19.090> great

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
a good trade-off so grenades are great

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.120 
a good trade-off so grenades are great
for<00:04:19.600> doing<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.930> catching<00:04:20.380> people<00:04:20.680> off<00:04:20.799> off

on two you can go one on one by

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.579 
on two you can go one on one by
eliminating<00:05:55.569> one<00:05:55.899> person<00:05:56.319> from<00:05:56.409> the
