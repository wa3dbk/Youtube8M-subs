00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello guys and girls I'm robbie and here 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 I'm back with all of you and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.370
 welcome to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.349
 we are in the axis of alain and good you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.179
 I'm going to bring today that I was here 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.799
 quietly walking and I have been told 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.029
 there steal that a new cliché has come out 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.590
 a new trick of unlimited r &amp; b good the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 truth is not really a new trick 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.269
 I was in the previous updates 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.269
 but they have not repaired it, they have not 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.099
 patched we are in version 1.11 that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 that came out yesterday and well I'm 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.730
 here facing this it seems that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.860
 I have hit shots I will tell you 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.719
 guys to do this trick that is the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.520
 truth is very simple we are going to have to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.500
 be at least with a friend because 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.350
 let's go into a mission a version 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.399
 in versus and what we have to do is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.289
 enter as that host to that mission 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.930
 what we have to do is go to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.210
 our pause menu to the online menu and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 from there we go to activities that is the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.260
 first option that there are going to be 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 host of an activity and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.300
 we select the ones created by rockstar 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.270
 once you select the city ​​or roast ar 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.050
 we have the missions versus and we choose 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.510
 the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.100
 the corrupt cop one of the mythical 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.410
 missions is also one of the first 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.300
 missions that there are with extremes once in 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.840
 the loading screen we have a little bit 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.580
 in a hurry because what happens is that it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.260
 we can get any staff no longer 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.610
 only the friends but any 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.710
 person that we do not even have 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.180
 created the console because it is going away 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.410
 will join if we are not and we are not capable 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 things that happened to me then 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.260
 we invite our friend that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.330
 obviously will go on the opposing team 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.610
 and as I say we have to be at least 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.750
 two people to the screen 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.870
 departure start the mission once 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 start we take any good car 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.800
 I'm not going to catch it because it 's pretty 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.660
 slow I'm used to going in cars 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.030
 in luxury cars by car is pretty 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.280
 fast and before trying the mission with 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 this and it costs to get there 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 a lot of time what we have to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 to do is to go to the military base that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 well it is known worldwide its 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.960
 position and we're going to go to this area of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.060
 here is what you know and if not what 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.860
 you know now after the tunnel you have 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.110
 an area where we can enter if 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.060
 our car allows us because it is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.030
 good to reach astronomical speeds 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.660
 we can enter by jumping the fence and masters 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.660
 run 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 a little better than me that is a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.730
 little bit more speed then you can 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.150
 jump all but good nothing happens 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.310
 if that happens to you, here is an entry and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.930
 what we have to do is good in the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.220
 Star level is guaranteed a 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.550
 Once we enter but well let's go to 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.100
 an area that is the one on the left in the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.140
 which is pauner more number of enemies 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.210
 It can normally be any area 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.580
 to do the trick there is no need to 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.200
 do it any specific area but what 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 it is better that they begin to put us as 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.070
 there I do not know why I did not stamp anymore 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.430
 with that tank the area in which 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.320
 the tanks appear and what is going to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.780
 to happen is that every time they kill us, 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.730
 we commit suicide or we lose the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.080
 life with the mission is not going to restart 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.670
 and what is going to happen is that they are going to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.700
 give 400 points 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.640
 rp unlimitedly and every time 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.470
 that we want is more there are several ways to 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.550
 see let's see if the tank is or not 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.550
 there is no way there is no way to die 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.770
 several ways to face this trick 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.140
 worth one of them is the first 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.060
 I'm doing that is walking the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.500
 base until a tank throws a 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.230
 pepinazo 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.570
 or military I hit you then a few 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.600
 shots and I kill you another one of the things that you 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.450
 can do is walk around the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.470
 street thing that I do not do but but that 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.760
 well it's also quite efficient 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.980
 because of four or five shots that you 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.500
 catch some military or a shot a bombshell 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.500
 of those between the tanks because you finish 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.990
 fried turned killed and the third way 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.730
 I can think of what you can do is 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.010
 leave the command posed and you 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.140
 calmly every 15 minutes move 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.870
 a little bit because if you do not already know that 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.190
 made us to be more than 15 minutes without 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.810
 activity takes us out of the game of 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.030
 online mode so you can do is 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.430
 calmly, you leave the car 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.080
 stopped you're going to have a coffee one 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.000
 sweets or whatever you want some potatoes 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.440
 fried and lying, then the trick goes away 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.570
 doing the solito you do not have to be 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.760
 not even in front of the screen and 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.709
 nothing guys as you see there the level goes 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.209
 rising little by little from 400 in 400 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.190
 men for high levels the truth 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.640
 It may be a little bit boring but 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.890
 to go up to level 40 level 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.860
 at level 50 and so on it's pretty easy 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.210
 pretty fast and as I say you do not have 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.160
 even that being in front of the console 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.780
 so that the trick is carried out 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.040
 and nothing guys take the opportunity to tell you 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.840
 we remember that you have in the description
