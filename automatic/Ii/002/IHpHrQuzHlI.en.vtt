flying<00:00:27.630> tips<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.830> sailplane<00:00:29.220> flies<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.150> much

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
flying tips this sailplane flies so much

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179 
flying tips this sailplane flies so much
like<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> real<00:00:30.929> thing<00:00:30.960> even<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> point<00:00:32.040> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
like the real thing even to the point of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.930 
like the real thing even to the point of
stalling<00:00:32.690> under<00:00:33.690> similar<00:00:33.930> circumstances<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
stalling under similar circumstances it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.120 
stalling under similar circumstances it
took<00:00:36.240> me<00:00:36.390> quite<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.750> while<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.080> tame<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> real

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
took me quite a while to tame the real

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.040 
took me quite a while to tame the real
thing<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.030> been<00:00:39.300> well<00:00:39.570> worth<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
thing but it's been well worth it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.840 
thing but it's been well worth it
especially<00:00:40.170> now<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.250> simulated

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
especially now we have a simulated

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
especially now we have a simulated
version<00:00:51.200> now<00:00:52.200> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.440> easily<00:00:52.650> hit<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.220> toe

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
version now you can easily hit your toe

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.940 
version now you can easily hit your toe
but<00:00:54.240> I<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> rely<00:00:55.050> totally<00:00:55.380> on<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.860> air

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
but I like to rely totally on the air

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.610 
but I like to rely totally on the air
current<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.490> get<00:00:56.700> me<00:00:56.880> flying<00:00:57.500> there's<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
current to get me flying there's a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580 
current to get me flying there's a
thermal<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.490> car<00:00:59.760> park<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.900> throw<00:01:01.230> into

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
thermal over the car park so throw into

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.070 
thermal over the car park so throw into
a<00:01:01.650> light<00:01:01.920> breeze<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.640> circle<00:01:03.120> back<00:01:03.150> into<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
a light breeze and circle back into the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:17.230 
a light breeze and circle back into the
thermal

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.060 

the<00:01:18.240> trick<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.780> turn<00:01:19.229> away<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.620> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the trick is to turn away from the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
the trick is to turn away from the
breeze<00:01:20.340> after<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> launch<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.720> head<00:01:22.170> towards

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
breeze after you launch and head towards

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:34.130 
breeze after you launch and head towards
the<00:01:22.740> thermal<00:01:24.950> not<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:32.600> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.840> don't

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the thermal not like this if you don't

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
the thermal not like this if you don't
keep<00:01:34.410> your<00:01:34.470> air<00:01:34.800> speed<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.880> simply<00:01:36.270> won't

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
keep your air speed up you simply won't

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.249 
keep your air speed up you simply won't
make<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.410> thermal<00:01:39.110> remember<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> are

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
make it to the thermal remember you are

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.310 
make it to the thermal remember you are
flying<00:01:40.800> away<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.090> oncoming<00:01:42.509> breeze<00:01:42.960> at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
flying away from the oncoming breeze at

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.320 
flying away from the oncoming breeze at
this<00:01:43.590> point<00:01:44.390> make<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> shallow<00:01:45.930> climb<00:01:47.330> then

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
this point make a shallow climb then

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.370 
this point make a shallow climb then
turn<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> shallow<00:01:49.560> dive<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.960> once<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
turn with a shallow dive and once you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.710 
turn with a shallow dive and once you
hit<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.740> lift<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.759> sky<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.180> yours<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:57.539> can

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
hit the lift the sky is yours you can

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:35.610 
hit the lift the sky is yours you can
move<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.910> thermal

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.410 

so<00:02:36.620> let's<00:02:36.890> move<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.310> onto<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.700> slope<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
so let's move up onto the slope with the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.740 
so let's move up onto the slope with the
thermal<00:02:38.810> boo<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:43.040> make<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.340> bearing<00:02:43.970> for<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
thermal boo just make a bearing for the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.770 
thermal boo just make a bearing for the
thermal<00:02:45.200> over<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> carpark<00:02:46.300> use<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.510> shadow

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
thermal over the carpark use the shadow

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:58.199 
thermal over the carpark use the shadow
for<00:02:48.470> perspective

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.789 

now<00:02:59.209> we're<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.719> slope<00:03:00.049> let's<00:03:00.409> try<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
now we're on the slope let's try the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:05:25.170 
now we're on the slope let's try the
slope<00:03:01.219> version

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.240 

you
