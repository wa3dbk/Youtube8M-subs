so<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.060> would<00:02:08.269> just<00:02:08.300> push<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.019> on<00:02:12.610> next<00:02:13.610> put

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
so you would just push this on next put

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.410 
so you would just push this on next put
the<00:02:13.730> blue<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.150> course<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.510> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the blue and of course on it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.690 
the blue and of course on it
and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:16.140> after<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.680> figures<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.370> now<00:02:17.640> for

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and then after the figures there now for

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.460 
and then after the figures there now for
the<00:02:18.000> arms<00:02:18.450> there<00:02:18.720> yeah<00:02:19.080> there's<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> little

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the arms there yeah there's a little

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.380 
the arms there yeah there's a little
hole<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.520> peg<00:02:20.700> hole<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.120> each

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
hole here this for the peg hole on each

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
hole here this for the peg hole on each
of<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.570> side<00:02:21.950> now<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> same<00:02:23.310> thing<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.580> would

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
of the side now the same thing you would

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.910 
of the side now the same thing you would
do<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.030> would<00:02:24.270> push<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.410> simple<00:02:25.830> as

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
do it you would push it on as simple as

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
do it you would push it on as simple as
this<00:02:26.690> okay<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:27.960> we<00:02:28.050> go

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
this okay there we go

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.560 
this okay there we go
now<00:02:28.920> push<00:02:29.130> down<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.700> same<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.210> other<00:02:30.360> arm

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
now push down and same for the other arm

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.590 
now push down and same for the other arm
you<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:31.020> push<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.710> band<00:02:32.390> you've<00:02:33.390> got

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
you just push it on and band you've got

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.920 
you just push it on and band you've got
yourself<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.080> sub<00:02:34.260> Ultron<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:36.210> we'll<00:02:36.810> be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
yourself a sub Ultron and we'll be

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.690 
yourself a sub Ultron and we'll be
moving<00:02:37.020> on<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.560> detail<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.040> articulation<00:02:38.250> in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
moving on to detail and articulation in

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
moving on to detail and articulation in
about<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> second<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> detail<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.710> this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
about a second so the detail for this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.410 
about a second so the detail for this
figure<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.250> looks<00:02:41.400> pretty<00:02:41.670> nice<00:02:41.880> against<00:02:42.270> a

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
figure it looks pretty nice against a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.440 
figure it looks pretty nice against a
transparent<00:02:43.230> purple<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.160> some<00:02:44.940> metallic

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
paint on it with some blue eyes now for

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.440 
paint on it with some blue eyes now for
articulation<00:02:49.050> wise<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:50.550> don't<00:02:51.240> know<00:02:51.300> what<00:02:51.390> to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
articulation wise I don't know what to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.090 
articulation wise I don't know what to
call<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.410> rollers<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.010> bottom

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
call this but the rollers on the bottom

articulation the head has 0 untick
ulation<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:17.940> fine<00:03:18.270> but<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.549> don't

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
ulation which is fine but so I don't

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.580 
ulation which is fine but so I don't
know<00:03:20.640> why<00:03:20.910> they<00:03:21.120> couldn't<00:03:21.299> do<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.260> 2

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
know why they couldn't do it but it is 2

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.180 
know why they couldn't do it but it is 2
inches<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> don't<00:03:23.340> speck<00:03:23.549> too<00:03:23.730> much<00:03:23.910> from<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
inches so I don't speck too much from it

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.680 
all the way the arms also articulation
not<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.310> much<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:05.940> know<00:04:05.970> it's<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.540> little

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
not so much but you know it's a little

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.440 
not so much but you know it's a little
bit<00:04:06.900> other<00:04:07.739> armors<00:04:08.100> articulation<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.060> for

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
bit other armors articulation and for

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.259 
bit other armors articulation and for
the<00:04:09.510> legs<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.680> legs<00:04:10.709> can<00:04:11.250> not<00:04:11.489> move<00:04:11.670> back<00:04:12.030> and

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
the legs the legs can not move back and

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.160 
the legs the legs can not move back and
the<00:04:12.329> reason<00:04:12.420> why<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.660> because<00:04:12.690> he<00:04:12.900> has<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.019> small

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
the reason why is because he has a small

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.550 
the reason why is because he has a small
cap<00:04:13.500> on<00:04:13.680> here<00:04:14.329> but

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
cap on here but

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.259 
cap on here but
the<00:04:16.709> legs<00:04:16.920> can<00:04:17.040> only<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.549> move<00:04:17.730> front<00:04:18.030> and

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
the legs can only really move front and

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.690 
the legs can only really move front and
you<00:04:18.329> kind<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.720> make<00:04:18.870> them<00:04:19.019> sit<00:04:19.230> down<00:04:19.670> but<00:04:20.670> I

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
you kind of make them sit down but I

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.170 
you kind of make them sit down but I
can't<00:04:20.910> really<00:04:21.000> move<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.420> back<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:23.180> yeah

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
can't really move that back and yeah

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.190

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200
