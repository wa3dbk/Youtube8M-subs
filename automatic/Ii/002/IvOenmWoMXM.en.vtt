00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.389
 tricks for minecraft and I'm going to seal you 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.950
 a map totally without voice does not require 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.350
 in any way that lets you add 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.360
 little birds of colors there is one red another 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.300
 brown we have them over there water 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.710
 bathing and are distributed all over 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.810
 the server and we can have them as 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.820
 pets in our homes that is 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.010
 super nice and all this done with 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.920
 combat blog or the creator is a 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.420
 authentic crack and we will also be able to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.370
 make a flying machine that you 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.499
 allows to fly across the sky of bain 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.449
 craft and you 're going to love the 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.690
 creator I'll leave it in the description 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.210
 It's worth the channel and well, here we have 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.370
 all all we need to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.079
 start all this that is this button and 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.659
 When you start things, they start to 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.949
 generate birds then good here 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.679
 we have the head of the bruno bird 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.690
 number 1 the beige red and this what has 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.339
 taken as reference to the good creator 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.409
 come on let's see all this that kike 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.059
 Quique bonito is everything and good here I have 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.740
 the little birds that with seeds 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.340
 we can actually control look when 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.340
 I put my hands 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.130
 well it seems that they are two very rare this 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.350
 it looks like two are red too 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.600
 is that in fact they are two but they are 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.229
 that's how they're making love look at them now 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.229
 there are two that are totally merged 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.210
 look at them today I had two that are and well 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.979
 this mud has like the tail of 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.560
 beige button has a button on it 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.750
 well it has three buttons and then the red one 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.729
 you can see it to bake here 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.679
 because if the wagons next to each other look 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.869
 they start to fight and like that 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.149
 it works but well the red have three 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.890
 torches of straight this ball more is more 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.429
 striking and when we put on 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.429
 seeds at hand 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.700
 after eating and everything once in a while 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.409
 they eat when they get out of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.599
 noses is also because good sometimes 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.920
 they are not hungry and other times they are 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.990
 they can also be killed and they get 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 blood in fact half kill this the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.830
 a hundred small 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.539
 and has seen what a cool and good if we want 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.759
 one in our house because with seeds 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.670
 we can take them for example 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.880
 this small and they also tend to grow a 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.579
 little bit more than usual and well let's go 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.989
 to do something else that I want you to see and 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.420
 so we have to make a source of 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.350
 power to make a new table of 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.960
 character 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.270
 and what I'm saying is going to 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.860
 need a lighter to burn and we're going 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.020
 to release a star from hell and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.760
 you are going to see what happens from xestosa when you 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.380
 loose here the star of hell of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.520
 Suddenly or such it is created as a button 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.260
 of power is this is called power shows and 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.420
 this with this we will be able to make a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.740
 new karate table or will you say and how do you 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.930
 makes the new tractor dam pos here 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.930
 the tco we are simply going to need a 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.720
 pitcher or a dispenser a frame picture 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.350
 we place it like this for example in this 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.480
 tree and above it llÃ­ria the picture and inside 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.270
 for the source of power that I have told you 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.460
 before and suddenly look what happens and you 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.740
 this new piece of table of 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.800
 crack teo that allows us to do two 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.680
 things allows us to make the machine to 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.270
 fly is worth what the vest would be 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.030
 of the machine to fly now now 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.970
 we will see and a potato that gives you 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.410
 all of maximum health to do it 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.990
 we would simply put here the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 ingredients that are these I already have 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.900
 placed here would be something like that and it would come out 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.520
 the button out you see you have seen and 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.350
 it's just to activate them and see what 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.510
 nice is this but good the creator and 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.670
 its crack but how it does this is 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.450
 amazing and now going to petar is going to come out 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.980
 suddenly fire up and you'll see 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.440
 same super cool it's worth there we have another 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.630
 flying bird fly and everything and what 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 nice you have never seen him flying this is 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.770
 the first one that you see flying see what 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.250
 good things you have already seen has petado 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.160
 and he has given us an omelette what noses is 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.260
 this is so language I do not know but good you 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.790
 health data that comes in handy and 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.100
 we can also do what is the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.660
 vest for the flying machine that is 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.610
 what all of you are of that act then 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.550
 quiet they looked at the dreams this what 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.350
 let's remove to make the vest and 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.299
 I already have it done here we are going to have 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.820
 that place this in this way you have to 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.000
 we need a jump position one 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.710
 Chest of iron is worth these objects here 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.260
 what are eggs 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.169
 the enchanted book with feather fall 4 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.889
 vale and two other bird feathers 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.360
 suddenly the button comes out the active voice and 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.449
 now they are going to give us the super 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.889
 vest that will come out now you will see going to 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.389
 pass the fire upwards than before 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.279
 we have lost it but good if it comes out 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.949
 fire up that means then 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:51.259
 that the bag machine has finished is worth and 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.749
 very cool the flying machine you go 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.279
 to flip you will love it and we will 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.960
 expect this to be done for the one 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:59.719
 I want to see the map I just tell you 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.599
 downloads you put it in your folder 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:03.889
 saints of minecraft and that's it and you open it 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.210
 and you can play it 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.990
 as you want it in the description 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.909
 but vote like before you pick it up good 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.009
 we are going to wait for this to be done 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.770
 is not only a little bit like a 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.599
 hot oven here we go small and 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.180
 you'll see the flying machine is 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.949
 amazing is worth seeing 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.690
 it has to be very little I do not want it 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.979
 touch I 'm not going to make you blow this up 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.180
 Smoke does not see him again there 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.550
 means that we already have here our 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.740
 vest that we can not place and everything 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.810
 if we want we put it here and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.180
 we can jump and we have no damage or 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.039
 fall or anything is worth but what I want is 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.960
 make a flying machine to do the 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.280
 flying machine this is what you carry 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.860
 waiting we're going to need a mannequin 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.700
 a hat and the vest that we just 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.700
 do obviously 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.980
 this is going to hallucinate 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.830
 in fact I'm going to an island or something 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.150
 so you can see how it is worth 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.360
 let's place the mannequin 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.230
 a leather hat and now comes what 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.860
 fat to see see to see this out there 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:14.120
 suddenly when we put here the 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.320
 vest the new bib already knows 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.880
 that is amazing amazing 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.650
 Awesome 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.480
 these would be flags and we can 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.760
 go up and we have our flying machine 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.030
 forever is worth never never breaks 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.380
 nothing and you want to brief and want 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.240
 let's try it, we used to peg 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.060
 approve it so you can see it simply 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.920
 click and it lets you fly all over the 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.450
 world of minecraft to control it 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.250
 just looking for where you 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.510
 you want to go they want to go there 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.280
 for those little birds, for those 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.050
 little birds that wants to climb up 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.900
 then you pull up and that's it 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.700
 ok, I move to where I point 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.920
 with which you are in fact look at what 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.690
 last and this in survival right now 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.200
 I have the creative but if I put the 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.680

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.870
 the same goes, I'm flying to where 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.940
 I want I could already fly because I am 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.500

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.900
 that is not not everyone can be 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.550

 below the description who is the dad 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.430
 before picking it up or seeing it on time 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.170
 there is that in the video it is worth it, it is necessary to 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.490
 it costs nothing and it helps me a lot and 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.130
 nothing left you with a new map 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.290
