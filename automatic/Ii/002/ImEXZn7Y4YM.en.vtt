00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.410 
eShop as well and again it's a pretty
simple<00:01:44.410> concept<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:45.190> get<00:01:45.340> two<00:01:45.490> pictures<00:01:45.940> very

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
simple concept you get two pictures very

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.840 
simple concept you get two pictures very
similar<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.200> appearance<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:47.830> with<00:01:48.399> very

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
similar in appearance but with very

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.880 
similar in appearance but with very
subtle<00:01:49.300> differences<00:01:49.810> find<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.410> differences

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
subtle differences find the differences

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.969 
subtle differences find the differences
to<00:01:50.950> progress<00:01:51.429> use<00:01:52.000> hints<00:01:52.360> if<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.600> must<00:01:52.899> I<00:01:53.259> have

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
to progress use hints if you must I have

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:02.650 
to progress use hints if you must I have
a<00:01:54.039> freaking<00:01:54.490> headache

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.640 

so<00:02:03.660> there<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.870> three<00:02:04.050> difficulty<00:02:04.620> levels

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
so there are three difficulty levels

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.460 
so there are three difficulty levels
each<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.510> less<00:02:06.540> differences

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
each one with more or less differences

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.350 
each one with more or less differences
to<00:02:07.620> find<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.310> game<00:02:08.460> strings<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.000> photos

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to find the game strings the photos

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.450 
to find the game strings the photos
together<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.990> levels<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:11.160> only<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
together like levels and you only have a

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.880 
together like levels and you only have a
few<00:02:11.670> hints<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.240> work<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.440> actually

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
few hints to work with so it's actually

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.190 
few hints to work with so it's actually
kind<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.160> arcade<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.900> can't

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
kind of arcade like in that they can't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.310 
kind of arcade like in that they can't
just<00:02:16.290> keep<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.370> until<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.790> lose<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:19.020> course

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
just keep going until you lose of course

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.390 
just keep going until you lose of course
