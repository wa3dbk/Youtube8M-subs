okay<00:02:00.890> we<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.040> our<00:02:02.189> normal<00:02:02.600> signal<00:02:03.600> socket

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
okay we have our normal signal socket

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.440 
okay we have our normal signal socket
area

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.279 

and<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.600> difference<00:02:07.930> that<00:02:07.960> we're<00:02:08.140> going<00:02:08.229> to

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
and the difference that we're going to

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.920 
and the difference that we're going to
make<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.860> you're<00:02:09.039> going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> turn<00:02:09.490> her<00:02:09.959> twice

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
make is you're going to turn her twice

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.110 
make is you're going to turn her twice
the<00:02:13.930> two<00:02:14.410> things<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.100> are<00:02:15.489> different<00:02:15.940> in

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the two things that are different in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.660 
the two things that are different in
that<00:02:16.209> lead<00:02:18.209> one<00:02:19.209> you're<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.410> start<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
that lead one you're going to start the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.000 
that lead one you're going to start the
turn<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.390> little<00:02:22.989> bit<00:02:23.230> sooner<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.770> little

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
turn a little bit sooner and a little

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.790 
turn a little bit sooner and a little
bit<00:02:24.100> quicker<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.870> you're<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.200> actually

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
bit quicker and you're going to actually

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.830 
bit quicker and you're going to actually
guide<00:02:27.010> her<00:02:27.489> through<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.330> turn<00:02:30.209> with<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.450> little

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
guide her through the turn with a little

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.290 
guide her through the turn with a little
bit<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.050> pressure<00:02:32.760> guiding<00:02:33.760> her<00:02:34.000> around

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
bit of pressure guiding her around

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.270 
bit of pressure guiding her around
through<00:02:35.230> your<00:02:35.319> connections<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.069> father

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
through your connections and the father

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.250 
through your connections and the father
is<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.790> respond<00:02:37.269> with<00:02:37.540> upward<00:02:38.019> pressure

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
is I can respond with upward pressure

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.470 
is I can respond with upward pressure
during<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.430> soon<00:02:39.580> as<00:02:39.700> he<00:02:39.850> releases<00:02:40.120> his

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
during that as soon as he releases his

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.340 
during that as soon as he releases his
hand<00:02:40.750> down<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.739> can<00:02:41.920> stop<00:02:42.750> nice<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.989> slow

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
hand down you can stop nice and slow

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.949 
hand down you can stop nice and slow
it's<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.190> heavy<00:02:45.730> duty<00:02:46.180> pressure<00:02:46.360> nice

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
it's not like heavy duty pressure nice

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.910 
it's not like heavy duty pressure nice
and<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.850> okay<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:49.989> can<00:02:50.230> use<00:02:50.380> these<00:02:50.560> Delta

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
and so okay so you can use these Delta

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580 
and so okay so you can use these Delta
turns<00:02:51.209> anyplace<00:02:52.209> we<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:52.870> used<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.290> talk<00:02:53.470> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
turns anyplace we just used to talk to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.020 
turns anyplace we just used to talk to
her<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.769> as<00:02:53.860> an<00:02:54.040> example<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.580> separately

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
her and as an example of separately

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.240 
her and as an example of separately
equal<00:02:55.330> food<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.780> then<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> last<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.010> we

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
equal food and then the last one that we

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.940 
equal food and then the last one that we
did<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.730> turn<00:02:58.239> from<00:02:58.720> clothes<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.260> clothes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
did is turn from clothes to clothes

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.910 
did is turn from clothes to clothes
looks<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.230> started<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.470> 6<00:03:02.709> count

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
looks like this started with the 6 count

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.090 
looks like this started with the 6 count
basic<00:03:08.310> ok<00:03:09.310> we<00:03:09.850> get<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.150> nice<00:03:10.450> stretch<00:03:11.019> on<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
basic ok we get that nice stretch on the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.710 
basic ok we get that nice stretch on the
