okay
this<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.370> my<00:04:53.580> ETS<00:04:56.870> switch<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:59.400> this<00:04:59.640> is<00:04:59.760> my

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
this is my ETS switch and this is my

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.720 
this is my ETS switch and this is my
flasher<00:05:00.390> switch<00:05:00.420> so<00:05:01.230> I'm<00:05:01.290> going<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.670> I'm<00:05:02.670> going

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
flasher switch so I'm going to I'm going

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.550 
flasher switch so I'm going to I'm going
to<00:05:02.880> insert<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.330> that's<00:05:03.960> going<00:05:04.170> to<00:05:04.230> go<00:05:04.350> right

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
to insert that that's going to go right

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.090 
to insert that that's going to go right
in<00:05:04.770> just<00:05:05.730> like<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.000> clicks<00:05:06.690> right<00:05:06.960> in<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:07.920> this

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
in just like so clicks right in and this

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
in just like so clicks right in and this
one's<00:05:08.310> going<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.520> be<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.670> little<00:05:08.820> bit<00:05:09.000> more

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
one's going to be a little bit more

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.630 
one's going to be a little bit more
trickier<00:05:09.750> that's<00:05:10.440> going<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.740> insert<00:05:11.310> which

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
trickier that's going to insert which

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.240 
trickier that's going to insert which
that<00:05:12.000> clipped<00:05:12.300> right<00:05:12.570> in<00:05:12.750> okay<00:05:13.560> now<00:05:13.740> I'm<00:05:14.010> going
