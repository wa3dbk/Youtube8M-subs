00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:14.290
 iris anatomy the iris forms the part 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.620
 most anterior of the vascular layer of the eye 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.880
 its appearance is that of a disc with a 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.820
 central hole 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.429
 the pupil whose diameter changes 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.310
 continuously to control the amount 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.710
 of light that penetrates the eye the iris 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.010
 locate between the anterior chamber and the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.950
 posterior behind the cornea and in front 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.780
 of the lens is about 12 millimeters 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.050
 of diameter and from 0 3 to 0 5 millimeters of 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.289
 thickness when we look at an eye we see the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.899
 white part sclera or sclera 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.390
 colored iris and black pupil the 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.789
 cornea and the anterior chamber we do not see them 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 because they are transparent but we can 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.239
 visualize those with slit lamp 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 origin of the word iris in the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.390
 Greek mythology in the works of Homer 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.090
 iris is the messenger of the gods in the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.190
 Iliad and the personification of the bow 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.760
 Iris in the Odyssey 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.160
 iris in greek means rainbow in 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.380
 anatomy the iris is the anterior part of 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.990
 vascular layer of the eye changes 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.210
 appearance and color from one person to another and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.420
 from one moment to another in the same person 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.550
 according to the ambient light the color of the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.160
 Eyes depends on the appearance of the iris 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.490
 which is the only internal body that 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 can see clearly from the outside 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.760
 anterior face of the iris is convex e 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.220
 irregular melanin is responsible for 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.900
 color of the iris along with a pattern 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.510
 crypt complex of focs freckles 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.570
 nodules of wolf lynn and grooves produced 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.200
 by contraction of the dilated nodules 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.060
 of wolf link are somewhat elevated 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.210
 whitish or yellowish and usually 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.600
 peripherals are formed by fibers of 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.170
 connective tissue and appear in 10% of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.180
 Normal blue especially blue between 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.930
 the inner third and two thirds 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.250
 external a small circle is appreciated 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.300
 called collarette that the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.220
 in two zones pupils and ciliary area 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.350
 pupil is narrower 1 to 3 millimeters 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.040
 contains the pigmentary pupillary margin 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.890
 very evident in this iris the area of 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.950
 sphincter much more visible in eyes 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.230
 clear and the area of ​​crypts restore of 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.050
 oblitera 2 vessels of the pupillary membrane 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.870
 embryonic on occasion there are crypts in 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.720
 all the iris the sphincter muscle 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.620
 It has a ring shape and responds to the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.820
 light decreasing pupillary size 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.400
 Ciliary area miosis is wider 3 to 5 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.430
 millimeters and traveled by a system 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.890
 radial from center to periphery the tissue 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.950
 superficial of the anterior face of the iris 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.350
 of clear eyes are available in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.810
 radial both in the pupillary area and in 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.330
 filiar because it translates the structure 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.540
 vascular and connective tissue 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.970
 anterior stroma in the dark eyes is 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.970
 very obvious the radial arrangement of the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.000
 pupillary area but the ciliary area is smooth 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.460
 because hidden mechanical pigmentation 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.230
 the vascular and tissue architecture 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.960
 connective posterior face of the iris is more 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.790
 smooth and darker than the previous one because 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.400
 it is covered by the epithelium 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.520
 pigmentary posterior presents three 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.510
 systems girth leds 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.320
 corresponding with those of the face 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.260
 anterior flange pupilar collarette and 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.320
 periphery and lightweight and two systems of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.990
 radial perpendicular grooves in the 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.840
 Pupillary area and circulars in the area 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.830
 affiliate where you can see folds that 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.690
 translate the action of the dilator muscle 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.830
 similar to those found in the area 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.740
 ciliary of the anterior face 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.050
 root relationships of the iris the root 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.690
 of the iris is continued behind with the 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.900
 ciliary body formed by the muscle 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.110
 ciliary ciliary processes and the wall 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.510
 flat in the front part between the iris 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.000
 and the cornea is formed the angle of the 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.640
 anterior chamber where there is a 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.520
 mesh structure called 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.920
 trabecular aqueous humor occur 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.470
 the ciliary processes from 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.870
 blood plasma of its capillaries is 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.420
 collects in the rear chamber behind the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.760
 iris passes to the anterior chamber through 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.120
 of the pupil and seeps into the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.890
 traveling towards the slime channel from 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.890
 where it passes to the general circulation
