the<00:01:01.530> aek-971<00:01:02.530> everyone's<00:01:03.010> favorite<00:01:03.310> assault

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
the aek-971 everyone's favorite assault

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.150 
the aek-971 everyone's favorite assault
rifle<00:01:03.970> back<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.450> battlefield<00:01:04.990> 3<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.470> would<00:01:06.070> have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
rifle back in battlefield 3 I would have

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.890 
rifle back in battlefield 3 I would have
to<00:01:06.250> say<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.580> was<00:01:06.610> my<00:01:06.880> favorite<00:01:07.120> as<00:01:07.390> well<00:01:07.420> I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
to say that was my favorite as well I

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.060 
to say that was my favorite as well I
don't<00:01:08.050> think<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.350> was<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.590> best<00:01:08.740> assault

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
don't think it was the best assault

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.980 
don't think it was the best assault
rifle<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.670> would<00:01:10.000> have<00:01:10.150> to<00:01:10.300> give<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.870> the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
rifle I would have to give that to the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.470 
rifle I would have to give that to the
m16a3<00:01:11.620> because<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.310> was<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:12.640> simply<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.180> laser

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
m16a3 because it was just simply a laser

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.510 
m16a3 because it was just simply a laser
beam<00:01:13.780> but<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.470> really<00:01:14.740> enjoyed<00:01:15.010> using<00:01:15.250> his

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
beam but I really enjoyed using his

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.280 
beam but I really enjoyed using his
weapon<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.420> primarily<00:01:16.600> because<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.140> the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
weapon that is primarily because of the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.710 
weapon that is primarily because of the
combination<00:01:17.980> of<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.790> really<00:01:19.120> good<00:01:19.300> medium

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
combination of the really good medium

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.380 
combination of the really good medium
range<00:01:19.960> accuracy<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:20.800> its<00:01:21.310> high<00:01:21.430> fire<00:01:21.760> rate<00:01:21.970> it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
range accuracy and its high fire rate it

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.750 
range accuracy and its high fire rate it
actually<00:01:22.540> has<00:01:22.780> 900<00:01:23.470> runs<00:01:23.680> per<00:01:24.040> minute<00:01:24.340> just<00:01:24.550> as

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
actually has 900 runs per minute just as

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.840 
actually has 900 runs per minute just as
it<00:01:24.910> does<00:01:25.150> in<00:01:25.560> battlefield<00:01:26.560> 4<00:01:26.620> and<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.670> makes

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
it does in battlefield 4 and it makes

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.210 
it does in battlefield 4 and it makes
the<00:01:28.000> aek-971<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.140> second<00:01:29.470> fastest<00:01:29.830> firing

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
the aek-971 the second fastest firing

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.790 
the aek-971 the second fastest firing
assault<00:01:30.700> rifle<00:01:31.210> right<00:01:31.930> behind<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.470> famas

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
assault rifle right behind the famas

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.280 
assault rifle right behind the famas
with<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> thousand<00:01:33.610> rounds<00:01:34.060> per<00:01:34.390> minute<00:01:34.540> so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
with a thousand rounds per minute so

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.930 
with a thousand rounds per minute so
playing<00:01:35.830> with<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.190> weapon<00:01:36.370> in<00:01:36.640> battlefield

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
playing with this weapon in battlefield

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.820 
playing with this weapon in battlefield
4<00:01:37.120> I<00:01:37.360> was<00:01:37.570> kind<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.840> hoping<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:38.260> get<00:01:38.410> that<00:01:38.560> same

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
4 I was kind of hoping to get that same

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.859 
4 I was kind of hoping to get that same
experience<00:01:39.130> as<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.850> had<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> battlefield<00:01:40.479> 3

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
experience as it had a battlefield 3

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.960 
experience as it had a battlefield 3
just<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.290> laser<00:01:41.560> beam<00:01:41.890> Oh<00:01:42.160> people<00:01:42.550> down<00:01:42.760> on

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
just a laser beam Oh people down on

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.940 
just a laser beam Oh people down on
close<00:01:43.180> range<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.780> medium-range<00:01:44.500> dish

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
close range and medium-range dish

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.440 
close range and medium-range dish
because<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.369> culmination<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.090> high<00:01:46.210> fire

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
because the culmination of the high fire

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.420 
because the culmination of the high fire
rate<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.320> very<00:01:47.530> good<00:01:47.770> medium<00:01:48.160> range

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
rate and the very good medium range

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.160 
rate and the very good medium range
accuracy<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.420> would<00:01:49.540> have<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.720> say<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:50.050> it

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
accuracy and I would have to say that it

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.170 
accuracy and I would have to say that it
is<00:01:50.260> not<00:01:50.410> very<00:01:50.680> far<00:01:50.950> off<00:01:51.130> as<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.000> in

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
is not very far off as it was in

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.359 
is not very far off as it was in
battlefield<00:01:52.600> 3<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.900> would<00:01:53.080> have<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.350> say<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
battlefield 3 I would have to say the

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.280 
battlefield 3 I would have to say the
recoil<00:01:54.820> has<00:01:55.030> slightly<00:01:55.270> increased<00:01:56.050> would

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
recoil has slightly increased would

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.930 
recoil has slightly increased would
actually<00:01:56.530> make<00:01:56.650> sense<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.100> me<00:01:57.190> because<00:01:57.340> 900

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
actually make sense to me because 900

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.150 
actually make sense to me because 900
rounds<00:01:58.060> per<00:01:58.270> minute<00:01:58.420> cannot<00:01:59.110> become<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.710> guns

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
rounds per minute cannot become a guns

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.010 
rounds per minute cannot become a guns
feature<00:02:00.430> without<00:02:00.940> there<00:02:01.180> being<00:02:01.210> some<00:02:01.720> sort<00:02:01.750> of

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
feature without there being some sort of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.290 
feature without there being some sort of
penalty<00:02:02.260> on<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.770> gun<00:02:03.400> naturally<00:02:04.030> for

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
penalty on the gun naturally for

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.480 
penalty on the gun naturally for
balancing<00:02:04.720> purposes<00:02:05.259> but<00:02:05.649> this<00:02:05.830> recoil<00:02:06.310> is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
balancing purposes but this recoil is

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850 
balancing purposes but this recoil is
very<00:02:06.759> manageable<00:02:07.390> now<00:02:08.110> let's<00:02:08.289> talk<00:02:08.500> about<00:02:08.649> the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
very manageable now let's talk about the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.410 
very manageable now let's talk about the
stats<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.340> little<00:02:09.550> bit<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.060> weapon<00:02:10.210> has<00:02:10.330> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
stats a little bit this weapon has a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.050 
stats a little bit this weapon has a
maximum<00:02:10.720> damage<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.290> 25<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.770> drops<00:02:12.220> off<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.580> 18

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
maximum damage of 25 and drops off to 18

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.540 
maximum damage of 25 and drops off to 18

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and around 60 meters that will mean you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.000 
and around 60 meters that will mean you
will<00:02:15.700> need<00:02:16.000> between<00:02:16.420> four<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.780> six<00:02:17.020> shots<00:02:17.350> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
will need between four and six shots to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.710 
will need between four and six shots to
drop<00:02:18.190> an<00:02:18.370> enemy<00:02:18.640> something<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.420> i<00:02:19.450> found

actually<00:02:33.790> hit<00:02:34.090> your<00:02:34.240> target<00:02:34.660> now<00:02:35.200> let's<00:02:35.350> talk

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
actually hit your target now let's talk

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.230 
actually hit your target now let's talk
about<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.890> attachments<00:02:36.580> starting<00:02:36.940> off<00:02:37.030> with

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
about the attachments starting off with

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.510 
about the attachments starting off with
the<00:02:37.360> optics<00:02:37.810> my<00:02:38.200> preference<00:02:38.740> definitely<00:02:39.310> goes

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
the optics my preference definitely goes

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.430 
the optics my preference definitely goes
to<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.819> coyote<00:02:40.150> red<00:02:40.360> dot<00:02:40.540> sight<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.140> because

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
to the coyote red dot sight just because

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.530 
to the coyote red dot sight just because
it<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.860> easiest<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.430> use<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:42.850> battlefield<00:02:43.210> 4

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
it is the easiest to use a battlefield 4

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.180 
it is the easiest to use a battlefield 4
at<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.720> moment<00:02:44.110> unfortunately<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.160> a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
at the moment unfortunately this is a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.010 
at the moment unfortunately this is a
battle<00:02:45.580> pack<00:02:45.760> unlocked<00:02:46.120> item<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.900> you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
battle pack unlocked item so if you

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.180 
battle pack unlocked item so if you
haven't<00:02:47.200> been<00:02:47.410> fortunate<00:02:47.710> enough<00:02:48.010> to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
haven't been fortunate enough to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.920 
haven't been fortunate enough to
actually<00:02:48.460> unlock<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.030> coyote<00:02:49.300> or<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.480> downside

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
actually unlock the coyote or a downside

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.600 
actually unlock the coyote or a downside
I<00:02:50.170> would<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.830> say<00:02:50.860> go<00:02:51.160> with<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> Cobra

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
I would have to say go with the Cobra

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.400 
I would have to say go with the Cobra
red<00:02:51.880> dot<00:02:52.060> sight<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.750> actually<00:02:52.870> reminds<00:02:53.260> me<00:02:53.380> a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
red dot sight it actually reminds me a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.750 
red dot sight it actually reminds me a
lot<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.830> Cobra<00:02:54.130> dot<00:02:54.370> sight<00:02:54.610> in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
lot of the Cobra dot sight in

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.190 
lot of the Cobra dot sight in
battlefield<00:02:55.180> 3<00:02:55.240> which<00:02:55.660> were<00:02:55.780> actually<00:02:56.080> my

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
battlefield 3 which were actually my

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.290 
battlefield 3 which were actually my
favorite<00:02:56.470> objects<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.190> use<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.700> assault

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
favorite objects to use on assault

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.940 
favorite objects to use on assault
rifles<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.050> if<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.380> would<00:02:59.530> have<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.770> choose

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
rifles but if I would have to choose

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.410 
rifles but if I would have to choose
between<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.340> Cobra<00:03:00.610> red<00:03:00.760> dot<00:03:00.910> sight<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
between the Cobra red dot sight and the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.210 
between the Cobra red dot sight and the
coyote<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.959> would<00:03:02.170> say<00:03:02.350> go<00:03:02.650> with<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> coyote

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
coyote I would say go with the coyote

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.070 
coyote I would say go with the coyote
side<00:03:03.520> as<00:03:03.730> an<00:03:04.090> accessory<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.540> would<00:03:04.750> use<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
side as an accessory I would use the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.720 
side as an accessory I would use the
laser<00:03:05.260> sight<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:05.950> has<00:03:06.130> everything<00:03:06.520> to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
laser sight and this has everything to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.160 
laser sight and this has everything to
do<00:03:06.940> with<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.209> high<00:03:07.330> fire<00:03:07.630> rate<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:08.020> this

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
do with the high fire rate on this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.900 
do with the high fire rate on this
weapon<00:03:08.350> whenever<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.100> come<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.460> and<00:03:09.580> up<00:03:09.670> close

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
weapon whenever I come in and up close

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.360

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
and personal 1v1 situation with an SMG i

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.150 
and personal 1v1 situation with an SMG i
find<00:03:12.700> myself

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
find myself

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.280 
find myself
winning<00:03:13.700> those<00:03:13.850> fights<00:03:14.090> rather<00:03:14.720> than<00:03:14.900> losing

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
winning those fights rather than losing

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.660 
winning those fights rather than losing
them<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.650> if<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:15.950> want<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.220> clear<00:03:16.400> small

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
them and if you want to clear small

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.190 
them and if you want to clear small
corridors<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.210> small<00:03:17.510> rooms<00:03:17.540> i<00:03:17.930> think<00:03:18.110> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
corridors for small rooms i think the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.630 
corridors for small rooms i think the
laser<00:03:18.410> sight<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.830> definitely<00:03:19.280> going<00:03:19.490> to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
laser sight is definitely going to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.970 
laser sight is definitely going to
benefit<00:03:20.090> their<00:03:20.360> i<00:03:20.540> use<00:03:21.020> hipfire<00:03:21.440> all<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.770> time

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
benefit their i use hipfire all the time

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.590 
benefit their i use hipfire all the time
and<00:03:22.130> have<00:03:22.250> found<00:03:22.460> that<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.790> very<00:03:23.150> effective

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
and have found that it is very effective

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.150 
and have found that it is very effective
when<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.290> make<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.470> split-second

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
when you have to make a split-second

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.100 
when you have to make a split-second
reaction<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:26.330> barrel<00:03:26.600> attachment<00:03:26.660> i

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
reaction it's a barrel attachment i

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.600 
reaction it's a barrel attachment i
would<00:03:27.260> use<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.620> muzzle<00:03:28.010> brake<00:03:28.220> in

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
would use the muzzle brake in

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.070 
would use the muzzle brake in
combination<00:03:29.090> with<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.240> stubby<00:03:29.510> grip<00:03:29.600> i<00:03:29.870> think

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
combination with the stubby grip i think

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.020 
combination with the stubby grip i think
this<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.350> currently<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.860> best<00:03:30.890> way<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.280> go<00:03:31.550> on

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
this is currently the best way to go on

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.700 
this is currently the best way to go on
controlling<00:03:32.480> your<00:03:32.660> recoil<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.320> assault

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
controlling your recoil on assault

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.980 
controlling your recoil on assault
rifles<00:03:34.160> however<00:03:34.850> i<00:03:34.940> would<00:03:35.090> also<00:03:35.270> make<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.660> small

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
rifles however i would also make a small

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.900 
rifles however i would also make a small
suggestion<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:37.130> make<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.460> load<00:03:37.730> out<00:03:37.760> a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
suggestion to make this load out a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.940 
suggestion to make this load out a
little<00:03:38.060> bit<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:38.360> fun<00:03:38.690> early<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.470> unlocked

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
little bit more fun early on I unlocked

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.740 
little bit more fun early on I unlocked
a<00:03:40.070> suppressor<00:03:40.550> for<00:03:40.700> her<00:03:40.820> battle<00:03:41.180> pack<00:03:41.360> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
a suppressor for her battle pack and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.510 
a suppressor for her battle pack and
using<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.140> suppressor<00:03:42.620> instead<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.220> muzzle

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
using a suppressor instead of the muzzle

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.010 
using a suppressor instead of the muzzle
brake<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:43.970> was<00:03:44.150> actually<00:03:44.270> having<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.660> lot<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.810> fun

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
brake I was actually having a lot of fun

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.960 
brake I was actually having a lot of fun
going<00:03:45.200> behind<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.710> enemy<00:03:45.890> lines<00:03:46.280> getting

going behind the enemy lines getting

going behind the enemy lines getting
close<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.420> enemy<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.690> actually<00:03:48.140> using

get suppressed do not appear on the
radar<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.090> found<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.480> be<00:03:50.510> very

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
radar and I found it to be very

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.690 
radar and I found it to be very
effective<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.530> really<00:03:51.890> like<00:03:52.010> this<00:03:52.190> weapon<00:03:52.580> I

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
effective I really like this weapon I

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.340 
effective I really like this weapon I
think<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.240> one<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.450> my<00:03:53.630> favorite<00:03:54.050> assault
