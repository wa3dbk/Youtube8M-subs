00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.650
 Now we're going to learn how to do it. 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:20.669
 Folding sheets of paper designs is 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:24.270
 formats is 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 and 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:28.130
 all of them confirming the size a4 to 20 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:32.340
 that can be archived where the legend 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.710
 or her to appear in front and the margin 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.030
 left free for women to fix 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.030
 or drill 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.909
 let's start with a look at 3 a3 sheet 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.409
 has a margin of 25 millimeters in 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.390
 left and 7mm too much lasmar 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.150
 margins 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.549
 the first thing to do is to mark the 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.549
 185 mm from the margin 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:07.049
 right and fold back so with 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.380
 crease 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:17.460
 we should lean on the left bank and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.400
 so formatting a4 may already 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.400
 file the sheet 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.030
 It was now 2 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.910
 sheet two have the same images was the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.659
 35 millimeters in this farm 7 millimeters 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:40.560
 national kills the first thing to do 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:47.990
 is to ask for 65mm below the margin 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:53.540
 right and fold back after medici 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:02:00.050
 96 mm folds forward 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:03.810
 then again 96mm behind 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:10.530
 with a crease shape should lean on 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:15.300
 left margin in order to form the 4 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.240
 we should fold 297 mm 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.320
 and this arm back so that 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:30.130
 to activate we should double again and 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:39.340
 form the ear that average 105 mm 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:49.180
 and doubling up to form public accepted 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:52.270
 names now format the format 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.050
 increase more than 2 1 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
 to 3 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.520
 it still has 25 millimeters 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.340
 left margin but more images have ten 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:08.459
 minutes because it is a larger format 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:14.800
 the first thing to do is double 185 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:19.769
 forth with the other players then 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:24.610
 35mm forward 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:30.010
 after that should double 130 girl 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.350
 other treaties and after this that 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.110
 greater link 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.110
 we want to touch the left bank 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:46.750
 to convert to a4 format 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:50.290
 we should double back 297 mm 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.720
 You're going to split the sheet half to power. 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:59.290
 file it correctly 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:04.150
 we should make ear that is measure 105 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.420
 mm formed in the river make a 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.420
 third 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.150
 so we have been told to go 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.120
 the format to the format 10 have the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.120
 same images as the 1 25m format 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.770
 level of your left image 10 liters 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.010
 in more images 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:39.860
 the same process seventy-five girls 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:44.710
 for the first law and then between the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.710
 our 75 minutes ahead 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:56.240
 then 85 minutes back and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.460
 front 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:10.130
 after that should double 119.5 girl 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:15.310
 behind and with the richest in Brazil 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.310
 so that it touches the left margin 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.710
 But how are we to turn into a 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.780
 an a4 format 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.860
 we should double inmetro 247 in 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.910
 front 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.830
 from the top and 297 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.830
 millimeters back 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:47.419
 to transform the ear so that it 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:50.840
 can activate we should double 105 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:06:00.979
 millimeters inside and use the latter 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:03.610
 link and how to inform the format 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.610
 0
