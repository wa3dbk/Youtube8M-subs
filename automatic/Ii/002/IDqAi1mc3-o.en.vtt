00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello people and welcome to save 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 again french and fox and have today 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.690
 We started a few smartphone for 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.400
 you think of them in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.340
 things price performance actually 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 a very good overall package 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.710
 price / performance that it already the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 right thing the right transfer 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 because this is a sequence 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.380
 the price is quite simply conditional 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.309
 that means the first smartphone is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.989
 not the best 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.840
 and that ultimately the worst 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 of course not the same way today 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.480
 it's just that we have a few 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 have searched for interesting smartphones 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.250
 and we show you the city now 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 with the motorola moto gp let's go 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
 motto go the second generation comes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 with a really good 5 inch big 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.090
 HDIP display of an 8 megapixel camera 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 and stereo front speakers themselves 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.820
 actually see or hear 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.309
 can let 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 thanks to its soft touch surface and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.820
 a pleasantly rounded back 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.470
 it is very good in the hand and also 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 the other processing can be 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.750
 It really was not possible to be seen here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.610
 saved up 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.470
 as a small feature should some 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.180
 nor the nano coating mention the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.729
 the slogan g2 before water splashes 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.590
 light rain or an undisputed 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 To protect glass, for example 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.159
 You can go swimming with it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.200
 no fall and you should submerge 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 but not in the rain you need 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.659
 For example, there are no big ones 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 to worry 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 the great strength of the motorola moto g2 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 But it is the performance that goes with it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.250
 the most recent and unchanged 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 version of googles operating system 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 android 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.570
 He regularly and quickly holds the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 latest updates and thus you are 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 software technology actually always 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.210
 pretty well supplied also positive 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
 to mention would be the possibility two 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.680
 to insert two sim cards at once 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.540
 so you can for example a card private and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 to use the other for the profession or 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.409
 but you have a card with telephony 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 and one with internet flatrate that is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.950
 weakening in practical terms, we see here 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 especially with the camera 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.909
 results really only average 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.590
 Who are the standard design so 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.270
 does not like the black has the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.680
 possibility the g2 by colorful 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.670
 Replacement cover to your own taste 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.049
 adjust 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.580
 they are not in the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.539
 scope of delivery included and you have to 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.030
 the separate one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.219
 oh buy colorful change covers 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.599
 the way to colorful smartphones not far 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.000
 and with that we already have the 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.030
 perfect transfer to microsoft and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.849
 the lumia 640 with a non-binding 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.220
 price of 180 euros it is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.620
 just under 20 euros cheaper than the motogp 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.780
 deal with windows phone 8.1, we have a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670
 completely different operating system 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.739
 It is much easier to understand 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 and to serve it but it offers 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.269
 also less change than smartphones 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.250
 with android here, everything plays out 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.989
 two sides from which you the first 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.879
 arrange page according to your wishes 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.069
 On the second page you can find 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.930
 because in alphabetical order all 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.480
 apps installed on the phone 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.310
 have windows phone is known 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.260
 that it does not need high end hardware 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.500
 to run smoothly and so it is 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.299
 at the 640 back country or short 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 commemorative seconds are rare and so 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.379
 afford the qualcomm snapdragon 400 quad 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.099
 core processor and the one gigabyte 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.569
 big memory good job 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.060
 Microsoft is installing a decent 5 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.220
 inch big ips lcd display one 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 average 8 megapixel camera and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.120
 the interchangeable two 1500's 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.540
 milli-hours of strong battery supplies 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.729
 you stream for one to one and a half days 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.609
 a special feature of the lumia 640 is the 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:28.019
 free worldwide offline navigation 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.449
 you also without internet connection 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.250
 to the destination leads so invite you 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.810
 simply the desired cards before the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.699
 Go down and then you can 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.590
 plunge directly into adventure 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.750
 You also receive for one 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.250
 free office package with how to 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.109
 example word or excel files 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.569
 can create and edit completely 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.120
 easy and direct from the smartphone too 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.549
 there is the memory of 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.069
 only about 3 gb are available 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.229
 and without micro sd card is there 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.209
 it's going to blow out so it would be nice 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.989
 if one had been included 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.569
 would have been 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.500
 otherwise, the camera could out freer 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.510
 deliver results 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.799
 Overall, it can be said that one 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.930
 for the price a decent 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.349
 Total package receives and the camera is not 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.060
 but it's just okay 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.069
 we come to the third device and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.750
 at the same time also the penultimate of this 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.570
 presentation rounds namely the motorola 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.670
 oe24 will be surprised now why 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.530
 here again a motorola turns up but 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.020
 this is simply because of the engine or 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.820
 builds really decent stuff and that 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.590
 throws on the market at fair prices 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.680
 and so it is the engine of the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.630
 second generation with just 130 euros 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.180
 ovp we will continue here 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.950
 Direction 100 euro but really remember 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.140
 You do not even do it that way 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.100
 It is really what I am 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.990
 personally as good 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.300
 entry-level smartphone would define 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.330
 it's small but offers something of everything 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.900
 is in no area perfect the 4 5 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.180
 inch large ips lcd display with 960 x 540 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.070
 pixeln it is perfectly alright the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.050
 View angles are quite good and so are the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.730
 brightness can really be seen 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.620
 make the camera with their five 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.690
 Megapixel still quite decent pictures 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.040
 but unfortunately here is the lightning and 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.970
 so she is in the dark, so to speak 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.650
 unusable 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.150
 the performance is real 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.040
 very neat that one knows so yes 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.080
 actually synonymous of motorola and thanks 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.760
 the qualcomm snapdragon 410 and one 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.740
 gigabytes of memory is there 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.419
 here very rarely wait times before 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.669
 but no jerks the one 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.210
 somehow the annoying room for the price 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.040
 is it really good the batteries with 2390th 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.419
 milliseconds and delivers 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.310
 for this area, too 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.010
 extraordinary more pleasant terms 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.470
 So 1 5 to two days are good here and 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.669
 gladly once in it 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.560
 Of course we can not do this video 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.080
 without even a smartphone for 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.700
 to present under 100 euros and 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.070
 we opted for the wiko 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.930
 lenny though the manufacturer to the 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.790
 owned by someone less known as one 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.470
 decent amount of smartphones and that 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.270
 The main reason is that you for the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.150
 in each case quite a reasonable price 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.710
 nice package gets the wiko lenny comes 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.010
 for example, with a 5 inch tall 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.510
 display in s / w vga resolution and it is 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.350
 really what you get for the price 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.290
 can expect 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.650
 ok until enough behind this 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.860
 complicated shortcuts hide 854 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.260
 x 480 pixels and for 5 inches it is 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.880
 Quite little is added to that the display 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.570
 really strong reflects and the 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.120
 perspective 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.250
 well they are not really good 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.320
 if you then but the price of order 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.080
 the 90 euros look then that is again 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.210
 perfectly okay, not much time and time 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.570
 gets just what represented so 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.340
 leaves 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.260
 which can be 5 megapixels 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.699
 suitable for simple snapshots 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.919
 and for a moment or two 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:37.620
 hold on and the performance is 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.540
 thanks to the untouched android surface 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.270
 decent power gets it like coal 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.540
 never dual-clocked by a 1 3 ghz 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.850
 core processor and 512 megabytes of RAM 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.500
 As I said the culprits especially the price 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.010
 and for that the package is really in 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.190
 order 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.970
 Otherwise, the lenny impresses with colorful 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.010
 color combinations and the possibility 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.580
 equal to two sim cards at the same time 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.940
 use 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.860
 yes that was our first customer beginner 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.810
 smartphones why first round the whole 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.100
 should come more often now, of course 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.360
 not already next month 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.130
 but as I said it always comes 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.950
 again new smartphones and there are up 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.690
