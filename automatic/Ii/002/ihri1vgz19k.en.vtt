00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 you have craftsmen and apprentices are after 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.540
 it all depends on the teacher 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.250
 hairstyle that oddly costs these 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.150
 skate creation traders has only one 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.179
 tattoo vision 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.650
 I got trained by himself so 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.730
 at 15 years old I started I'm at 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.260
 start to find some small 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.240
 formations but it was a bit of a bit 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 difficult at the time the late sales 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 were fewer tankards so I started 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.199
 all of this and suddenly between today a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.960
 young person who wants to launch he has the choice 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 between 20.1 m in a workshop that will 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 train you to do a private school 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.960
 the idea that it's still quite expensive 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.840
 the idea of a training with can be a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 it does for those who want it three 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 month I know to pessah anyway 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 particular I think we risk getting 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.559
 find in finally do a school 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 with 30 students 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.910
 that's going to come out every year or 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500
 every two years aristin all saturated 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.300
 water 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.770
 the market you see how that can 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.600
 arrive in the middle of roof graphics 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.340
 where about twenty years ago the guy 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.980
 was coming out of the schools he had coffee all 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.059
 it was good after that in voice and in 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.890
 calling unemployment now or 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.040
 things like that that's the risk 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.510
 which is a profession that is in vogue in 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.130
 supply level of demand is ok 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.900
 is rather balanced now I have 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.600
 afraid that if we end up at all of a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.920
 blow it remains a bit of bach for them 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.000
 guys who are up no do you see but 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.290
 more for those little guys who are going 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.240
 get out of school that might be a little 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.160
 galls here after if I have to 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 Advisor 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.050
 to young people an approach is this 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.850
 would be to be trained live by a 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.170
 pro and of course even though I have 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 started all this frankly it's 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.040
 not the good is not the good 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.940
 strategy you waste time you lose 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.650
 that can go much faster 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.870
 and it can be much more serious 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.680
 for just dropped on the right 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.350
 big because there are plenty of them 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.190
 lrba insert course of course that's it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.619
 that's the risk 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.000
 that's the risk after it's a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.250
 history years and that's the life what are you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.310
 seek you find human relationships 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.899
 it's always like that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.420
 be it in the heap everywhere 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.950
 Besides, you you you consider yourself 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.149
 an artist as a craftsman me I am 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.369
 consider as an artisan 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.790
 here I have a job I know 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.320
 to do behind is not just to create 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.140
 machine settings a whole aspect 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.700
 technique that I like to put put 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.959
 forward also because you have beautiful 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 have the best ideas in the world for 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.310
 one to help you sense if you do not know to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.800
 lay them your cards and needles 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 solder his needles finally and then a whole 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.330
 history also behind so that's 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.290
 for that me the artisans side I like them 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.620
 well here is an artist artist that's 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.330
 always the legitimacy of these two you 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.790
 not created actually an artist will do 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.410
 a canvas we are going to explode in a in 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.630
 a peace gallery that wants to take a 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.890
 risk taking all that works us 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.120
 a little on order anyway if it takes 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.700
 we have shops 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.540
 I think we have to look at the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 reality in front 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.320
 and then it's good if you lack it is 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.260
 a status already to start that will be 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.140
 well after we'll see for the rest what 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.200
 what is it here artists craftsmen the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 difference and minimal it's just 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.530
 unfortunately I think 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.660
 in many cases it's more 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.390
 a tax reasons 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.870
 that drives people to focus on the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.850
 artist side if I do you do the reverse the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 things like blame and craftsmen 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.110
 and artists side but here but me 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.670
 I would like a status because and 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.250
 can just have apprentices from 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.030
 square way and then is too familiar you 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.590
 do not see, we have one of the oldest jobs 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.650
 of the world and if we are ten still not 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.820
 what is this particular but good 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.820
 hope it changes 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.540
 craftsmen and apprentices after everything 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.070
 depends i find it good teacher 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.930
 perfect but that costs virtuously 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.280
 precisely these creation traders who 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.280
 attack a single vision of the tattoo
