00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
been about a solid month I think since

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.220 
been about a solid month I think since
I've<00:00:10.230> gotten<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.590> Zen<00:00:11.330> it's<00:00:12.330> drastically

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I've gotten the Zen it's drastically

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.770 
I've gotten the Zen it's drastically
improved<00:00:13.559> my<00:00:13.710> game<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:15.120> know<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.450> keep<00:00:15.599> up

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
improved my game I you know can keep up

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
improved my game I you know can keep up
I<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.139> compete<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.830> actually<00:00:17.100> aim<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.550> and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
I can compete I can actually aim now and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120 
I can compete I can actually aim now and
things<00:00:18.449> are<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.690> pretty<00:00:18.810> well<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.949> if<00:00:20.039> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
things are going pretty well so if you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.279 
things are going pretty well so if you
watch<00:00:20.279> my<00:00:20.310> other<00:00:20.670> video<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
watch my other video I think I was at a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.970 
watch my other video I think I was at a
point<00:00:22.560> eight<00:00:22.859> kdr<00:00:23.609> i'm<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> 1.1<00:00:25.380> overall

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
point eight kdr i'm up to a 1.1 overall

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.849 
point eight kdr i'm up to a 1.1 overall
now<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.960> accurate<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.650> my

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
now that's not really accurate on my

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.820 
now that's not really accurate on my
overall<00:00:29.519> kdr<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> reason<00:00:30.900> why<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.320> i<00:00:31.619> had

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
overall kdr and the reason why is i had

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
overall kdr and the reason why is i had
almost<00:00:32.040> 10,000<00:00:32.730> kills<00:00:32.969> prior<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> getting<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
almost 10,000 kills prior to getting the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660 
almost 10,000 kills prior to getting the
zen<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> take<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.460> least

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
zen so it's going to take at least

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.440 
zen so it's going to take at least
another<00:00:35.880> 10<00:00:36.469> probably<00:00:37.469> more<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.010> 20<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
another 10 probably more like 20 to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.010 
another 10 probably more like 20 to
30,000<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:40.070> completely<00:00:41.070> round<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
30,000 to completely round out and the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.770 
30,000 to completely round out and the
the<00:00:43.680> outliers<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:45.360> those<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.600> know

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the outliers for those of you know

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.889 
the outliers for those of you know
anything<00:00:46.020> about<00:00:46.170> statistics<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.899> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
anything about statistics if you you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
anything about statistics if you you
have<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.230> enough<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.800> base<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.879> new

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
have to have enough of a base on the new

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
have to have enough of a base on the new
system<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.750> less<00:00:51.899> than<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.559> get

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
system more or less than you know get

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.319 
system more or less than you know get
rid<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> old<00:00:53.039> system<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
rid of the old system so it's going to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.700 
rid of the old system so it's going to
take<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.480> little<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.140> old<00:00:55.289> system<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
take a little bit for that old system to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.569 
take a little bit for that old system to
get<00:00:55.829> knocked<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.230> but<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.129> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
get knocked out so but one thing that is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.510 
get knocked out so but one thing that is
pretty<00:01:00.000> accurate<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.840> free<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.620> stats

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
pretty accurate is my free for all stats

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.549 
pretty accurate is my free for all stats

my mind you know but we'll see we'll see
so<00:03:03.260> um<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.580> only<00:03:04.819> drawback<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.599> playing<00:03:05.840> FFA

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
so um the only drawback for playing FFA

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.440 
so um the only drawback for playing FFA
as<00:03:06.620> my<00:03:06.799> game<00:03:07.220> mode<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:09.910> it's<00:03:10.910> not<00:03:11.090> really<00:03:11.299> a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
as my game mode is the it's not really a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.570 
as my game mode is the it's not really a
MOAB<00:03:11.870> conducive<00:03:12.590> environment<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
MOAB conducive environment and the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.430 
MOAB conducive environment and the
reason<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.880> say<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.360> there<00:03:15.049> are<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.230> lot<00:03:15.410> of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
reason I say that is there are a lot of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.259 
reason I say that is there are a lot of
campers<00:03:15.859> because<00:03:16.640> there's<00:03:16.820> folks<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.239> think

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
campers because there's folks that think

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.550 
campers because there's folks that think

that<00:03:23.450> way<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.650> usually<00:03:24.859> works<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.400> way

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
that way but it usually works that way

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.660
