that's<00:00:10.290> right<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.710> know<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:10.950> figured<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
that's right you know we figured out a

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.640 
that's right you know we figured out a
way<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> make<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.690> two<00:00:12.809> fastest<00:00:13.230> appliances

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
way to make the two fastest appliances

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.530 
way to make the two fastest appliances
work<00:00:13.860> together<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.670> pressure<00:00:15.269> cooker

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
work together right a pressure cooker

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.939 
work together right a pressure cooker
and<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.170> microwave

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
and a microwave

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
so the microwaves kind of get the party

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
so the microwaves kind of get the party
started<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:20.220> fast<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:21.180> everybody

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
started really fast because everybody

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.210 
started really fast because everybody
knows<00:00:21.660> how<00:00:21.810> powerful<00:00:22.199> microwaves<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.740> the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
wings we can do in 12 minutes in the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.280 
wings we can do in 12 minutes in the
microwave<00:03:46.250> pressure<00:03:46.700> as<00:03:47.060> well<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.660> these

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
microwave pressure as well and these

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.460 
microwave pressure as well and these
wings<00:03:48.650> are<00:03:48.920> gonna<00:03:48.980> come<00:03:49.250> out<00:03:49.370> tasting<00:03:50.270> amazing

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
wings are gonna come out tasting amazing

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.890 
wings are gonna come out tasting amazing
now<00:03:51.470> when<00:03:52.090> when<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.120> talk<00:03:53.510> about<00:03:53.660> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
now when when I talk about the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.600 
now when when I talk about the
microwaves<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.980> pressure<00:03:55.220> cooker

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
microwaves and the pressure cooker

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.580 
microwaves and the pressure cooker
working<00:03:55.940> together<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> great<00:03:57.170> little

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
working together we have a great little

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.320 
working together we have a great little
animation<00:03:58.220> on<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.550> I'm<00:03:58.730> not<00:03:58.880> sure<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.210> they

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
animation on that I'm not sure if they

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.360 
animation on that I'm not sure if they
can<00:03:59.480> find<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.840> for<00:04:00.050> me<00:04:00.200> yeah<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:00.770> I'd<00:04:00.890> love<00:04:01.160> to

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
can find it for me yeah but I'd love to

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.790 
can find it for me yeah but I'd love to
show<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.820> it<00:04:02.090> was<00:04:02.210> it<00:04:02.840> kind<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.140> puts<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.710> in

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
show that it was it kind of puts it in

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.650 
show that it was it kind of puts it in
perspective<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.760> here's<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.000> regular<00:04:05.210> pressure

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
perspective so here's a regular pressure

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.390 
perspective so here's a regular pressure
cooker<00:04:06.050> right<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.590> could<00:04:06.770> never<00:04:06.980> get<00:04:07.250> that

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
cooker right you could never get that

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.710 
cooker right you could never get that
thing<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.670> work<00:04:07.820> in<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.000> microwave<00:04:08.360> before

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
thing to work in a microwave before

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.290 
thing to work in a microwave before
until<00:04:08.990> now<00:04:09.050> so<00:04:09.950> now<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.190> microwave<00:04:10.790> gets<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
until now so now the microwave gets the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.060 
until now so now the microwave gets the
party<00:04:11.630> started<00:04:11.660> gets<00:04:12.080> things<00:04:12.260> hot<00:04:12.500> real<00:04:12.740> fast

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
party started gets things hot real fast

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.010 
party started gets things hot real fast
so<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:13.880> don't<00:04:13.910> have<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.240> wait<00:04:14.480> for<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.900> come

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
so you don't have to wait for it to come

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.630 
so you don't have to wait for it to come
up<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.290> pressure<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.740> start<00:04:15.950> timeing<00:04:16.280> and

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
up to pressure to start timeing and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.220 
up to pressure to start timeing and
that's<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.390> big<00:04:17.540> difference<00:04:17.570> between<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
that's the big difference between a

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.900 
that's the big difference between a
microwave<00:04:18.710> pressure<00:04:18.979> cooker<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.460> say<00:04:19.790> an

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
microwave pressure cooker and say an

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.789 
microwave pressure cooker and say an
electric<00:04:20.330> or<00:04:20.450> stovetop<00:04:21.049> pressure<00:04:21.380> cooker

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
electric or stovetop pressure cooker

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.590 
electric or stovetop pressure cooker
there's<00:04:22.280> no<00:04:22.490> need<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.729> wait<00:04:23.120> for<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.450> come

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
there's no need to wait for it to come

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.100 
there's no need to wait for it to come
to<00:04:23.720> pressures

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
to pressures

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.070 
to pressures
so<00:04:24.199> when<00:04:24.650> we<00:04:24.770> say<00:04:24.949> 20<00:04:25.370> minutes<00:04:25.520> it's<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.330> real<00:04:26.659> 20

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
so when we say 20 minutes it's a real 20

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.450 
so when we say 20 minutes it's a real 20
minutes<00:04:27.349> at<00:04:27.469> 20<00:04:27.680> minutes<00:04:27.919> from<00:04:28.009> the<00:04:28.159> time<00:04:28.310> you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
minutes at 20 minutes from the time you

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.249 
minutes at 20 minutes from the time you
get<00:04:28.550> 20<00:04:28.849> minutes<00:04:28.969> right<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.539> start<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:30.199> don't

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
get 20 minutes right to start you don't

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.589 
get 20 minutes right to start you don't
have<00:04:30.439> to<00:04:30.560> wait<00:04:30.889> for<00:04:31.189> the<00:04:31.520> microwaves<00:04:32.060> I'm

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
have to wait for the microwaves I'm

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:33.999 
have to wait for the microwaves I'm
sorry<00:04:32.810> for<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.020> pressure<00:04:33.199> cooker<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.560> get<00:04:33.860> the

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
sorry for the pressure cooker to get the

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.800 
sorry for the pressure cooker to get the
pressure<00:04:34.219> before<00:04:34.789> you<00:04:35.000> start<00:04:35.300> counting<00:04:35.569> down

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
pressure before you start counting down

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.230 
pressure before you start counting down
okay<00:04:36.379> and<00:04:36.500> that's<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:37.039> great<00:04:37.400> thing<00:04:37.699> so<00:04:37.939> show<00:04:38.120> us
