00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.959
 I will need this master class 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:16.630
 carcass bunny is a bead 3 millimeters 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.230
 you can take any other glass 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.880
 insert for your model 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.640
 felt-tip pen which we will mark eyes 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.349
 in my case this is a disappearing pencil 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.619
 for cutting but you can use 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:35.080
 ordinary plain pencil strings 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:38.500
 we will be utyagin they hare skin 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.720
 and two needles one small other 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.910
 big both desirable with big eye 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.920
 so you have to insert play 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.000
 several times and so after i 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.060
 outlined eyes 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.190
 I would like to show you right away that 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.710
 you should end up with one 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.980
 my eye is already pulled 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.480
 there is only one place yet 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.600
 I lift that we are going to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 form on the other side for this 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 we need to take a little needle 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:19.130
 without knot 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.130
 at the ends of a smile that's scheduling lawyers 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.710
 pull the thread to leave the tip 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.009
 for power against teaching to the end 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.350
 standard for giving birth to a needle again this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.030
 same meat 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.850
 thread and twist around a few needles 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.800
 times and tighten the knot ie we 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.619
 held in place by Ander idea 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.039
 must hoods 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.780
 recess for galaxy now for us 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.530
 Need to change needle 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.650
 it is necessary in order 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.700
 did not forgive myself the process of utyazhki 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.259
 a small slide of course utyazhek 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 pulling too is possible but it is inconvenient 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.960
 Alaska I recorded in search 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.210
 arguments in the head hares 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.899
 for this i take a big fat race 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.759
 which is certainly not lost there 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.830
 passing my food straight into that place 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.890
 pierces where it should be stroked and 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.550
 to lower it comes second 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.830
 by the side 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.360
 somewhere closed disappears here very 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.970
 important moment when you pull out 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.739
 the head from the hatch is not you very tight and you 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.980
 should now like to expand 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:33.500
 place of exit of this science in order to 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.480
 I will precisely write down the hole in the opposite 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.069
 direction 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.530
 This is necessary so that the fabric with 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.110
 this side was not captured by you if 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.300
 you grab it then you will 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.270
 utyazh of this from this country is not 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.860
 will find the eyes are needed only on the face avz 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.030
 links they are completely unnecessary 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.650
 so we stretch the public through the same 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:03.140
 hole and bring it together where should 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:07.360
 be eye with the back of our head we get 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.330
 the next picture is all this saw cabinet 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.490
 the eye is pulled down in the back of the head there are no 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.590
 defects are small holes which 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.840
 stay on the same good you so here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.320
 finish the fleece fleece it at all 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.690
 imperceptibly on not exactly the same it can 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.420
 the strings were tweaked with just a fingernail or 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.420
 Needle the same you so distribute on 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.150
 places and in general they are not 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.560
 instantly now a big boom 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.450
 it is too heavy here so not again 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.360
 back to the little one 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.110
 as a hoax to perpetuate 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.110
 utyazhka 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.670
 utya secured purchase she lived . 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.720
 successful 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.360
 voices and straight on usually close up 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.520
 fixed not very deep to 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.700
 I do not strongly deform the carcass if 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.730
 you need very deep wade very for 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.800
 he even needs to do the same 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.970
 procedure several times and take a string 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.670
 into one of 2 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.480
 or take a thread more tightly for example 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.090
 for jeans 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.010
 but you must bear in mind that more 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.160
 leave a thick thread, respectively, and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.030
 here are more dense nodes and therefore 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.600
 bead must match 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.680
 subsequent size and so now we 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.330
 do the following again stretch 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.880
 we spend so needle to place 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.330
 eye formation 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.600
 take the thread that comes out of 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.870
 hare content can exactly as much 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.980
 how much is it needed to find 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:56.260
 drove and winding and wheelbarrow around and this 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.770
 Needles continue to hold the bundle with your finger 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.420
 here fingers do not let go and pull out 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.480
 neatly unhurried 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:11.400
 You should have a district here 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.240
 with a bundle for strong, respectively 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.180
 the apple is so small 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.950
 notching extra threads that we have 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.870
 it remains that is the thread that we 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.150
 just fixed and thread which 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.050
 left after the first tack we 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.940
 we remove with scissors 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.840
 in the next step, I'll show you how to 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.840
 sew on beads
