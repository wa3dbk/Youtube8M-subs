here's<00:00:02.070> something<00:00:02.610> that<00:00:02.910> I<00:00:04.160> see<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.520> little

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
here's something that I see a little

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.880 
here's something that I see a little
more<00:00:05.970> often<00:00:06.210> than<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.840> would<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.799> I

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
more often than I would like to and I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.360 
more often than I would like to and I
have<00:00:08.219> to<00:00:08.490> ask<00:00:08.730> why<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.960> mean<00:00:10.830> let's<00:00:11.099> face<00:00:11.190> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
have to ask why I mean let's face it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.959 
have to ask why I mean let's face it
this<00:00:11.910> screen<00:00:12.330> right<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.260> damaged<00:00:13.980> it's

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
this screen right here is damaged it's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510 
this screen right here is damaged it's
got<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> hole<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.710> rusting<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
got a hole in it and it's rusting and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.250 
got a hole in it and it's rusting and
someone<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:18.000> painted<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.750> don't<00:00:18.990> know<00:00:19.050> how

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
someone has painted it I don't know how

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.519 
someone has painted it I don't know how
many<00:00:19.320> times<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> needs<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.789> replaced

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
many times and it needs to be replaced

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.960 
many times and it needs to be replaced
now<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.949> thing<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.279> need<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> look<00:00:23.730> at

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
now the first thing we need to look at

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.320 
now the first thing we need to look at
is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.359> hole<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.020> screen<00:00:25.730> part<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
is the hole in the screen part of the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.050 
is the hole in the screen part of the
reason<00:00:27.779> why<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.890> screened<00:00:29.519> vents

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
reason why we have screened vents

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.379 
reason why we have screened vents
believe<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.750> or<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.399> to<00:00:32.399> actually<00:00:32.729> keep

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:33.389 
believe it or not is to actually keep

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:36.860 
believe it or not is to actually keep
things<00:00:33.839> out<00:00:34.109> of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.159> building<00:00:35.639> so<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.659> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
things out of the building so if the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.729 
things out of the building so if the
screen<00:00:37.289> is<00:00:37.649> damaged<00:00:38.309> has<00:00:38.639> a<00:00:38.670> nice<00:00:39.350> hole<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.620> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
screen is damaged has a nice hole in it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.829 
screen is damaged has a nice hole in it
like<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.159> one<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.729> it's<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.179> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.719> be

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
like this one here it's not going to be

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.199 
like this one here it's not going to be
doing<00:00:43.199> its<00:00:43.379> job<00:00:43.679> now<00:00:44.010> another<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.519> is<00:00:44.850> you

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:45.209 
doing its job now another thing is you

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.569 
doing its job now another thing is you
can't<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.839> painting<00:00:46.319> over<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.739> screens<00:00:47.159> if

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
can't be painting over the screens if

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.469 
can't be painting over the screens if
you're<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.809> clogging<00:00:49.409> them<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.479> can't

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
you're gonna be clogging them up I can't

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.149 
you're gonna be clogging them up I can't
tell<00:00:51.659> you<00:00:51.780> how<00:00:51.929> many<00:00:52.139> times<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.799> come<00:00:53.039> across

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
tell you how many times I come across

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.629 
tell you how many times I come across
the<00:00:53.549> screen<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.269> been<00:00:54.449> painted<00:00:54.869> and

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
the screen that has been painted and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.160 
the screen that has been painted and
some<00:00:56.639> screens<00:00:56.999> realistically<00:00:57.719> shouldn't<00:00:58.079> be

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
some screens realistically shouldn't be

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
some screens realistically shouldn't be
painted<00:00:58.589> because<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.069> paint<00:00:59.339> will<00:00:59.549> actually

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
painted because the paint will actually

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.859 
painted because the paint will actually
seal<00:01:01.049> most<00:01:01.679> of<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.429> vent<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.209> and<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> course

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
seal most of the vent off and of course

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.440 
seal most of the vent off and of course
then<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> vent<00:01:05.060> now<00:01:06.060> here's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
then you don't have a vent now here's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
then you don't have a vent now here's
the<00:01:06.689> biggest<00:01:06.869> problem<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.859> vent

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the biggest problem I have of this vent

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
the biggest problem I have of this vent
it's<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:09.119> even<00:01:09.450> installed<00:01:09.869> properly<00:01:10.229> someone

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
it's not even installed properly someone

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's not even installed properly someone
the<00:01:12.000> vent<00:01:12.299> before<00:01:13.520> probably<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:15.060> damaged<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the vent before probably got damaged and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.389 
the vent before probably got damaged and
someone<00:01:16.079> just<00:01:16.229> went<00:01:16.409> ahead<00:01:16.469> and<00:01:16.740> replaced<00:01:16.859> it

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
someone just went ahead and replaced it

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.760 
someone just went ahead and replaced it
with<00:01:17.609> this<00:01:18.539> thing<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.590> not

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
with this thing right here and I'm not

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.340 
with this thing right here and I'm not
saying<00:01:20.039> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.399> wrong<00:01:20.640> vent<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.840> am

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
saying this is the wrong vent but I am

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
saying this is the wrong vent but I am
saying<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.579> need<00:01:23.789> to<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.359> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
saying that all you need to do with this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
saying that all you need to do with this
vent<00:01:24.869> since<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.100> installed<00:01:26.670> incorrectly

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
vent since it was installed incorrectly

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
vent since it was installed incorrectly
is<00:01:27.659> pull<00:01:28.109> it<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:30.049> go<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.289> this<00:01:31.469> door

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is pull it off and go down to this door

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
is pull it off and go down to this door
purchase<00:01:32.189> another<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.119> screw<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
purchase another one and just screw it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
purchase another one and just screw it
back<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.979> know<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> ridiculous

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
back on here you know this is ridiculous

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.440 
back on here you know this is ridiculous
but<00:01:37.200> again<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.219> vent<00:01:38.609> right<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.149> wasn't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
but again this vent right here wasn't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
but again this vent right here wasn't
installed<00:01:40.020> properly<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.950> shouldn't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
installed properly because you shouldn't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
installed properly because you shouldn't
see<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> flanges<00:01:42.479> trust<00:01:43.319> me<00:01:43.499> there's<00:01:43.679> plenty

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
see the flanges trust me there's plenty

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.910 
see the flanges trust me there's plenty
of<00:01:44.159> spots<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.509> vent<00:01:45.869> where<00:01:46.170> water<00:01:46.530> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
of spots on this vent where water can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.739 
of spots on this vent where water can
seep<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:49.560> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
seep right in and it's kind of like a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.599 
seep right in and it's kind of like a
double<00:01:51.749> bonus<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.859> opposite<00:01:53.460> direction

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
double bonus in the opposite direction

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.999 
double bonus in the opposite direction
so<00:01:54.090> again<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.990> sometimes<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.740> pays<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
so again this sometimes it pays to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.739 
so again this sometimes it pays to
actually<00:01:56.639> find<00:01:56.939> people<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.600> what

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
actually find people that know what

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually find people that know what
they're<00:01:57.899> doing<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:58.649> you're<00:01:59.479> getting<00:02:00.479> your

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
they're doing when you're getting your

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.429 
they're doing when you're getting your
home<00:02:01.619> repairs<00:02:02.100> done
