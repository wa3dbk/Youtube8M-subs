00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.800 

what<00:00:37.370> can<00:00:37.520> we<00:00:37.580> do<00:00:38.380> beam<00:00:39.380> them<00:00:39.560> aboard<00:00:40.210> um<00:00:41.210> I

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
what can we do beam them aboard um I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.780 
what can we do beam them aboard um I
just<00:00:42.350> don't<00:00:42.890> think<00:00:43.100> there's<00:00:43.310> enough<00:00:43.520> power

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
just don't think there's enough power

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.729 
just don't think there's enough power
for<00:00:43.940> us<00:00:44.239> actually<00:00:44.480> he's<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.870> beam<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.380> let<00:00:45.530> me

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
for us actually he's the beam you let me

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.940 
for us actually he's the beam you let me
worry<00:00:46.010> about<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.460> power<00:00:47.650> insignia<00:00:48.650> sake

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
worry about the power insignia sake

we<00:00:52.730> got<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.270> what<00:00:54.140> what<00:00:54.500> does<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:54.650> sound

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
we got it what what does that sound

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.700 
we got it what what does that sound
goddamn<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.100> get<00:00:58.250> sake<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.090> brown<00:00:59.360> the<00:01:00.199> energy

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
me worry about the power that's not what

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.800 
me worry about the power that's not what
I'm<00:01:16.670> asking<00:01:16.910> god<00:01:17.750> damn<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:22.390> if<00:01:23.390> they<00:01:23.630> are

falling I highly advise we reposition

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.420 
falling I highly advise we reposition
and<00:01:26.390> deploy<00:01:26.750> an<00:01:27.080> antigravity<00:01:27.470> dampener

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
and deploy an antigravity dampener

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.639 
and deploy an antigravity dampener
before<00:01:29.000> beaming<00:01:29.420> them<00:01:29.600> utterly<00:01:30.080> still<00:01:30.440> have

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
before beaming them utterly still have

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.800 
before beaming them utterly still have
done<00:01:30.920> for<00:01:31.220> your<00:01:31.280> math<00:01:31.550> games<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.210> sucky<00:01:32.660> you

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
done for your math games you sucky you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.600 
done for your math games you sucky you
can't<00:01:32.990> just<00:01:33.140> beam<00:01:33.470> them<00:01:33.500> aboard<00:01:33.740> mid-fall

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
can't just beam them aboard mid-fall

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.300 
can't just beam them aboard mid-fall
look<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:36.020> like<00:01:36.200> an<00:01:36.320> orange<00:01:36.530> falling<00:01:37.190> at

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
look it's like an orange falling at

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.120 
look it's like an orange falling at
terminal<00:01:37.340> velocity<00:01:38.080> catching<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.259> with<00:01:40.070> a

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
terminal velocity catching it with a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.770 
terminal velocity catching it with a
baseball<00:01:40.399> bat<00:01:40.670> coming<00:01:41.450> from<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> other

baseball bat coming from the other

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.809 
baseball bat coming from the other
direction<00:01:41.990> won't<00:01:42.770> fix<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.250> told<00:01:43.580> you<00:01:43.789> you

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
direction won't fix that told you you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.969 
direction won't fix that told you you
suck<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.420> let<00:01:44.630> me<00:01:44.840> worry<00:01:45.170> about<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.530> power

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
suck you let me worry about the power

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.139 
suck you let me worry about the power
