around the flexi rod and make sure to
clamp<00:01:49.979> those<00:01:50.250> ends<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.909> by<00:01:51.450> bending<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> flexi

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
clamp those ends in by bending the flexi

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
clamp those ends in by bending the flexi
rod<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.180> whole<00:01:54.360> head<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
rod so I do my whole head like that I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.499 
rod so I do my whole head like that I
think<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> used<00:01:55.590> about<00:01:55.680> 12<00:01:56.100> flexi<00:01:56.670> rods<00:01:56.850> and

think I used about 12 flexi rods and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.510 
think I used about 12 flexi rods and
then<00:01:57.750> at<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.020> top<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> new<00:01:58.950> things<00:01:59.219> just

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
the curls away from my face

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.559

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
whereas in the rest of my head I like to

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.419 
whereas in the rest of my head I like to
alternate<00:02:09.050> which<00:02:09.259> direction<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:10.069> wrapped<00:02:10.280> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
alternate which direction I wrapped the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.339

curls<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.700> here<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> was<00:02:14.209> suffering<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.720> out<00:02:14.989> my

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
curls and here I was suffering in out my

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.260 
curls and here I was suffering in out my
face<00:02:15.680> framing<00:02:16.069> layers<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.730> they<00:02:16.849> could<00:02:17.000> get

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
face framing layers so they could get

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.809 
face framing layers so they could get
them<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:18.200> each<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.770> separate<00:02:19.130> curlers<00:02:19.550> and

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
them on each on separate curlers and

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.840 
them on each on separate curlers and
then<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.660> piece<00:02:20.870> right<00:02:21.230> by<00:02:21.500> my<00:02:22.250> face<00:02:22.520> I

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
then for the piece right by my face I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.300 
then for the piece right by my face I
like<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.600> leave<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> little<00:02:24.620> bit<00:02:24.800> more<00:02:24.860> space

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
like to leave a little bit more space

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.640 
like to leave a little bit more space
around<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.030> roots<00:02:26.239> area<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:26.930> those<00:02:27.110> don't<00:02:27.500> get

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
around the roots area so those don't get

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.220 
around the roots area so those don't get
curled<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.819> rod<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:30.050> sort<00:02:30.200> of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
curled on the rod and this just sort of

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
curled on the rod and this just sort of
get<00:02:30.440> will<00:02:30.620> give<00:02:30.770> me<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> foe<00:02:31.280> side<00:02:31.819> bang<00:02:32.120> effect

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.860 

so<00:02:37.250> once<00:02:37.459> you've<00:02:37.700> finished<00:02:37.940> all<00:02:38.330> your<00:02:38.360> flexi

the curl like that just make sure you

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.230 
the curl like that just make sure you
don't<00:05:03.500> yank<00:05:04.010> it<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.370> because<00:05:04.760> then<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.150> might

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
don't yank it out because then it might

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.640 
don't yank it out because then it might
get<00:05:05.389> stuck<00:05:05.660> in<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.960> white<00:05:06.110> ends<00:05:07.150> so<00:05:08.169> once<00:05:09.169> my

more oil and just gently separate the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.300 
more oil and just gently separate the
curls<00:05:15.229> because<00:05:15.530> they're<00:05:15.710> pretty<00:05:16.010> chunky

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
