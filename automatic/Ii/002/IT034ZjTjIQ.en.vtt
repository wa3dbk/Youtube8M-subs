studio<00:00:24.630> max<00:00:27.560> now<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> type<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
studio max now this is the type of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.030 
studio max now this is the type of
created<00:00:30.000> last<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.810> unfortunately<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
created last time and unfortunately I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.420 
created last time and unfortunately I
lost<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.850> initial<00:00:33.809> model<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.800> tutorial

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
can see for sharp edges so to remove

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.759 
can see for sharp edges so to remove
those<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:58.310> apply<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.730> messiness<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.629> or<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
those just apply the messiness to or the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.920 
those just apply the messiness to or the
terrible<00:03:01.280> smooth<00:03:01.549> but<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> normally<00:03:02.569> use<00:03:02.599> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
terrible smooth but I normally use the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.149 
terrible smooth but I normally use the
mesh<00:03:03.109> mesh<00:03:03.650> smooth<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.040> be

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
mesh mesh smooth and it's going to be

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.559 
mesh mesh smooth and it's going to be
more<00:03:07.370> software<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.060> increase<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
more software you can increase the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.170 
more software you can increase the
iterations<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.769> make<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.670> as<00:03:11.030> smooth<00:03:13.030> upset<00:03:14.030> my

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
iterations to make it as smooth upset my

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.069 
iterations to make it as smooth upset my
iterations<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.379> two<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:17.450> then<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:17.870> going<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
iterations to two and then I'm going to

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.890 
iterations to two and then I'm going to
drag<00:03:18.379> my<00:03:18.620> bowl<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:20.269> like<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:22.480> or<00:03:23.480> something

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
drag my bowl just like that or something

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.680 
drag my bowl just like that or something
like<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.669> then<00:03:25.669> drag<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.000> down<00:03:26.329> slightly

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
like that and then drag it down slightly

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.870 
like that and then drag it down slightly
and<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:29.610> looks<00:03:29.760> okay

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
and that looks okay

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.200 
and that looks okay
so<00:03:32.390> that's<00:03:32.630> what<00:03:32.780> we<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.320> far<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:35.030> in

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
so that's what we have so far and in

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.060 
so that's what we have so far and in
terms<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.840> glass<00:03:36.110> will<00:03:36.500> use<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.830> same

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
terms of the glass will use the same

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.300 
terms of the glass will use the same
method<00:03:37.550> once<00:03:37.790> more<00:03:38.150> or<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.050> create<00:03:39.410> shapes

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
method once more or to create shapes

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.980 
method once more or to create shapes
line<00:03:41.740> and<00:03:42.740> then<00:03:43.100> just<00:03:43.340> catch<00:03:43.820> out<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
line and then just catch out the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.050 
line and then just catch out the
cross-section<00:03:45.770> of<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.920> glass<00:03:46.340> maybe

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
cross-section of the glass maybe

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:56.030 
cross-section of the glass maybe
something<00:03:47.690> like<00:03:47.960> this

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.280 

click<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.849> may<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.120> here

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
click it may be here

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.100 
click it may be here
right<00:04:00.189> click<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.519> let<00:04:00.849> go<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.329> then<00:04:01.659> go<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.959> the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
right click to let go and then go to the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.660 
right click to let go and then go to the
modify<00:04:02.439> panel<00:04:02.590> again<00:04:03.159> select<00:04:04.060> late<00:04:05.459> click

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.970 

now<00:04:09.670> we'll<00:04:09.849> go<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.180> axis

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
now we'll go to the axis

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.540 
now we'll go to the axis
and<00:04:12.069> just<00:04:12.310> direct<00:04:13.150> out<00:04:13.510> up<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.319> their<00:04:14.530> 24<00:04:15.370> hour

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
and just direct out up to their 24 hour

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.970 
and just direct out up to their 24 hour
glass

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.920 

that's<00:04:20.520> what<00:04:20.730> we<00:04:20.820> have<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.300> far<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:24.390> bottom<00:04:24.900> is

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
that's what we have so far the bottom is

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.560 
that's what we have so far the bottom is
a<00:04:25.080> bit

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.860 

that's<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:28.050> bit<00:04:28.230> wide<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.920> we<00:04:29.070> can<00:04:29.390> fix<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.570> by

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
that's a bit wide so we can fix that by

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.660 
that's a bit wide so we can fix that by
going<00:04:31.110> back<00:04:31.760> onto<00:04:32.760> our<00:04:33.060> line<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.630> into<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
going back onto our line and into the

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.330 
going back onto our line and into the
vertex<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:36.210> just<00:04:37.050> drag<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.680> in<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.190> little

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
vertex and just drag that in a little

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.140 
vertex and just drag that in a little
bit<00:04:38.750> maybe<00:04:39.750> something<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:41.060> when<00:04:42.060> you

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
bit maybe something like that when you

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.400 
bit maybe something like that when you
go<00:04:42.300> back<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.750> late<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:45.600> bottom<00:04:45.900> look<00:04:46.170> so

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
go back to the late the bottom look so

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.670 
go back to the late the bottom look so
right<00:04:46.590> now<00:04:47.210> okay<00:04:48.210> with<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:49.290> we're<00:04:49.500> going<00:04:49.530> to

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
right now okay with that we're going to

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.100 
right now okay with that we're going to
apply<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> shell<00:04:52.290> modifier<00:04:52.830> also

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.890 

I<00:04:56.140> want<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:56.880> maybe<00:04:57.880> we<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.180> make<00:04:58.390> it<00:04:58.690> a

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
I want to do maybe we can make it a

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.350 
I want to do maybe we can make it a
little<00:04:59.170> bit<00:04:59.380> smaller<00:04:59.770> going<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.580> not<00:05:01.090> point

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
little bit smaller going to not point

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.200 
little bit smaller going to not point
one

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.110 

and<00:05:04.630> that's<00:05:04.840> gone<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:06.039> thickness<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.669> not<00:05:06.880> so

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
and that's gone the thickness is not so

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.870 
and that's gone the thickness is not so
much<00:05:07.500> also<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.530> apply<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.889> mesh<00:05:09.250> smooth<00:05:09.639> and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
much also I apply the mesh smooth and

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.779 
much also I apply the mesh smooth and
that<00:05:11.100> set<00:05:12.100> their<00:05:12.479> number<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.509> iteration<00:05:14.789> to

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
that set their number of iteration to

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.170 
that set their number of iteration to
whatever<00:05:16.630> makes<00:05:17.530> you<00:05:17.680> feel<00:05:17.710> comfortable<00:05:18.180> by

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
whatever makes you feel comfortable by

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.950 
whatever makes you feel comfortable by
be<00:05:19.360> careful<00:05:19.840> if<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:20.050> go<00:05:20.080> over<00:05:20.620> three<00:05:21.960> your

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
be careful if you go over three your

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.760 
be careful if you go over three your
computer<00:05:23.470> may<00:05:23.620> slow<00:05:23.919> down

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.900 

just<00:05:29.770> drag<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.360> oversaw<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:33.430> then<00:05:33.670> that's

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
just drag that oversaw and then that's

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.240 
just drag that oversaw and then that's
what<00:05:34.030> we<00:05:34.180> have<00:05:34.360> so<00:05:34.570> far<00:05:34.600> now<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.620> create<00:05:36.070> the

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
what we have so far now to create the

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.320 
what we have so far now to create the
base<00:05:36.430> that's<00:05:36.880> quite<00:05:37.030> simple<00:05:38.250> just<00:05:39.250> grab<00:05:40.180> the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
base that's quite simple just grab the

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.629 
base that's quite simple just grab the
box<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.910> drag<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.180> up

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
box and drag it up

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.670 
box and drag it up
you<00:05:45.060> may<00:05:45.240> be<00:05:45.740> here<00:05:47.180> then<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.900> see<00:05:49.319> where<00:05:49.530> your

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
you may be here then to see where your

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.869 
you may be here then to see where your
model<00:05:50.310> stand<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:52.590> just<00:05:52.860> call<00:05:53.129> either<00:05:53.430> on<00:05:53.699> the

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
model stand it just call either on the

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:59.420 
model stand it just call either on the
left<00:05:53.909> or<00:05:54.949> the<00:05:56.150> front<00:05:57.150> view<00:05:58.099> this<00:05:59.099> way<00:05:59.279> you<00:05:59.340> can

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
left or the front view this way you can

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.480 
left or the front view this way you can
adjust<00:05:59.669> the<00:06:00.680> position<00:06:04.219> just<00:06:05.219> to<00:06:05.279> make<00:06:05.460> sure
