 here we have the little glass where we would be 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.190
 casting the monomer 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.560

 you can hardly see it on the camera 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.190
 but it's like half yellow and it has 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.400
 shines 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.240
 have to see if some other 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.240
 decorations there 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.600

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.620
 and here they send a problem this is the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.430

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.460
 white and has a lot of brightness 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.460
 as a micro player 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.140
 and what I understand those two 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.360
 together with the collection, it depends on 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.520
 the luck of one that the color that you 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.830
 touch and touch the collection does not 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.860
 they all come out the same in that they do come 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.160

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.630
 but four or five different colors 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.450

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.410
