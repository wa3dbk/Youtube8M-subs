and<00:01:18.160> I<00:01:18.430> thought<00:01:18.610> well<00:01:18.790> while<00:01:18.970> with<00:01:19.180> all<00:01:19.330> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
and I thought well while with all that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.719 
and I thought well while with all that
water<00:01:19.720> content<00:01:20.320> it<00:01:20.470> would<00:01:20.590> take<00:01:20.799> forever<00:01:21.010> nope

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
water content it would take forever nope

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.570 
water content it would take forever nope
it<00:01:21.909> only<00:01:22.360> takes<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.810> day<00:01:22.960> apparently<00:01:23.580> 1213

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
it only takes a day apparently 1213

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.300 
it only takes a day apparently 1213

I'm not going to mess with that I'm just
a<00:01:38.409> hydrated<00:01:38.890> dehydrating<00:01:39.700> celery<00:01:40.060> today<00:01:40.420> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
a hydrated dehydrating celery today and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.210 
a hydrated dehydrating celery today and
she<00:01:41.799> has<00:01:41.830> this<00:01:42.220> really<00:01:42.280> cool<00:01:43.210> little<00:01:43.509> device

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

she has this really cool little device
it's<00:01:45.220> some<00:01:45.549> kind<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.850> onion<00:01:46.180> chopper<00:01:46.979> which

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
it's some kind of onion chopper which

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.230 
it's some kind of onion chopper which
I'm<00:01:48.159> not<00:01:48.280> going<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.460> mess<00:01:48.610> with<00:01:48.759> because<00:01:49.119> I

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
I'm not going to mess with because I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.510 
I'm not going to mess with because I
don't<00:01:49.390> have<00:01:49.509> all<00:01:49.900> we<00:01:50.650> gots<00:01:50.829> my<00:01:51.040> trusty<00:01:51.400> old

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
don't have all we gots my trusty old

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.550 
don't have all we gots my trusty old
knife<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.299> I'm<00:01:52.630> going<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.810> start<00:01:53.110> out<00:01:53.290> by

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
knife and I'm going to start out by

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.330 
knife and I'm going to start out by
cutting<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.579> dry<00:01:54.820> ends<00:01:55.210> over<00:01:55.360> here<00:01:56.100> off<00:01:57.100> of

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
cutting the dry ends over here off of

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.550 
cutting the dry ends over here off of
celery<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.840> right<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.409> the<00:02:00.149> tip<00:02:01.149> and<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
celery all right so the tip and the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.719 
celery all right so the tip and the
technique<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.729> guess<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.210> cut<00:02:04.899> this<00:02:05.110> as

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
technique is I guess to cut this as

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.910 
technique is I guess to cut this as
small<00:02:06.729> as<00:02:06.970> possible<00:02:07.210> because<00:02:07.600> if<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.470> pieces

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
small as possible because if the pieces

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.360 
small as possible because if the pieces
are<00:02:09.100> big<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:10.239> course<00:02:10.329> that's<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.200> then

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
are big of course that's going to then

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.759 
are big of course that's going to then
increase<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.420> dehydrating<00:02:13.420> time<00:02:13.840> here<00:02:14.650> we

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
increase the dehydrating time here we

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.660 
increase the dehydrating time here we
have<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.600> entire<00:02:16.600> celery<00:02:17.140> -<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
have the entire celery - the the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.360 
have the entire celery - the the
trimmings<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.829> can<00:02:20.950> see<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.190> makes

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
trimmings here you can see it makes

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.710

also learnt that celery is is not only

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.659 
also learnt that celery is is not only
full<00:04:51.789> of<00:04:51.820> vitamin<00:04:52.330> K<00:04:52.539> and<00:04:52.750> potassium<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:54.520> it

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.270 
full of vitamin K and potassium but it
has<00:04:54.849> a<00:04:54.880> compound<00:04:55.509> called<00:04:55.810> faylene<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.710> believe

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
has a compound called faylene I believe

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.820 
has a compound called faylene I believe
it<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.580> and<00:04:57.880> it's<00:04:58.509> good<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.990> reduce<00:04:59.590> blood

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it is and it's good to reduce blood

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.760 
it is and it's good to reduce blood
pressure<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.789> my<00:05:01.720> dad's<00:05:01.930> got<00:05:02.169> high<00:05:02.530> blood
