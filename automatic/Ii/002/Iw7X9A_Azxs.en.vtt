00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
cars.com auto review hi I'm Joe wiesenfelder
with cars.com we're taking a look at the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.120
2011 BMW 5-series it comes in six
hundred versions of 535 and soon 528 but

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.180
this is the top the 550 with a
twin-turbo VA now the 2011 is a complete

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
re-engineering and redesign bringing
some much needed changes the styling the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.340
previous generation had kind of weird
front-end the headlights had swoopy

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.460
looking like kinda eyebrows crazy stuff

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.800
this is much more handsome but we
actually have another problem with the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
headlights there's this white stripe
here that people don't like I don't like

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.510
it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.180
someone said it looks like film you're
supposed to pull off after you buy the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.390
car someone else called it a milk
mustache maybe in this case more of a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.670
milk eyebrow now the feature called
driving dynamics control allows you to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.449
choose between comfort and sport
settings using just a simple rocker

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.719
switch it used to be you have to hit one
button for the suspension another one

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.100
for sport mode on the transmission here
just starts out comfort you can go to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.789
normal

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.470
Sport and Sport Plus one thing I really
appreciate is if you don't want wood

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.830
trim which is standard little bit
old-fashioned for you can get the more

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.180
contemporary brushed aluminum and
there's actually a lot of it it is real

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.450
aluminum there's no doubt about that
when you see it for what it's worth

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.549
BMW is getting a little bit better about
cupholders location wise and size-wise

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.080
is a little bit more complex and it
probably needs to be but at least it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.829
better for a german manufacturer and
there's little keyfob holder i guess

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.470
that's handy if you go to the valet now
complete redesign of the automaker's one

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.340
chance to make big changes like an
interior space the cars 2 inches longer

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
overall three inches more wheelbase
unfortunately the interior isn't that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.030
much bigger at least in terms of legroom
I've got the seat all the way back I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.810
wouldn't mind a little bit more space
here in front one interesting thing in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.070
these sports seats is an additional
backrest adjustment not only the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.880
backrest tilt but this rocker switch
actually moves the top part forward and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.340
back spring meet the backseat is a
similar story when you see a car get

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.829
bigger on the outside you at least want
to see you get a little bit bigger on

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.160
the inside there's only a tenth of an
inch more leg room here in the back seat

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910
now it is workable the front seats all
the way back in the position I had it in

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.210
my knees are raised a little bit

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.290
but we just tested the M sedan from
infinity and it felt a little bit bigger

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.980
now one improvement in terms of size is
the trunk

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.300
this one is powered as an option it's
now 18.4 cubic feet which is a big

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.320
improvement over the 2010 models 14
cubic feet now you can get folding back

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.550
seats always good to have to extend the
cargo area forward

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.660
what bothers me is just like a lot of
luxury cars you have to pay almost five

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.800
hundred dollars to add that feature that
is free in ten-thousand-dollar cars it's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.790
maddening the v8 engine is more powerful
than wasn't 2010 and there's an

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.210
eight-speed instead of a six-speed
transmission so even though it's more

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.690
powerful you get better efficiency two
miles per gallon better City three miles

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.160
per gallon better highway 417 25 not bad
for a car that does 0 to 60 in about

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.390
five seconds get more information on the
