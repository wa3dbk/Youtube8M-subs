00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
getting quite close to this let's just

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
getting quite close to this let's just
focus<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.659> focus<00:01:22.170> I'm<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> focus<00:01:23.490> on

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
focus our up focus I'm going to focus on

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
focus our up focus I'm going to focus on
the<00:01:23.729> cooler<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.390> bench<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the cooler that bench there so that I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070 
the cooler that bench there so that I
now<00:01:26.280> I've<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.610> lots<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.060> depth<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> field<00:01:27.780> in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
now I've got lots of depth of field in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.880 
now I've got lots of depth of field in
close<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:29.900> lovely<00:01:30.900> bright<00:01:31.350> snowy

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
close to there lovely bright snowy

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.090 
close to there lovely bright snowy
intimate<00:01:32.610> snow<00:01:33.420> picture<00:01:34.020> much<00:01:34.560> better<00:01:34.860> than

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
intimate snow picture much better than

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620 
intimate snow picture much better than
the<00:01:35.189> trees<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.640> field<00:01:36.000> even<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.329> we'd<00:01:36.450> had

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the trees in my field even if we'd had

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
the trees in my field even if we'd had
the<00:01:36.750> light<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.590> still<00:01:37.860> works<00:01:38.070> better

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the light there this still works better

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.890 
the light there this still works better
because<00:01:38.520> we've<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> proper<00:01:39.420> point<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
because we've got a proper point of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
because we've got a proper point of
focus<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.560> look<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> by<00:01:41.549> composing<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
focus to look at and by composing it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 
focus to look at and by composing it
with<00:01:42.509> some<00:01:42.689> snow<00:01:42.899> strong<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> foreground

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
with some snow strong in the foreground

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.850 
with some snow strong in the foreground
we're<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.030> saying<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:46.020> snowy

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
we're really saying this is a good snowy

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.539 
we're really saying this is a good snowy
sort<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> scene<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.540> Christmassy<00:01:49.549> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
sort of a scene it's Christmassy the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.980 
sort of a scene it's Christmassy the
other<00:01:50.700> thing<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.090> works<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.570> our

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
other thing that works well our

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
other thing that works well our
close-ups<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:53.159> fine<00:01:53.460> details<00:01:54.119> which

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
close-ups little fine details which

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
close-ups little fine details which
probably<00:01:54.840> tell<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> snow<00:01:55.470> story<00:01:55.829> even<00:01:56.250> better

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
probably tell the snow story even better

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.110 
probably tell the snow story even better
than<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> wider<00:01:57.689> scene
