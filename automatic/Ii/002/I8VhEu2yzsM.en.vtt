lisa lee someone picked it up as that
game<00:02:06.299> did<00:02:06.600> look<00:02:06.780> promising<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
game did look promising and it like it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.339 
game did look promising and it like it
might<00:02:08.550> actually<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.239> return<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.780> form<00:02:09.810> for

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
might actually be a return to form for

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.710 
might actually be a return to form for

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
as there have been a few dead ones

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.150

but<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.250> looks<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.640> might<00:02:17.850> probably

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
but it looks like that might probably

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.140 
but it looks like that might probably
most<00:02:18.510> likely<00:02:18.690> won't<00:02:19.200> happen<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:21.030> not

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
most likely won't happen and it's not

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.460 
most likely won't happen and it's not
exactly<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> surprise<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.320> has

exactly a surprise that this has

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
franchise and develop that seems pretty

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.370 
franchise and develop that seems pretty
apt<00:05:03.540> although<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.690> course<00:05:04.720> he<00:05:05.050> wasn't<00:05:05.229> saying

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
apt although of course he wasn't saying

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.080 
apt although of course he wasn't saying
that<00:05:05.530> with<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> straight<00:05:05.800> face<00:05:05.919> but<00:05:06.160> still<00:05:06.729> it

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
that with a straight face but still it

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.540 
that with a straight face but still it
is<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.540> fair<00:05:07.870> point<00:05:08.169> Star<00:05:08.680> Wars<00:05:08.710> has<00:05:09.160> been

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
is a fair point Star Wars has been

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.700 
is a fair point Star Wars has been
pretty<00:05:10.210> beaten<00:05:10.660> down<00:05:10.960> in<00:05:11.229> terms<00:05:11.410> of<00:05:11.560> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
pretty beaten down in terms of the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.620 
pretty beaten down in terms of the
amount<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:12.070> games<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.700> so<00:05:12.880> on<00:05:13.000> release<00:05:13.210> for<00:05:13.510> it

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
amount of games and so on release for it

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.719 
amount of games and so on release for it
and<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:13.889> might<00:05:14.889> be<00:05:15.040> one<00:05:15.190> of<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.340> reasons

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
and that might be one of the reasons

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.360 
and that might be one of the reasons
that<00:05:16.020> lucasarts<00:05:17.020> have<00:05:17.169> kind<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.560> met<00:05:18.220> this

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
that lucasarts have kind of met this

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.240 
that lucasarts have kind of met this
fate<00:05:18.669> because<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:20.440> Star<00:05:20.710> Wars<00:05:20.830> games<00:05:21.070> were

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
fate because the Star Wars games were

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.969 
fate because the Star Wars games were
kind<00:05:21.550> of<00:05:21.700> their<00:05:22.000> biggest<00:05:22.389> games<00:05:22.690> and<00:05:23.350> recently

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
kind of their biggest games and recently

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.680 
kind of their biggest games and recently
they<00:05:24.190> haven't<00:05:24.520> been<00:05:24.639> in<00:05:24.790> that<00:05:24.820> big<00:05:25.210> especially

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
they haven't been in that big especially

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.810 
they haven't been in that big especially
with<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.900> colossal<00:05:26.380> failure<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:27.400> was<00:05:27.610> at

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
with the colossal failure that was at

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.879 
with the colossal failure that was at
the<00:05:27.910> Old<00:05:28.150> Republic<00:05:28.300> so<00:05:28.990> this<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.380> real<00:05:29.620> shame

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
the Old Republic so this is a real shame

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.490
