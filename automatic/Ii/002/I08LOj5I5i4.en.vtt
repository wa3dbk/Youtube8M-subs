00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.950
 difficult times me through my 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.219
 I'm just looking for fun and they accuse me and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.490
 they discriminate against me and I only do pop pop 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:20.029
 to have fun vicky something from the audience 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.029
 on issues of discrimination 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.820
 It's not like that for me 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.010
 confusion you have to separate things and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.599
 see and analyze them perfectly why 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.790
 I am doing a course of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
 discrimination like perfecting it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 because it is not only to give a course but 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.910
 give good 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.810
 good guys let's start with the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 discrimination class 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.950
 we have a chip 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.700
 - one day in April 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.840
 we see a group of morocho that comes down from the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.840
 station and they come towards us 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.019
 a shipper making the move 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.120
 we go with our car and we go through 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.120
 in front of fantastic danceable 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 we appeared in the middle of the series of 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 salty 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 yes 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.710
 and well of course I believe the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.760
 Latin American integration 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.400
 coincidentally I'm doing now a 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.830
 new game that is called the bowling a 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.710
 new game for you we can integrate 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.590
 Latin America playing as with the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.420
 bowling a very easy white ball 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.530
 manipulate that you have to throw and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.729
 rolling wheel rolls to the water heading to 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.920
 a group of immigrants from countries 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.570
 boundary lines that represent unity 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.759
 Latin American waiting for what the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.080
 natural selection deserves to give them all 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.899
 bullying because it's good that 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.270
 Latin Americans join like this the 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.789
 we hit everyone together 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.950
 colo beyond everything is a singer 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.959
 continue related to music 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.910
 Of course, of course, I still hai 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.560
 please, it's a question of mine, I'm still 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.690
 course with the theme of music and already 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.260
 I'm working on the launch of 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.260
 another subject 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:32.150
 she by its aspect forces me to prevent 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:36.459
 I do not know if it comes from work or if it 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.459
 about to steal 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.160
 your name of a criminal 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.160
 so similar to me deserves 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.420
 It is very good to judge 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.860
 respect and presence because a poor person is 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.740
 a potential criminal is so 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.890
 seemed so different is how 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:12.440
 distinguish a poor from a later 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:17.709
 is similar to the level that had distinguish 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.709
 a poor where he was poor 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.250
 well this is wrong is discriminatory 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.580
 you can not mix things people 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.400
 humble of work have come that I know 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.290
 that works please I know I have 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.090
 contact with reality I have staff 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.730
 of service I am not ignorant 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.060
 people approaching extended to a hand 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.610
 can be extended open to order with 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.550
 a weapon to steal but it's always about 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.550
 of the plant that is all they want 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.950
 but it's hard to believe that you have the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.060
 approach of reality to the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.640
 social spaces 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.470
 Well, excuse me, of course, that I 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360
 I go out and I have I have contact with the 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.290
 reality and I have contact with people 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.090
 poor visit a poor neighborhood I usually go to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.590
 deprived neighborhoods is a subject of 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.480
 marketing and to disguise other 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.950
 activities but very totally 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.580
 prepared to receive the affection of the 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.680
 people 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.130
 I wear a kiss protector to them 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.320
 love because they do not notice the tell if the 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.760
 people express me wants to touch me why 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.380
 I carry a double risk that if 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.330
 we would have a micky vanilla morocho 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.990
 rolling is no longer a morocho that still 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.509
 do not know 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.090
 because we say is with us but 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.880
 for these cases not well then the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.759
 the people moving experiences 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.400
 children all the emotion of 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.400
 know them knowing that I put my life 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.370
 They are also moments full of joy 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.380
 although this seems lie because I 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.120
 I visit a deprived neighborhood and the first thing 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.669
 I think always good how good that 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.009
 I do not live here I do not like to think 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.020
 also the idea of ​​visiting those neighborhoods 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.970
 poor and then the joy of knowing that 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.849
 I'm leaving and that those who stay are them 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.280
 they are wrong again being believers 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:08.740
 who consider of course that I 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.960
 I also believe that they are worth the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.970
 redundancy a god creation and you know 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.979
 that I believe that God made them first 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.289
 that with them practical and then to 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.340
 we made us see in the end what 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.509
 The only thing you do is describe 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.949
 despise not doing anything for others 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.420
 but you know that we are 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.490
 trying to make the poor 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.260
 return the trash in front of us 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.910
 our houses that we are raising the 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.020
 garbage earlier and that we're 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.090
 throwing in the deprived neighborhoods 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.160
 so that they can stir in the 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.960
 own territory where the birds live 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.690
 that we give them two separate bags where 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.820
 they say a bag this can eat this 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.320
 you can not eat you can sell it for 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.900
 that they can distinguish you know that 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.900
 we are doing that I wonder what he knows 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.259
 the heart sharpen the ear 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.120
 they collect all their hills I am 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.659
 always present for you doing 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.080
 little focus just for fun and just 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:10.379
 also to amuse you 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.379
 good night
