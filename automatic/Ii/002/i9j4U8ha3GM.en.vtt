00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
transforms it into a powerup now it is

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.540 
transforms it into a powerup now it is
pretty<00:00:38.470> random<00:00:38.920> it<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.280> know<00:00:39.370> it's<00:00:39.489> not

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
pretty random it you know it's not

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.010 
pretty random it you know it's not
something<00:00:39.880> where<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:40.090> automatically<00:00:40.629> set<00:00:40.899> it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
something where you automatically set it

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.229 
something where you automatically set it
up<00:00:41.109> and<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.350> changes<00:00:41.649> it<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.829> something<00:00:42.239> that

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
up and it changes it to something that

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.840 
up and it changes it to something that
you<00:00:43.690> want<00:00:43.989> so<00:00:44.289> it<00:00:44.469> could<00:00:44.649> be<00:00:44.680> double<00:00:45.309> points<00:00:45.760> it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
you want so it could be double points it

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.639 
you want so it could be double points it
could<00:00:45.969> be<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> nuke<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:46.750> could<00:00:46.870> be<00:00:47.079> you<00:00:47.500> know

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
could be a nuke it could be you know

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.979

cool way to to you know kind of have fun
with<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.750> map<00:00:55.929> obviously<00:00:56.410> this<00:00:56.469> is<00:00:56.620> something

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
with the map obviously this is something

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.380 
with the map obviously this is something
that<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.219> not<00:00:57.460> at<00:00:57.640> first<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:58.000> thought<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.300> would

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
that is not at first I thought it would

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.029 
that is not at first I thought it would
be<00:00:58.570> like<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.750> game-breaking<00:00:59.230> thing<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.679> can

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
be like a game-breaking thing you can

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.139 
be like a game-breaking thing you can
get<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.190> nuke<00:01:00.370> whenever<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.699> want<00:01:00.940> but

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
get a nuke whenever you want but

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.290 
get a nuke whenever you want but
honestly<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:03.550> not<00:01:03.699> going<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.879> be<00:01:03.969> able<00:01:04.000> to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
honestly you're not going to be able to

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.360 
honestly you're not going to be able to
you<00:01:05.140> need<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.320> have<00:01:05.530> time<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.130> need<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.340> be

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
you need to have time and you need to be

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.920 
you need to have time and you need to be
able<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.730> do<00:01:06.850> this<00:01:07.000> with<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.420> clear<00:01:07.450> head<00:01:07.690> and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
able to do this with a clear head and

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.480 
able to do this with a clear head and
not<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.170> lot<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.380> zombies<00:01:08.560> swarming<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.280> at<00:01:09.400> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
not a lot of zombies swarming you at the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.130 
not a lot of zombies swarming you at the
same<00:01:09.700> time<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.210> it's<00:01:10.390> not<00:01:10.510> something<00:01:10.750> where

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
same time so it's not something where

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.200 
same time so it's not something where
you<00:01:11.920> can<00:01:12.040> be<00:01:12.159> in<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.340> pack<00:01:12.579> of<00:01:12.759> horde<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.150> zombies

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
you can be in a pack of horde of zombies

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.359 
you can be in a pack of horde of zombies
and<00:01:13.810> then<00:01:13.930> give<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.409> Leroy<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.009> then<00:01:15.130> use

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
and then give it to Leroy and then use

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.740 
and then give it to Leroy and then use
the<00:01:15.520> nuke<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:15.970> know<00:01:16.060> maybe<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.390> could<00:01:16.479> have

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
the nuke you know maybe you could have

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.480 
the nuke you know maybe you could have
all<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.990> zombies<00:01:17.110> training<00:01:17.650> somewhere<00:01:18.009> and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
all the zombies training somewhere and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.340 
all the zombies training somewhere and
you<00:01:18.579> can<00:01:18.700> have<00:01:18.820> Leroy<00:01:19.119> doing<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:19.570> but<00:01:20.079> in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
you can have Leroy doing this but in

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.380 
you can have Leroy doing this but in
terms<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.740> playing<00:01:20.979> solo<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.090> know<00:01:22.210> you'd<00:01:22.360> be

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
terms of playing solo you know you'd be

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.149 
terms of playing solo you know you'd be
getting<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.960> power<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.530> towards<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.920> end<00:01:24.070> of

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
getting the power of towards the end of

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.649 
getting the power of towards the end of
a<00:01:24.250> round<00:01:24.430> or<00:01:24.759> something<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.240> which<00:01:25.540> I

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
a round or something like that which I

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.850 
a round or something like that which I
mean<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.899> could<00:01:25.960> be<00:01:26.079> helpful<00:01:26.259> but<00:01:26.530> honestly

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
mean it could be helpful but honestly

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.679 
mean it could be helpful but honestly
it's<00:01:27.430> not<00:01:27.579> as<00:01:27.729> helpful<00:01:27.939> as<00:01:28.149> doing<00:01:28.390> something

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
it's not as helpful as doing something

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.389 
it's not as helpful as doing something
