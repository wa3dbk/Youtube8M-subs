00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
to find a way to use it to your

advantage

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
advantage

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.140

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
but if that doesn't happen soon this one

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:15.340

could<00:04:05.329> be<00:04:05.510> done<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:11.329> game

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.789 

watch<00:04:16.350> it

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.550

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.680 

but<00:04:51.640> Chris<00:04:51.970> Jericho<00:04:52.480> just<00:04:52.720> did

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
but Chris Jericho just did

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.540 
but Chris Jericho just did
we<00:04:55.230> sure<00:04:55.470> hope<00:04:55.620> triple<00:04:56.040> H<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.340> be<00:04:56.460> okay

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.480 

medical<00:05:02.330> staff<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.930> tending<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.680> Triple<00:05:04.010> H<00:05:04.160> I

medical staff is tending to Triple H I
guess<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.330> goes<00:05:05.450> without<00:05:05.630> saying<00:05:06.080> that

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
guess it goes without saying that

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:15.780 
guess it goes without saying that
there'll<00:05:06.410> be<00:05:06.440> no<00:05:06.530> rematch<00:05:07.070> tonight
