those<00:01:13.800> of<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.280> follow<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.670> channel<00:01:14.960> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
those of you can follow my channel I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
those of you can follow my channel I
think<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> last<00:01:16.590> time<00:01:16.800> i<00:01:16.920> did<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.159> length<00:01:17.430> check

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
think the last time i did a length check

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
think the last time i did a length check
um<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> numbers

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
um I have to go and look at the numbers

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.850 
um I have to go and look at the numbers
but<00:01:21.360> i<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:21.990> longest<00:01:22.470> length<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:23.070> like

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
but i think my longest length was like

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.290 
but i think my longest length was like
18<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:27.200> 17<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.560> 18<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.210> my

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
18 I think 17 or 18 and then I think my

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.969 
18 I think 17 or 18 and then I think my
shortest<00:01:30.630> piece<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:31.050> like<00:01:31.200> 15<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> half

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
shortest piece was like 15 and a half

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
shortest piece was like 15 and a half
and<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.880> did<00:01:33.060> another<00:01:33.090> length<00:01:33.659> check<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and then I did another length check I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
and then I did another length check I
had<00:01:34.860> straightened<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.369> hair<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.670> went<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
had straightened my hair I went to this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
had straightened my hair I went to this
party<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.780> straighten<00:01:37.080> my<00:01:37.170> hair<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.770> did

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
party and straighten my hair and did

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
party and straighten my hair and did
another<00:01:38.070> length<00:01:38.520> check<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
another length check and I have that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
another length check and I have that
footage<00:01:40.050> i'll<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> look<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.740> those

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
footage i'll have to look at those

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
footage i'll have to look at those
measurements<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.729> i<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:42.000> i<00:01:42.060> gained<00:01:42.300> like

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
measurements but i think i gained like

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.969 
measurements but i think i gained like
two<00:01:42.750> inches<00:01:42.929> because<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.410> think<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.679> was<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
two inches because i think it was like a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
two inches because i think it was like a
couple<00:01:44.310> months<00:01:44.399> ago<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.910> i<00:01:44.940> think<00:01:45.030> i<00:01:45.240> gained

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
couple months ago so i think i gained

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.639 
couple months ago so i think i gained
two<00:01:45.660> inches<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.860> i<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.039> i<00:01:47.970> think<00:01:48.649> she

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
two inches and so i think i think she

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.139 
two inches and so i think i think she
chopped<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.789> i'm<00:01:51.570> gonna<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.929> between

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
seven i'm gonna say between eight and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.219 
seven i'm gonna say between eight and
ten<00:01:56.190> inches<00:01:56.759> she<00:01:57.270> chopped<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.690> in<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:57.929> hair
