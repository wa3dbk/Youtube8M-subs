00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.619
 computer programming tips here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.260
 no beep vtv 2 and the tip of today is personal 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.660
 I want to talk to you about 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.170
 restore system how to create as 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 use 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.200
 we are going to see it now at bv tv2 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 I 'm already here on the desktop. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 is a person for whom he does not know 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.540
 system restore works from the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.090
 next way 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.360
 you often have something to install 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.520
 in your on your pc is a program is the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 Come on, and you're half-way behind. 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 It will be a problem 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.140
 Is it going to bring trouble? 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 I will lose it's speed 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 computer becomes poor and the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 Sometimes the person is left 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.560
 then nothing better than creating a point 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.720
 restore system because the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.180
 system restore it will 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.010
 that you come back anytime 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.439
 thing that happens wrong in your 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.049
 computer it will provide you with 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.479
 you come back to a point before 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.420
 installation is the point where your 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 machine is working perfectly 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 I know it's a thing is very simple 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.619
 but many people do not know how to say 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.720
 windows and how it went like 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.869
 People are discovering this as hot. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.850
 program this is simple we did not come 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 here o 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.170
 here on this screen that on computer you 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.780
 will right-click 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.950
 you will see property here in 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.369
 property 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.979
 this screen that let increase here 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.649
 here is this button that this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.979
 tool that calls settings 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.770
 just click on it and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.840
 will open this little window here here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.450
 In this little window you will put the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 system protection 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.430
 here you will see here has the restoration 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.430
 of the system 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.100
 restoring the system can help 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.440
 to correct problems that may cause 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.780
 slow down or stop 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.940
 responding to system restore does not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.940
 affects any of your documents images 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.490
 and other personal data programs and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.040
 newly installed drives can be 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.420
 uninstalled then as I explained that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.910
 need not be afraid that they are of 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.950
 images of the things you put 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.260
 You will not mess with it, it will 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.070
 the issue of the installation of 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.020
 and drives okay so it 's is left after 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.410
 discharge a noisy car here 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.720
 people have come back and we returned here 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.170
 car wins I go here but it did not come 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.450
 so this here is very nice're 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.890
 Browse through the system it already has here 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.840
 programmed right 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.670
 in some cases you will not appear 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.210
 here already has scheduled the day is 9 of a 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.540
 which in the case was yesterday then has a 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.500
 The system here is and has here the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.020
 demonstrate more restore points 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.370
 30/12 is seeing you can come back right? 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.270
 let's suppose that a problem happened 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.340
 for you brand here and you boot forward 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.800
 and will remain the system for the day 30 12 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.380
 so if the problem occurred on the 1st 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.180
 for example, is that problem that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.950
 occurred more as though it were never 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.930
 had existed 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.269
 now you can also create a person 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.140
 restore point where I am seeing it here 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.000
 on this button 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.130
 read here with me acre a point of 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.310
 now for the drives with 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.769
 system protection enabled to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.930
 O create here will create open this window 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.090
 Restore points are written here 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.340
 or enter a description to help you 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.400
 identify the restore point to 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.500
 date and time are added 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.290
 automatically then you need to 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.390
 worry about the date or time because the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.850
 computer is doing well even if it is 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.489
 Do you have something to do something for? 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.900
 to install that you're really behind 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.150
 The reason is that the virus has 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.460
 Damn my computer you come here 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.710
 in creating that you put some 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.020
 thing I'm going to put here for example I 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.210
 I'll put 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.069
 the test is creating a restore a 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.440
 point of system installation with the 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.440
 name test the attack create 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.039
 it is creating restore point 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.400
 It's there you can put it, I do not know, right? 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.919
 put something to you to identify and 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.199
 and whatever you do in your 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.560
 computer after that date any 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.139
 thing that goes wrong you just have to restore 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.539
 the system and beauty 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.319
 What you put is not going to work. 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.139
 exist 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.690
 for example the restore point 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.199
 created with this not close is already 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.970
 created 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.720
 before showing you to explain a 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.810
 business here and let's assume that on the 30th 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.400
 you have created this system restore at 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.280
 day 30 and on day 31 you got installed 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.610
 one program was any program 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.889
 on your computer and this program caused 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.900
 slowness on your computer 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:35.870
 Ah and you, you are not sure if 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.770
 was it just was not thing can you do 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.229
 will test the system right? 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.430
 There you go to restore it will come back 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.500
 for the 30th 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.389
 and that program that you are crazy about 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.889
 that caused the slowness it will not be 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.759
 more installed so much is so 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.500
 it works 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.750
 There was one here to see if you consume someone 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.520
 convinced the point that we created is 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:02.750
 Here System Restore forward and okay 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.000
 O rate here right today to ten I'm 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.580

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.599
 but those of even one that is now a 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.039
 Friday, 2014 exactly at 10 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.349
 hours and 29 minutes 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.620
 now that we've created the event here 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.330
 so anything in the morning 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.860
 I do it on any computer. 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.800
 problem can I come here 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.190
 boot here oh nerds restore point 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.819
 that I created boot to advance and it goes 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.440
 to restore and the entire system is 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.320
 Good, I hope you liked it. 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.719
 I like this tip. 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.580
 add favorites by doing so you 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.490
 helps us grow enough 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:48.490
