battery life is to go into the settings

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
battery life is to go into the settings
obviously<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.810> pretty<00:01:06.990> simple<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
obviously it's pretty simple and you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310 
obviously it's pretty simple and you
want<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.460> off<00:01:08.640> auto<00:01:08.939> refresh<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
want to take off auto refresh if you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
wanted to auto refresh you can all

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.429 
wanted to auto refresh you can all
refreshing<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.240> Wi-Fi<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
refreshing on Wi-Fi but I would take it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
refreshing on Wi-Fi but I would take it
off<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.369> let<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.700> auto<00:01:14.850> refresh<00:01:15.299> by<00:01:15.540> itself

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
off do not let it auto refresh by itself

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.210 
off do not let it auto refresh by itself
because<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.409> kill<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:16.799> battery<00:01:17.009> life

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220

significantly<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.229> turn<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> off

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
significantly when if you turn that off

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.850 
significantly when if you turn that off

would like but it when you take
blinkfeed<00:01:30.900> off<00:01:31.340> because<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:33.360> just

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
blinkfeed off because it just is just

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.800 
blinkfeed off because it just is just
sinking<00:01:34.170> over<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.650> over<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:35.810> another

sinking over and over again another

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
thing is that a lot of people I think I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.069 
thing is that a lot of people I think I
don't<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> people<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
pretty simple actually I could do is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.740 
pretty simple actually I could do is
pinch<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.579> up<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.640> obviously<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
pinch this and up here obviously you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
pinch this and up here obviously you
have<00:01:49.070> different<00:01:50.070> homes<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.490> could<00:01:50.610> add<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
have different homes you could add up to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.800 
have different homes you could add up to
you<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.710> five<00:01:52.710> homes<00:01:53.119> one<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.270> used<00:01:54.509> up

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you got out to five homes one is used up

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.859 
you got out to five homes one is used up
by<00:01:54.990> blinkfeed<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:55.950> only<00:01:56.250> for

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
by blinkfeed so you really have only for

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.880 
by blinkfeed so you really have only for
doing<00:01:57.869> feed<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> default<00:01:59.360> home<00:02:00.360> page

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
doing feed is is the default home page

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.930 
doing feed is is the default home page
so<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.970> would<00:02:02.090> be<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.720> normally<00:02:03.940> so

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
so it would be like this normally so

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.460 
so it would be like this normally so
when<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.450> hit<00:02:05.570> home<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.080> would<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.409> to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
when you hit home it would go to

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.730 
when you hit home it would go to
blinkfeed<00:02:07.040> basically<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:09.200> easiest<00:02:09.590> way<00:02:09.679> to

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
blinkfeed basically the easiest way to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.210 
blinkfeed basically the easiest way to
get<00:02:09.920> rid<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.890> said<00:02:13.100> if

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
much is pretty simple but like i said

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.029 
much is pretty simple but like i said
the<00:05:40.150> add<00:05:40.599> that<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:40.960> you<00:05:41.020> just<00:05:41.380> caused<00:05:41.560> widgets

the add that I you just caused widgets

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.159 
the add that I you just caused widgets
Lloyd<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.849> I<00:05:43.150> were<00:05:43.300> downloaded<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:43.960> it's<00:05:44.050> on

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
Lloyd and I were downloaded and it's on

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.810 
Lloyd and I were downloaded and it's on
the<00:05:44.320> pull<00:05:44.590> down<00:05:44.620> bar<00:05:45.070> it's<00:05:45.340> actually<00:05:45.669> up<00:05:45.789> here

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
the pull down bar it's actually up here

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.540 
the pull down bar it's actually up here
so<00:05:46.719> if<00:05:46.840> I<00:05:46.960> hit<00:05:47.169> this<00:05:47.199> right<00:05:47.560> here<00:05:47.770> my<00:05:48.039> data<00:05:48.310> will

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
so if I hit this right here my data will

actually like if you notice like things

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.040

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
will pop up a lot quicker you still get

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.960 
will pop up a lot quicker you still get
some<00:06:50.289> animations<00:06:50.919> but<00:06:51.190> you're<00:06:51.610> not<00:06:51.729> going<00:06:51.909> to

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
some animations but you're not going to

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.290 
some animations but you're not going to
get<00:06:52.090> every<00:06:52.419> single<00:06:52.750> one<00:06:53.250> but<00:06:54.250> I<00:06:54.699> think<00:06:55.210> it

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
get every single one but I think it

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.339 
get every single one but I think it
