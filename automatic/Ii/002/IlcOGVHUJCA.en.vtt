00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.160
 Peugeot the press I just shot on a mini bar their rising 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.819
 Polished 5008 Colom 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.219
 "We will now share the knife with the tens of thousands of grain 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.390
 The tens of thousands of stone from the Show Sedan series is the most explosive stone 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.720
 from the Neva 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.400
 This will also make swords such as Qatar polish that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.650
 this stone delivered with a conventional household book 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.050
 which is placed under the stone and a stone move while it is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.610
 To prevent stocks 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.140
 Before use, please put the cloth under the stone 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.510
 bitter also in the stone briefly in a bowl of water this stone takes 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.640
 barely any water and therefore you can start late with the Polisher 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 the quarry did not previously become waters 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.070
 if we are with this little the buga stone over that smile two 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.950
 Weather protection very much that no umbrella stored 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.050
 it forms a live master who polish the stone an even larger 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
 function lends 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.800
 I want to polish the knife just as well as in the previous ones 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.530
 Presented presentations 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.450
 I start again Bernd Kling at the end 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 and polish with slow movements 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 So pick tip 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.280
 I only exert very little pressure to avoid being on the other side 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 forming a degree 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.590
 now I polish the other side sound 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.080
 Again important is the entire sounds to loops from the sounding end 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 to the top 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:18.139
 while the knife already with a small window from Untersteinbach 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.479
 have worked out 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.829
 we need the polisher snarls on the tens of thousands praises short praise 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.089
 perform 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.189
 we pull the sounds a few times over the steep 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.189
 and that it is sufficient 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.329
 Finally, I pull both sides of the song twice over the stone 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.329
 ever-decreasing pressure 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.229
 we will test it again 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.599
 Carefully move the knife is all starts
