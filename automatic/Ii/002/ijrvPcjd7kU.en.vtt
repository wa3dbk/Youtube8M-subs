wasn't<00:01:08.399> until<00:01:09.090> Paulie<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.719> really<00:01:10.700> looked<00:01:11.700> at

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
wasn't until Paulie I really looked at

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.419

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
then I thought about a few great

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.459 
then I thought about a few great
shooters<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> had<00:01:17.789> and<00:01:18.469> remembered

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
basically what they did what made this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.819 
basically what they did what made this
shot<00:01:22.890> more<00:01:23.369> effective<00:01:24.000> than<00:01:24.149> most<00:01:24.359> guys<00:01:24.829> what

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
shot more effective than most guys what

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.609 
shot more effective than most guys what
made<00:01:26.219> this<00:01:26.459> shot<00:01:26.880> quicker<00:01:27.869> than<00:01:28.140> most<00:01:28.319> guys

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
and to be honest with you I didn't
realize<00:01:33.599> it<00:01:33.899> until<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.649> really<00:01:34.979> started<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
realize it until I really started to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.109 
realize it until I really started to
analyze<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.619> pot<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.189> call<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
analyze it it was that pot we call the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.130 
analyze it it was that pot we call the
dip<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.500> catch<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.179> dipping<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.959> ball

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
not to not have to change but the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.759 
not to not have to change but the
reality<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.400> change<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.359> good<00:03:48.689> it<00:03:49.620> is

necessary change for the sake of change
I<00:03:52.260> think<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:53.010> foolish<00:03:53.459> but<00:03:54.680> what<00:03:55.680> you've<00:03:55.829> got

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
I think is foolish but what you've got

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.920 
I think is foolish but what you've got
to<00:03:56.189> be<00:03:56.459> at<00:03:56.670> all<00:03:56.819> times<00:03:56.849> is<00:03:57.450> you've<00:03:57.629> got<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
to be at all times is you've got to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.599 
to be at all times is you've got to
always<00:03:58.049> be<00:03:58.260> open<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.219> receptive<00:04:00.409> to<00:04:01.409> the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
always be open and receptive to the

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.039 
always be open and receptive to the
possibility<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.639> change<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.510> when<00:04:03.629> you<00:04:03.780> see

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
possibility of change and when you see

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.159 
possibility of change and when you see
something<00:04:04.650> that's<00:04:05.189> different<00:04:05.870> but<00:04:06.870> more

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
something that's different but more

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.470 
something that's different but more
effective<00:04:07.859> than<00:04:08.430> what<00:04:08.700> you've<00:04:08.909> done<00:04:09.150> and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
effective than what you've done and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.599 
effective than what you've done and
right<00:04:10.019> now<00:04:10.200> we're<00:04:10.439> talking<00:04:10.620> about<00:04:11.159> shooting

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
right now we're talking about shooting

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.539 
right now we're talking about shooting
we're<00:04:11.970> talking<00:04:12.389> about<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.950> body<00:04:14.220> being

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
we're talking about the body being

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.819 
we're talking about the body being
turned<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.109> almost<00:04:16.410> like<00:04:16.650> I'm

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
turned so that it's almost like I'm

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.580 
turned so that it's almost like I'm
instead<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.759> shooting<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.389> basketball<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.199> think

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
instead of shooting a basketball I think

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.279 
instead of shooting a basketball I think
of<00:04:19.739> shooting<00:04:20.130> dots<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.419> I'm<00:04:21.570> shooting

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
of shooting dots so that I'm shooting

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.980 
of shooting dots so that I'm shooting
square<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.669> center<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.240> my<00:04:24.419> target

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
square to the to the center of my target

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.499 
square to the to the center of my target
when<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.500> think<00:04:25.919> about<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.550> dip<00:04:26.849> when<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.180> think

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
when I think about the dip when I think

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.540 
when I think about the dip when I think
about<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:28.050> swag<00:04:28.410> when<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.770> think<00:04:29.070> about<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
about the swag when I think about the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.129 
about the swag when I think about the
follow-through<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.270> refer<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.599> it<00:04:30.870> as<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
follow-through and I refer to it as the

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.040 
follow-through and I refer to it as the
pinch<00:04:31.500> okay<00:04:32.160> at<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.610> end<00:04:32.639> of<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.940> shot<00:04:33.180> all

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
pinch okay at the end of the shot all

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.189 
pinch okay at the end of the shot all
those<00:04:34.530> things<00:04:35.009> are<00:04:35.460> little<00:04:35.910> things<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.599> in

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
those things are little things and in

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.040 
those things are little things and in
many<00:04:37.409> many<00:04:37.650> cases<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.490> might<00:04:39.120> mean<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.510> we

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
many many cases it might mean that we

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.129 
many many cases it might mean that we

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
I'm a firm believer and I've always

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.410 
I'm a firm believer and I've always
preached<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.950> defense<00:05:15.460> wins<00:05:15.670> championships

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
preached the defense wins championships

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.050 
preached the defense wins championships
and<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.890> still<00:05:18.190> believe<00:05:18.220> that<00:05:18.640> you<00:05:18.730> have<00:05:18.910> to

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
and I still believe that you have to

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.760 
and I still believe that you have to
play<00:05:19.240> really<00:05:19.450> great<00:05:19.810> defense<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.470> other<00:05:20.590> win

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
play really great defense and other win

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.890 
play really great defense and other win
championships<00:05:21.430> but<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.180> also<00:05:22.330> better<00:05:22.720> be

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
championships but you also better be

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.990 
championships but you also better be
able<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.140> score<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:24.250> better<00:05:24.490> be<00:05:24.670> able<00:05:24.790> to

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
able to score and you better be able to

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.060 
able to score and you better be able to
shoot<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.540> especially<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.470> this<00:05:26.590> day<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.830> age

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
shoot and especially in this day and age

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.450 
shoot and especially in this day and age
where<00:05:27.490> you<00:05:28.120> know<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:29.020> game<00:05:29.260> has<00:05:29.620> had<00:05:30.010> become

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
where you know the game has had become

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.710 
where you know the game has had become
and<00:05:30.700> I<00:05:30.760> think<00:05:30.910> it's<00:05:31.030> going<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.210> change<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.600> lot

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
and I think it's going to change a lot

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.270 
and I think it's going to change a lot
with<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.140> effort<00:05:32.380> with<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.590> change<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.190> the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
with the effort with the change and the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.430 
with the effort with the change and the
emphasis<00:05:33.700> on<00:05:33.850> rules<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.900> are<00:05:35.020> gonna<00:05:35.140> start

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
emphasis on rules that are gonna start

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.110 
emphasis on rules that are gonna start
this<00:05:35.650> year<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:35.950> college<00:05:36.190> basketball<00:05:36.430> and

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
this year in college basketball and

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.420 
this year in college basketball and
hopefully<00:05:37.480> trickle<00:05:37.810> down<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.260> that<00:05:38.980> is<00:05:39.160> that

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
hopefully trickle down and that is that

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.390 
hopefully trickle down and that is that
that<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:40.180> you<00:05:40.810> know<00:05:40.840> subway<00:05:41.350> once<00:05:42.190> more

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
that the you know subway once more

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.150 
that the you know subway once more
scoring<00:05:42.730> so<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:44.020> rules<00:05:44.290> are<00:05:44.590> gonna<00:05:44.830> basically

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
scoring so the rules are gonna basically

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.420 
scoring so the rules are gonna basically
get<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:45.970> defenders<00:05:46.570> off<00:05:46.810> their<00:05:47.410> men<00:05:47.680> so<00:05:48.280> that

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
get the defenders off their men so that

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.340 
get the defenders off their men so that
they<00:05:48.550> haven't<00:05:48.730> have<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.240> chance<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.870> maybe<00:05:50.050> get

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
they haven't have a chance to maybe get

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.770 
they haven't have a chance to maybe get
a<00:05:50.380> mid-range<00:05:51.130> or<00:05:51.490> a<00:05:51.550> three-point<00:05:52.120> shot<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.570> lot

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
a mid-range or a three-point shot a lot

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.140 
a mid-range or a three-point shot a lot
more<00:05:53.020> easily<00:05:53.200> so<00:05:53.890> that<00:05:54.070> scores<00:05:54.460> will<00:05:54.730> start<00:05:55.000> to

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
more easily so that scores will start to

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.159 
more easily so that scores will start to
go<00:05:55.270> up<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:56.200> you<00:05:56.590> know<00:05:56.740> shooting<00:05:57.250> I<00:05:57.660> mean<00:05:58.660> can<00:05:58.960> I

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
go up so you know shooting I mean can I

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.630 
go up so you know shooting I mean can I
mean<00:05:59.470> it's<00:05:59.650> gonna<00:05:59.830> become<00:06:00.220> even<00:06:00.430> more

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
mean it's gonna become even more

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.270 
mean it's gonna become even more
critical<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.840> you<00:06:02.350> know<00:06:02.470> yeah<00:06:02.710> as<00:06:02.830> much<00:06:03.010> as<00:06:03.160> I

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
critical and you know yeah as much as I

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.270 
critical and you know yeah as much as I
think<00:06:03.340> defense<00:06:04.000> wins<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:04.540> I<00:06:04.600> know<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:04.900> does<00:06:05.280> it

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
think defense wins and I know it does it

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.430 
think defense wins and I know it does it
wins<00:06:06.910> a<00:06:07.120> lot<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.360> championships<00:06:07.870> providing

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
wins a lot of championships providing

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.630 
wins a lot of championships providing
you<00:06:08.530> can<00:06:08.680> also<00:06:08.830> put<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.220> ball<00:06:09.370> in<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.460> basket

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
score maybe another here might be

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.860 
score maybe another here might be
another<00:06:18.100> five<00:06:18.340> points<00:06:18.610> again<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.630> might<00:06:19.780> be

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
another five points again that might be

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.909 
another five points again that might be
the<00:06:20.020> difference<00:06:20.140> between<00:06:20.410> winning<00:06:20.830> and

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
the difference between winning and

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.770 
the difference between winning and
losing<00:06:21.010> so<00:06:21.610> guess<00:06:21.880> what<00:06:22.120> you<00:06:22.300> better<00:06:22.450> be<00:06:22.660> able

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
losing so guess what you better be able

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.900 
losing so guess what you better be able
to<00:06:22.900> score<00:06:23.260> in<00:06:23.530> order<00:06:24.040> to<00:06:24.100> score<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.520> better<00:06:24.700> be

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
to score in order to score you better be

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.480 
to score in order to score you better be
able<00:06:25.030> to<00:06:25.210> shoot<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.870> basketball<00:06:26.320> and<00:06:26.650> that

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
able to shoot the basketball and that

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.070
