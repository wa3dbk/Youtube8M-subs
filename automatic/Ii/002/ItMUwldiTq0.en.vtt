00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:14.079
 the case today as lead exterminators seems to capture 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.939
 evil spirits is a good deal so much so that some tv programs if used 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.349
 the subject even seems to have no end of the ghost hunting seems ridiculous to mix 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.650
 this theme and I'm going to firm the state of Rio de Janeiro over Swiss 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.020
 everything began in 1975 when she debuted in the region is rich in cpst after the scare 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.409
 the problem with actual actors produced by the movies year 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.889
 and shows the five thousand adventures much smaller by having captured behind the 

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:47.699
 eyes of the past in Brazil the series was baptized with the name of trio chill 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.570
 is lower than it was made in may paulo 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.540
 the actress came to an end after the first season produced only 15 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 episodes 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.460
 was not 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 in 1984 it was Murilo's turn to take an interest in the subject 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.830
 in the untitled feature film 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.150
 was uploaded by fernão on 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.790
 the candidate of the dreams of election had nothing to do with the trio chill 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 The team made a great success I have house music and it has turned into one of the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.900
 big hits from the 80's 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
 now 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.200
 so they take advantage of the public's interest for the end of the year and prepared 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.280
 to resurrect his own sleeping creation was about the return 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 of the original 12 stations 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.909
 only this time with the cartoon 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.060
 a problem encountered by the producer to bring back the ghost hunters 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.650
 It was always a sad day they had released an animated series based on 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.330
 the title was precisely with the production of the permission 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.330
 I have to accept an exit 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.680
 after a brief confusion between the public and the private while the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.780
 of the regional council in another city at the end of the race 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.290
 had to undergo a change to 10 thousand two explosions the debut of both 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.290
 happened in the year 1986 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:35.010
 all over brazil from the donations of ghost entities and was exhibited on sbt 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:40.249
 local damásio wonder while the globe network exhibited the ghost hunters based 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.249
 in the faithful film xou xuxa program 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:59.949
 but exterminators of ghosts exhibited by the sbt showed the adventures of the gorilla 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.629
 principle that the two children of the old casapronta of the municipality 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.629
 that the dr 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.659
 I did not leave but the palace is one thing 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.309
 We're going to have to discuss this a lot. 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.799
 our heroes were accustomed to living with Hector palaces 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.840
 who were aided by the adventures the ghost command was totally haunted 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.319
 train 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.769
 the movement of the servers was a leading hand 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.129
 but one tip of the penis and had ten pilots the use of the most sinister 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.230
 to try to dominate the world with the bad or good result we are always 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.969
 following the great villain hahaha 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:48.599
 the afm 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.029
 he said that it is not necessary to identify himself to the agency 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.029
 is like wanting to create controversy with the third place 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:57.989
 I got to read 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.569
 this is the worst is that no one seems to want evil during a gymkhana 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 with moral 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 click here 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.479
 the soap opera 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.479
 not 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.319
 does not change anything 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.509
 Andre Luis

 in santa maria da feira will yield many productions of cinema 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.590
 television but we want to remember that in the 80's in sbt 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.110
 to his output filmi game with dubbing done by the network artists two years ago 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.820
 behind the boomerang channel I can discourage on the cloudy foot the signal one 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.810
 very bad reality then our message to channel programmers 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.560
 when you go down the wall and cheer up the show I looked for some 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.250
 company is a competent company, there are those who do this with at least one 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.670
 year to be more or less equal to the original dubbing network is complicated 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.830
 you see well-known names of pro-Gaddafi characters even with the 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.600
