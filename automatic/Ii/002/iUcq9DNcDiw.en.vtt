00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
right now yeah yeah but at the same see

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.440 
right now yeah yeah but at the same see
exactly<00:04:17.340> these<00:04:18.340> types<00:04:18.640> of<00:04:18.729> situations<00:04:18.910> are

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
exactly these types of situations are

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.930 
exactly these types of situations are
like<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.049> scary<00:04:20.320> thing<00:04:20.590> like<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.549> don't<00:04:21.789> want

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
like the scary thing like you don't want

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.960 
like the scary thing like you don't want
to<00:04:22.060> give<00:04:22.210> camy<00:04:22.510> meter<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.200> ammo<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.729> rest

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
to give camy meter and ammo for the rest

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.719 
to give camy meter and ammo for the rest
of<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.150> realms<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:26.289> it's<00:04:27.039> hard<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.370> do<00:04:27.550> this

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
of the realms and it's hard to do this

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:28.800 
of the realms and it's hard to do this
it's<00:04:28.000> hard<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.210> avoid<00:04:28.479> these<00:04:28.630> situations

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
it's hard to avoid these situations

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.779 
it's hard to avoid these situations
because<00:04:29.440> like<00:04:29.590> cami<00:04:30.039> will<00:04:30.220> lose<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.640> first

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
because like cami will lose the first

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.210 
because like cami will lose the first
round<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.630> then<00:04:31.840> gain<00:04:32.080> meter<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.620> then<00:04:32.800> make

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
round and then gain meter and then make

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.130 
round and then gain meter and then make
a<00:04:33.250> comeback<00:04:33.550> because<00:04:34.180> of<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.600> extraction

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
a comeback because of the extraction

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.929 
a comeback because of the extraction
leader<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.710> gain<00:04:35.830> greater<00:04:36.039> funny<00:04:36.340> yep
