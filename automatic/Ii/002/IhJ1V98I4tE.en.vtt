and the plan is in the corner and then

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
and the plan is in the corner and then
there's<00:01:50.969> also<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.240> print<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.140> wall<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.740> what

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
a disaster sorta now I've also done this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380 
a disaster sorta now I've also done this
and<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.459> see<00:02:11.519> I've<00:02:11.730> put<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.209> all

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and as you can see I've put and some all

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.360 
and as you can see I've put and some all
in<00:02:12.599> ones<00:02:12.870> now<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.069> don't

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
in ones now I know that they don't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.000 
in ones now I know that they don't
need<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> sink<00:02:15.060> because<00:02:15.739> everything's<00:02:16.739> covered

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
need a sink because everything's covered

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
need a sink because everything's covered
by<00:02:17.340> these<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.760> I'll<00:02:17.879> just<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.569> looks

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
by these but I'll just think it looks

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.309 
by these but I'll just think it looks
more<00:02:19.700> pleasing<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> eye<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
more pleasing to the eye to see it and

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.710 
more pleasing to the eye to see it and
I've<00:02:22.650> kinda<00:02:22.980> matched<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
I've kinda matched this with this and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.949 
I've kinda matched this with this and
also<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.099> these<00:02:26.220> wall<00:02:26.519> up<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.810> I've<00:02:27.930> got

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
also if I put these wall up and I've got

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.069 
also if I put these wall up and I've got
like<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.650> table<00:02:29.099> caddy<00:02:29.879> thing<00:02:30.299> here<00:02:30.599> so

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.160 
leads - I've decided upstairs because it
is<00:04:40.470> generally<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.550> hot<00:04:41.850> tone<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.870> we<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.140> a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
is generally a hot tone that we have a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.230 
is generally a hot tone that we have a
fill<00:04:43.530> roof<00:04:43.980> space<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.610> we<00:04:44.730> could<00:04:45.000> make

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
fill roof space that we could make

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.270 
fill roof space that we could make
yourself<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.750> know<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:46.080> we<00:04:46.170> do<00:04:46.350> have<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:47.250> know

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
yourself I know that we do have you know

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.710 
yourself I know that we do have you know
the<00:04:47.490> pool<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:47.940> everything<00:04:48.030> like<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.630> mean

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
the pool and everything like that I mean

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.660 
the pool and everything like that I mean
they<00:04:48.900> do<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.140> quite<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.620> nice<00:04:49.830> outside<00:04:50.370> space

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
they do have quite a nice outside space

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.070 
they do have quite a nice outside space
but<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.210> thought<00:04:51.330> it'd<00:04:51.420> be<00:04:51.450> quite<00:04:51.660> good<00:04:51.870> that

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
but I thought it'd be quite good that

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.590 
but I thought it'd be quite good that
could<00:04:52.170> have<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.590> table<00:04:52.830> barbecue<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:54.120> sort

could have like a table barbecue a sort
of<00:04:54.690> party<00:04:55.110> area<00:04:55.290> up<00:04:55.620> here<00:04:55.830> because<00:04:56.010> I<00:04:56.370> would

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
of party area up here because I would

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.460 
of party area up here because I would
really<00:04:56.970> like<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.330> see<00:04:57.870> if<00:04:57.960> my<00:04:58.200> house<00:04:58.440> was

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
really like that see if my house was

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.490 
really like that see if my house was
kina<00:04:58.920> here<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.660> I<00:05:00.660> could<00:05:00.870> go<00:05:01.020> up<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.320> roof

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
kina here and I could go up on the roof

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.950
