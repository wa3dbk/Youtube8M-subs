00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.490
 Means very big such a sense of 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 work here with these liquid media 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.130
 and everyone rushed here 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.199
 cool liquid media all bottles 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.480
 you pour it and nothing else 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.539
 everything must be done very simply and enchantingly 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.029
 but in fact there is another 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.580
 side of the coin that always pulkovo end 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.150
 how much easier it complicates things 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.699
 same time 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.899
 as easy here as well 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.960
 this complicates the topic itself because 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.300
 for working accordingly already with liquid 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.219
 Wednesdays need a little bit respectively 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 other lab conditions then i'm talking about 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.059
 those liquid media that are in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 vial 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 then technically spill them for example already 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
 there when mycelium sat down a little bit 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 it turns out not so easy and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 the result would seem to be this simplicity we 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.289
 get a place of simplification we get a lot 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.969
 marriage and everything else because for 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 this you need to have a good technique work 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.610
 for this you need to have a clean room and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.950
 and experience already work directly such 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.479
 lab with these tips this is me 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.020
 really say that I communicate with different 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.530
 users what I hear from them here 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.050
 and I got the impression that 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.970
 let's say 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.280
 liquid media this is not a panacea 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.930
 in general, such that we all come to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 liquid media we don't need anything else 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.110
 for everything for each mycelium 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.010
 has its place that is liquid medium 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.180
 it is for the same purposes we aim there syringe 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.770
 this other goals 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.650
 let's say so even a petri dish and a test tube 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.300
 need both one and the other because too 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.430
 sometimes they ask why then marriage 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.990
 cups if they are often infected can 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.670
 only test tubes do have things 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.270
 which is not possible only in vitro 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.090
 do you need a cup here let's say like this 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:04.310
 So I will answer the question so for liquid 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:06.020
 wednesday well such a difficult question is not all there 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 so everything is as simple as it seems at first 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.950
 sight 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.870
 so don't really need to run after it 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.390
 the main thing is to learn how to work with 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.970
 by any medium is another matter then 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.770
 already under each situation you will have 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.860
 opportunity technical or decide those 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.720
 or in some other way is another question itself 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.700
 liquid date can't do everything 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.100
 decide let's say fences of the same medium 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.160
 fraught but the greatest 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.220
 grease to infect it for this 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.190
 need a sterile vial here vial 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.200
 it needs to be selected a lot 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.290
 contact with the external environment again 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 such open this container here with 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.680
 Wednesday and then unknown what happens 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.739
 already in this environment if on the cup we 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.570
 for example, we clearly see growth, even 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.970
 the problem itself from working with liquid media 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.750
 on the test tube cup we clearly see it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.730
 mycelium grows 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.260
 it is their purpose grows it is a clean test tube 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.570
 it's infected it's thrown it 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.350
 left how do we know what is growing in 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.170
 liquid medium 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.670
 if we have our conditions there such 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.280
 pretty and let's say conditionally 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.250
 labs are not where massachusetts there 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 Institute of 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.430
 in capcom these these somewhere 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 mushroom cultivation 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.080
 let's say so applied that's where we come from 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.000
 we can know what grows in this bottle 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.600
 here in the bottle it looks like 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.520
 equally 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.250
 like something muddy there is there and what are we 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.470
 goals or their goals this will see through 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.530
 there are two three weeks of sowing already on the cup 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.570
 that's the answer to what a cup anywhere from them 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.550
 you canâ€™t say goodbye and you need cups of test tubes 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.970
 to visualize this material here and 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.190
 I honestly tell you of his eerie light 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.830
 time here I am fired up experimental 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.600
 made them but they went with me there 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.630
 in the fridge long box because 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.590
 But for myself personally, for production 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.880
 mycelium growing there everything else 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:05.420
 let's say i don't currently 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:08.420
 We use not what I switched 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.110
 that's what i'm doing i just keep 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.600
 liquid media and I mean the process 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.880
 making mycelium looks like 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.100
 in the way that is from the checked bottle 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.060
 I take cells cells grow on 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.550
 agar agar moves to jar from jar 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.140
 culture is grown 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.750
 Well, yes and canned that is half a liter 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.720
 let's say so with a half liter jar she 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.840
 moves to bag it turns out 0 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.910
 generating this bag further if there 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.560
 time allowed can do one more 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.600
 reseeding then it turns out the first generation 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.420
 If it does not allow, then it turns out 0 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.330
 generation he and sowing and further in 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.190
 no more generation is done 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.920
 because the farther these reseeding those 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.890
 more will be lost already right 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.530
 the cost of the mycelium of everything else so 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.800
 that is approximately how I will answer you 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.530
 to this question therefore 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.659
 here are all these works by their liquid media 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.610
 need to be carried out for general development and 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.500
 then when learn to work with them 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.629
 here then to conclude where and how you 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.120
 will use them and the method itself 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.009
 work with solid and staffing environments 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.900
 more than enough to 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.069
 provide 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:27.690
 you can even say huge enterprises 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:32.050
 mycelium and everything with a controversial typo 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.060
 Refugees and you here spore imprint 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.190
 sport signet he is a pair in print 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.000
 sealed it on paper then or there on 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.919
 foil is best done 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.430
 it turns out to bite trash can turn out 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:49.629
 from the external environment and infections there rather 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.909
 only factor thicker high yes of course but 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.860
 so definitely because well, how 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.580
 typos we make this mushroom to you yourself 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.460
 not sterile 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.080
 we can not its internet and 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.389
 sterilized put it on paper 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.719
 what is there on the foil that fell then this and 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.040
 dropped that is rowing there cup in 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:10.320
 Further, what if you're lucky 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.390
 the infection did not hit if the infection hit 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.920
 need a few passages to do while 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.970
 clean as far as it will work 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.930
 as far as this allows technology 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.670
 lab technician let's say that person who 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.480
 It works is another question as far as 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:27.390
 he can clean it is the easiest 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.700
 controversial imprint to be honest so 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.980
 I objectively understand all the difficulties of work 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.920
 In this direction, I honestly 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.150
 never started introducing 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.510
 mycelium and dispute ago 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.080
 Inna precisely prints another way 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.060
 if you get this culture from not so 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.009
 just from the first print i have 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.529
 good video fence 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.729
 dispute when the spur is just the flu itself 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:56.369
 for this you need to take a sterile environment 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.710
 small let's say or minimal 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:01.379
 Exposure under the cap when it is clear that 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.869
 well mushrooms so shoots the smoke you saw 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:08.699
 how the flu shoots these disputes and 

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:12.050
 line until you have seen well here when growing 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:15.149
 hanger here you are watching it starts 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.189
 That's about to like Dan so here's released 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.469
 these disputes are really visually visible and 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:21.300
 Now you can do something like this print 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:23.779
 a little bit different when the cup 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.610
 that time when this smoke went 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:28.589
 captured on a cup of these disputes 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.779
 it closes and is set like this 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:33.029
 the way I just caught absolutely 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:39.949
 there it is obtained from three four cups 1 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:39.949
 it turns out absolutely clean and that's it
