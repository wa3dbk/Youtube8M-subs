counterfeit cards and support them in
any<00:01:04.079> way<00:01:04.229> alright<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.399> the<00:01:05.519> first<00:01:05.729> test<00:01:05.970> we're

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
any way alright so the first test we're

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.370 
any way alright so the first test we're
going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.329> go<00:01:06.450> over<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> would

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going to go over is what I would

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.219 
going to go over is what I would
consider<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.950> most<00:01:08.100> extreme<00:01:08.909> test<00:01:09.389> and<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
consider the most extreme test and that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.160 
consider the most extreme test and that
is<00:01:10.469> the<00:01:11.069> ripped<00:01:11.369> test<00:01:11.759> which<00:01:12.329> is<00:01:12.509> quite<00:01:12.899> like

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is the ripped test which is quite like

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.139 
is the ripped test which is quite like
what<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> sounds<00:01:14.039> so<00:01:14.639> when<00:01:14.789> you<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:14.999> at<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
what it sounds so when you look at a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.489 
what it sounds so when you look at a
magic<00:01:15.329> card<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.929> a<00:01:15.960> front<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.469> back

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
magic card it's got a front and a back

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.359 
magic card it's got a front and a back
and<00:01:17.569> these<00:01:18.569> are<00:01:18.929> assumedly<00:01:19.649> printed

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and these are assumedly printed

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.109 
and these are assumedly printed
separately<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:22.289> a<00:01:22.649> glue<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.459> placed<00:01:23.819> between

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
separately then a glue is placed between

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.080 
separately then a glue is placed between
them<00:01:24.569> very<00:01:25.020> thinly<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:25.819> layers<00:01:26.819> are

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
them very thinly and the layers are

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
them very thinly and the layers are
pressed<00:01:27.329> together<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.929> and<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:29.429> glue<00:01:29.819> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
pressed together right and the glue that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.340 
pressed together right and the glue that
they<00:01:30.119> use<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.799> blue<00:01:32.399> um<00:01:32.959> or<00:01:33.959> at<00:01:34.049> least<00:01:34.229> that's

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
they use is blue um or at least that's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
they use is blue um or at least that's
that's<00:01:34.859> how<00:01:35.039> I<00:01:35.069> understand<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.209> so<00:01:36.359> when

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that's how I understand it and so when

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
that's how I understand it and so when
you<00:01:36.569> take<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.109> these<00:01:37.319> cards<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.069> you<00:01:38.670> rip

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you take one of these cards and you rip

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.620 
you take one of these cards and you rip
it<00:01:38.969> in<00:01:39.179> half<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.619> very<00:01:41.299> perfect<00:01:42.299> blue

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it in half you get a very perfect blue

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.830 
it in half you get a very perfect blue
line<00:01:42.929> right<00:01:43.289> along<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.740> RIP<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.569> put

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
line right along the RIP and that is put

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
line right along the RIP and that is put
there<00:01:46.020> specifically<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.740> wizards<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.520> tow

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
there specifically for wizards to tow

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
there specifically for wizards to tow
and<00:01:47.849> something<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.209> counterfeited<00:01:48.779> many

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and something is counterfeited many

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.749 
and something is counterfeited many
counterfeits<00:01:49.349> don't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.340> blue<00:01:50.549> line

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
counterfeits don't have the blue line

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.269 
counterfeits don't have the blue line
but<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.599> really<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.289> most<00:01:52.469> extreme

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:53.279 
but this is really the most extreme

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.209 
but this is really the most extreme
option<00:01:54.179> so<00:01:54.749> really<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.289> should<00:01:55.319> probably<00:01:55.740> be

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
option so really you should probably be

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
option so really you should probably be
bringing<00:01:56.459> a<00:01:56.759> card<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> head<00:01:57.810> judge

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
bringing a card to like a head judge

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
bringing a card to like a head judge
from<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> vendor<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.369> something<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.479> having

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
from a vendor or something and having

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.949 
from a vendor or something and having
him<00:02:01.020> rip<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:01.590> some<00:02:02.219> jazz<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.179> if<00:02:03.419> you

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
him rip it or some jazz like that if you

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.959 
him rip it or some jazz like that if you
just<00:02:04.200> barely<00:02:04.529> suspect<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.249> a<00:02:05.279> card<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.700> fake

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
just barely suspect that a card is fake

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.210 
just barely suspect that a card is fake
and<00:02:06.209> you<00:02:06.299> rip<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:06.749> that's<00:02:07.079> probably<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and you rip it that's probably not the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639 
and you rip it that's probably not the
best<00:02:08.250> plan<00:02:08.789> now<00:02:09.599> when<00:02:09.840> counterfeiters<00:02:10.500> are

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
best plan now when counterfeiters are

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
best plan now when counterfeiters are
making<00:02:11.099> cards<00:02:11.490> they<00:02:11.670> want<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> make<00:02:12.240> cards

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
making cards they want to make cards

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.690 
making cards they want to make cards
that<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:12.810> pricey<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.829> usually<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.400> don't<00:02:14.579> want

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that are pricey so usually we don't want

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.420 
that are pricey so usually we don't want
to<00:02:14.760> go<00:02:14.849> around<00:02:14.939> ripping<00:02:15.569> them<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.439> for<00:02:17.010> example

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to go around ripping them so for example

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.470 
to go around ripping them so for example
the<00:02:17.579> snap<00:02:17.819> caster

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the snap caster

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.260 
the snap caster
if<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.110> was<00:02:19.290> trading<00:02:19.770> for<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.490> wouldn't<00:02:21.150> just

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
if I was trading for it I wouldn't just

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.880 
if I was trading for it I wouldn't just
go<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.630> rip<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.110> would<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.530> some<00:02:22.709> other

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
go and rip it I would do some other

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.910 
go and rip it I would do some other
tests<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.959> well-known<00:02:25.140> tests<00:02:25.830> is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
tests so one of the well-known tests is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.270 
tests so one of the well-known tests is
called<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> bend<00:02:26.760> test<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> take<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
called the bend test so when you take a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.820 
called the bend test so when you take a
fake<00:02:29.670> card<00:02:30.060> many<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.020> them<00:02:31.170> won't<00:02:31.319> pass<00:02:31.590> this

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
fake card many of them won't pass this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.070 
fake card many of them won't pass this
test<00:02:32.069> which<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.180> take<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.630> two<00:02:33.660> sides

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
test which is you take the two sides

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.670 
test which is you take the two sides
like<00:02:34.200> this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
like this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.130 
like this
you<00:02:34.950> begin<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.670> bend<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.930> those<00:02:37.080> two

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
you begin to bend it and if those two

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.900 
you begin to bend it and if those two
edges<00:02:37.920> meet<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.840> undo<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.130> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
edges meet and you can undo it and it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.390 
edges meet and you can undo it and it
stays<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> normal<00:02:43.350> magic<00:02:43.680> card<00:02:43.890> with<00:02:44.070> no

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
stays like a normal magic card with no

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.050 
stays like a normal magic card with no
creases<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.050> very<00:02:46.410> likely<00:02:46.860> real<00:02:47.370> it's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
creases then it's very likely real it's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150 
creases then it's very likely real it's
very<00:02:48.390> hard<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.020> make<00:02:49.170> these<00:02:49.350> cards<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.980> are

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
very hard to make these cards that are

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.060 
very hard to make these cards that are
so<00:02:50.430> thin<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.720> cardboard<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.560> won't

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
so thin out of cardboard that won't

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.340 
so thin out of cardboard that won't
retain<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> crease<00:02:54.000> after<00:02:54.270> such<00:02:54.750> extreme

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
retain a crease after such extreme

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.380 
retain a crease after such extreme
bending<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.250> need<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.670> high-quality

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
bending really need to have high-quality

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.620 
bending really need to have high-quality
materials<00:02:57.989> which<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:58.980> Wizards<00:02:59.430> uses<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
materials which is what Wizards uses so

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.259 
materials which is what Wizards uses so
let's<00:03:00.900> take<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.320> snap<00:03:01.620> caster<00:03:02.130> age<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.640> show

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
let's take this snap caster age and show

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.910 
let's take this snap caster age and show
you<00:03:03.330> guys<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.930> bend<00:03:04.110> test<00:03:04.350> looks<00:03:04.709> like

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
you guys what the bend test looks like

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.890 
you guys what the bend test looks like
now<00:03:05.580> there<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.910> one<00:03:06.120> problem<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.720> bend

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
now there is one problem with the bend

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.780 
now there is one problem with the bend
test<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.320> makes<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> less<00:03:07.860> than<00:03:08.070> ideal<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
test that makes it less than ideal and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.090 
test that makes it less than ideal and
that<00:03:09.330> problem<00:03:09.750> has<00:03:09.900> been<00:03:10.110> stated<00:03:10.380> by<00:03:10.650> Wizards

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
that problem has been stated by Wizards

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.949 
that problem has been stated by Wizards
which<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.550> card<00:03:11.910> will<00:03:12.060> only<00:03:12.300> past<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.780> bend

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
which is a card will only past the bend

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.370 
which is a card will only past the bend
test<00:03:13.220> between<00:03:14.269> eight<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.900> twelve<00:03:16.230> times

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
test between eight to twelve times

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.640 
test between eight to twelve times
before<00:03:17.280> finally<00:03:17.550> folding<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.050> piece<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
before finally folding it is a piece of

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.979 
before finally folding it is a piece of
paper<00:03:19.830> after<00:03:20.370> all<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.209> if<00:03:21.300> you're<00:03:21.330> trading<00:03:21.660> for

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
paper after all so if you're trading for

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.479 
paper after all so if you're trading for
something<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> piece<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.980> power<00:03:23.190> nine

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
something like a piece of power nine

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.940 
something like a piece of power nine
that's<00:03:23.760> gone<00:03:23.970> through<00:03:24.209> many<00:03:24.510> Bend<00:03:24.810> tests<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
that's gone through many Bend tests the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's gone through many Bend tests the
bend<00:03:26.190> test<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.700> probably<00:03:27.420> not<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.019> want

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
bend test is probably not what you want

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.589 
bend test is probably not what you want
to<00:03:28.290> go<00:03:28.470> for

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.630 

our<00:03:32.900> last<00:03:33.260> method<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.189> least<00:03:34.430> invasive

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
our last method is the least invasive

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.899 
our last method is the least invasive
and<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.109> called<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.469> light<00:03:36.769> test<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:37.639> all

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
and that is called the light test so all

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.289 
and that is called the light test so all
you<00:03:38.060> need<00:03:38.239> really<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.930> foam<00:03:39.769> because<00:03:40.670> you've

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
you need really is a foam because you've

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.539 
you need really is a foam because you've
got<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.569> little<00:03:41.749> flash<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.129> so<00:03:43.430> if<00:03:43.489> you

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
got a little flash in here and so if you

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.069 
got a little flash in here and so if you
get<00:03:43.639> a<00:03:43.700> flashlight<00:03:43.969> app<00:03:44.420> then<00:03:44.659> you<00:03:44.749> can<00:03:44.930> turn

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
get a flashlight app then you can turn

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.170 
get a flashlight app then you can turn
that<00:03:45.139> on<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.739> you're<00:03:46.400> going<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.609> pass<00:03:46.879> the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180

of the card

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.289 
of the card
using<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:15.469> light<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:16.489> is<00:04:16.669> very<00:04:16.910> easy<00:04:17.180> to

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
using the light this is very easy to

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.819 
using the light this is very easy to
pick<00:04:17.539> out<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.079> can<00:04:18.289> see<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.650> it's

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
pick out and you can see that it's

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.979 
pick out and you can see that it's
consistent<00:04:19.430> all<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.699> way<00:04:20.180> across<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.720> card

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
consistent all the way across the card

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.659 
consistent all the way across the card
but<00:04:21.440> what<00:04:21.620> does<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.799> counterfeit<00:04:22.310> look<00:04:22.460> like

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
but what does a counterfeit look like

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.999 
but what does a counterfeit look like
under<00:04:22.940> these<00:04:23.120> conditions<00:04:23.720> well<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.770> first

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
under these conditions well the first

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.150 
under these conditions well the first
thing<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.699> it<00:04:25.820> might<00:04:26.030> pass<00:04:26.389> less<00:04:27.229> or<00:04:27.530> more

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
thing is that it might pass less or more

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.150 
thing is that it might pass less or more
light<00:04:28.639> than<00:04:28.970> usual<00:04:29.449> and<00:04:29.750> if<00:04:30.530> that's<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.889> case

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
light than usual and if that's the case

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.710 
light than usual and if that's the case
when<00:04:31.490> you're<00:04:31.610> comparing<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.300> regular

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
when you're comparing it to a regular

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.719 
when you're comparing it to a regular
card<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.560> can<00:04:33.740> tell<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.070> it's<00:04:34.220> counterfeit

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
card you can tell that it's counterfeit

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.629 
card you can tell that it's counterfeit
another<00:04:35.570> thing<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:35.990> shows<00:04:36.169> up<00:04:36.229> often<00:04:37.039> is

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
another thing that shows up often is

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.270 
another thing that shows up often is
that<00:04:37.669> that<00:04:38.419> blue<00:04:38.780> layer<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:39.349> adhesive<00:04:40.039> layer

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
that that blue layer that adhesive layer

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.020 
that that blue layer that adhesive layer
is<00:04:40.580> very<00:04:41.300> splotchy<00:04:41.990> in<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:43.280> counterfeit<00:04:43.880> and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
is very splotchy in the counterfeit and

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.240 
is very splotchy in the counterfeit and
the<00:04:44.389> reason<00:04:44.690> why<00:04:44.840> is<00:04:44.900> because<00:04:45.250> Wizards

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
the reason why is because Wizards

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.969 
the reason why is because Wizards
applies<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:47.210> very<00:04:47.599> perfectly<00:04:48.229> thin<00:04:48.680> layer<00:04:48.949> of

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
applies a very perfectly thin layer of

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.760 
applies a very perfectly thin layer of
glue<00:04:49.460> whereas<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.300> counterfeiters<00:04:50.810> do<00:04:51.500> not

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
glue whereas the counterfeiters do not

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.189 
glue whereas the counterfeiters do not
and<00:04:52.099> so<00:04:52.159> they<00:04:52.550> make<00:04:52.729> little<00:04:52.940> pools<00:04:53.330> when<00:04:54.080> they

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
and so they make little pools when they

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.710 
and so they make little pools when they
do<00:04:54.259> that<00:04:54.650> your<00:04:55.130> light<00:04:55.370> shows<00:04:55.820> where<00:04:56.570> the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
do that your light shows where the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.110 
do that your light shows where the
little<00:04:56.900> globs<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.650> glue<00:04:57.919> are<00:04:58.130> because<00:04:58.849> of<00:04:58.880> how

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
little globs of glue are because of how

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.909 
little globs of glue are because of how
sensitive<00:04:59.539> your<00:04:59.750> eyes<00:04:59.930> are<00:05:00.169> to<00:05:00.409> light<00:05:00.620> and

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
sensitive your eyes are to light and

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.249 
sensitive your eyes are to light and
because<00:05:01.699> of<00:05:01.729> how<00:05:02.000> well<00:05:02.270> made<00:05:02.449> a<00:05:02.479> magic<00:05:02.690> card<00:05:03.110> is

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
because of how well made a magic card is

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.740 
because of how well made a magic card is
you<00:05:04.009> can<00:05:04.250> tell<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.550> counterfeit<00:05:05.180> card<00:05:05.360> very
