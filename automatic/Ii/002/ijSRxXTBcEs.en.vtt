while you get salt rifles or SMGs
there's<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.229> different<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:29.150> things

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
there's a lot of different one things

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
there's a lot of different one things
you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> shotgun<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.650> there's<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you can do with a shotgun and there's a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can do with a shotgun and there's a
lot<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> different<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.909> game<00:01:32.970> things<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
lot of different in game things to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.090 
lot of different in game things to
actually<00:01:34.259> help<00:01:34.829> your<00:01:35.579> shotgun<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.299> better<00:01:37.100> one

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
actually help your shotgun do better one

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
actually help your shotgun do better one
example<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.600> extended<00:01:40.170> mags<00:01:40.380> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
example would be the extended mags I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
example would be the extended mags I
guess<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> could<00:01:41.340> say<00:01:41.490> glitch<00:01:41.869> what<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> does

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
guess you could say glitch what it does

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
guess you could say glitch what it does
is<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.470> makes<00:01:43.740> makes<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.939> your

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
is it makes makes it so that your

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
is it makes makes it so that your
shotgun<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.689> shoots<00:01:45.960> fifty<00:01:46.380> percent<00:01:46.680> more

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
shotgun and shoots fifty percent more

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
shotgun and shoots fifty percent more
pellets<00:01:47.189> than<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.030> does<00:01:48.240> originally<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.960> let's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
pellets than it does originally so let's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.399 
pellets than it does originally so let's
say<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.360> have<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> striker<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:52.170> shoots

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
say you have the striker which shoots

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.149 
say you have the striker which shoots
six<00:01:53.070> pellets<00:01:53.490> per<00:01:53.759> shelf<00:01:54.710> she<00:01:55.710> put<00:01:55.860> extend

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
six pellets per shelf she put extend

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.830 
six pellets per shelf she put extend
mags<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.770> shoots<00:01:58.770> nine<00:01:59.280> which

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
mags on it it shoots nine which

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.980 
mags on it it shoots nine which
basically<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.259> acts<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.829> stopping<00:02:02.399> power

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
basically it acts as like stopping power

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
basically it acts as like stopping power
which<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.170> why<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> striker<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.369> want

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
which is why with the striker you want

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.229 
which is why with the striker you want
to<00:02:05.610> put<00:02:05.759> range<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> post<00:02:06.750> damage<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
to put range on as a post damage so that

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.820 
to put range on as a post damage so that
you<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.569> range<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.500> striker

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you get more range with it the striker

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.480

it doesn't have any attachments you want

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.900 
it doesn't have any attachments you want

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
to use the damage proficiency so that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.510 
to use the damage proficiency so that
you<00:02:22.060> get<00:02:22.180> more<00:02:22.390> damage<00:02:22.840> because<00:02:23.650> really<00:02:23.890> what

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
you get more damage because really what

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.610 
you get more damage because really what
you<00:02:24.670> want<00:02:24.880> with<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> model<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.660> one<00:02:26.350> shot

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
you want with the model is one shot

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.280 
you want with the model is one shot
kills<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.190> opposed<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.850> range<00:02:28.090> which<00:02:28.900> even

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
kills as opposed to range which even

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.900 
kills as opposed to range which even
with<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.530> damage<00:02:29.740> proficiency<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.610> still

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
with the damage proficiency it still

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.390 
with the damage proficiency it still
gets<00:02:31.090> extremely<00:02:31.570> good<00:02:31.810> range<00:02:32.080> since<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
gets extremely good range since the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.070 
gets extremely good range since the
damage<00:02:33.730> for<00:02:33.910> fish<00:02:34.060> see<00:02:34.360> what<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.750> does<00:02:34.870> is

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
damage for fish see what it does is

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.110 
damage for fish see what it does is
basically<00:02:35.260> makes<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.430> one<00:02:36.850> less

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
basically makes it so that one less

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.670 
basically makes it so that one less
pellet<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.690> required<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.560> kill<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:40.470> area<00:02:41.470> said

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
pellet is required to kill so area said

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.020 
pellet is required to kill so area said
earlier<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:43.420> model<00:02:43.840> needs<00:02:44.520> with<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.640> damage

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
earlier the model needs with that damage

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.960 
earlier the model needs with that damage
needs<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:46.930> pellets<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.530> kill<00:02:47.740> but<00:02:48.580> with

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
needs for pellets to kill but with

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.500 
needs for pellets to kill but with
damage<00:02:49.480> only<00:02:49.660> needs<00:02:49.960> three<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:51.190> really<00:02:52.180> you're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
damage only needs three so really you're

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.580 
damage only needs three so really you're
both<00:02:52.870> increasing<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.710> effective<00:02:54.160> range<00:02:54.400> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
both increasing the effective range and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
both increasing the effective range and
the<00:02:56.590> probability<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.310> getting<00:02:57.550> one<00:02:57.940> shot<00:02:58.210> kill

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the probability of getting one shot kill

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.060 
the probability of getting one shot kill
with<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.810> which<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.440> why<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.620> want<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.950> use
