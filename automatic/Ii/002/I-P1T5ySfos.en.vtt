some<00:01:45.509> pads<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.079> shut<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.560> come<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
some pads like shut will come with it I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.249 
some pads like shut will come with it I
know<00:01:47.670> some<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.210> results<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.780> come<00:01:49.049> with

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
know some of the results don't come with

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.749 
know some of the results don't come with
the<00:01:49.439> extra<00:01:49.829> pads<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> raise<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the extra pads to raise them up I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.120 
the extra pads to raise them up I
removed<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> pad

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
removed them here so if you have a pad

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.149 
removed them here so if you have a pad
like<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.729> provides<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.329> protection

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
like this it provides more protection

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.679 
like this it provides more protection
well<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> five<00:01:56.430> pad<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.240> raises<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
well the five pad because it raises it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.190 
well the five pad because it raises it
up<00:01:57.869> off<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.079> your<00:01:58.439> AC<00:01:58.710> joint<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> like

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to take them out because sometimes the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
to take them out because sometimes the
shoulder<00:02:04.170> pad<00:02:04.320> will<00:02:04.530> interfere<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.070> your

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
shoulder pad will interfere with your

flat as possible so I give up a little

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.050 
flat as possible so I give up a little
of<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:10.050> protection<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.819> taking<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.910> on

of that protection there taking it on

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
of that protection there taking it on
and<00:02:12.239> off<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.230> be<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> little<00:02:13.530> bit<00:02:13.650> too

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and off this can be a little bit too

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.220 
and off this can be a little bit too
hold<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.120> easy<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.660> once<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.990> shirt

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
hold on is easy but once the shirt

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
hold on is easy but once the shirt
really<00:02:16.410> gets<00:02:16.650> wet<00:02:16.920> soaked<00:02:17.400> with<00:02:17.580> sweat<00:02:17.870> it's
