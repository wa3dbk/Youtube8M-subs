get one just with a saw I'll just sawed

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.200 
get one just with a saw I'll just sawed
it<00:00:27.240> off<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.020> about<00:00:28.760> six<00:00:29.760> inches<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> day

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it off so it's about six inches a day

for five or six inches date with no with
a<00:00:32.219> screwdriver<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.910> punch<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> few<00:00:33.270> holes<00:00:33.480> in

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:34.609 
a screwdriver just punch a few holes in

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.309 
a screwdriver just punch a few holes in
but<00:00:35.609> you<00:00:35.699> can<00:00:35.789> see<00:00:35.999> it<00:00:36.390> holds<00:00:36.659> a<00:00:36.690> lot<00:00:36.809> more<00:00:36.870> soil

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:37.319 
but you can see it holds a lot more soil

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.309 
but you can see it holds a lot more soil
enough<00:00:37.710> depth<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.909> a<00:00:38.969> enormous<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.629> trace<00:00:40.019> or

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:40.319 
enough depth and a enormous a trace or

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.469 
enough depth and a enormous a trace or
so<00:00:41.309> once<00:00:41.489> you've<00:00:41.609> sold<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.149> planted

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:42.479 
so once you've sold them and planted

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.629 
so once you've sold them and planted
them<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:43.499> will<00:00:43.649> grow<00:00:44.159> on<00:00:44.339> they're<00:00:44.550> not

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:44.639 
them they will grow on they're not

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:46.309 
them they will grow on they're not
better<00:00:44.819> in<00:00:45.030> soybean<00:00:45.749> don't<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> pick<00:00:46.229> them

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:46.319 
better in soybean don't you to pick them

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.939 
better in soybean don't you to pick them
out<00:00:46.440> again<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:48.199> then<00:00:49.199> once<00:00:49.350> you've<00:00:49.559> filled<00:00:49.799> you

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
out again so then once you've filled you

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.520 
out again so then once you've filled you
build<00:00:50.549> it<00:00:50.639> would<00:00:50.789> come<00:00:50.940> fast<00:00:51.210> dry<00:00:52.139> water<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
build it would come fast dry water it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.549 
build it would come fast dry water it
before<00:00:52.799> I<00:00:53.129> put<00:00:53.639> the<00:00:53.729> scenes<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.379> it's<00:00:55.379> just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
before I put the scenes up it's just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
before I put the scenes up it's just
simply<00:00:55.889> a<00:00:55.920> lesser<00:00:56.249> getting<00:00:56.999> your<00:00:57.089> league<00:00:57.239> sage

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
simply a lesser getting your league sage

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.899 
simply a lesser getting your league sage
and<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:59.269> broadcasting<00:01:00.269> them<00:01:00.389> evenly<00:01:01.909> all

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
and just broadcasting them evenly all

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:09.039 
and just broadcasting them evenly all
over<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.209> surface

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.219 

so<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.680> lot<00:01:09.860> more<00:01:10.070> than<00:01:10.159> enable<00:01:10.549> then<00:01:10.700> what's<00:01:10.880> if

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
so a lot more than enable then what's if

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.830 
so a lot more than enable then what's if
germinated<00:01:12.229> then<00:01:12.380> he<00:01:12.470> just<00:01:12.650> thin<00:01:12.860> them<00:01:13.010> out<00:01:13.840> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
germinated then he just thin them out to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.550 
germinated then he just thin them out to
about<00:01:15.850> an<00:01:16.850> inch<00:01:17.119> apart<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.900> can<00:01:17.930> easily

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
about an inch apart and you can easily

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.630 
about an inch apart and you can easily
grow<00:01:18.920> 50<00:01:19.310> leeks<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:21.009> without<00:01:22.009> any<00:01:22.220> any

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
grow 50 leeks in this without any any

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:35.889 
grow 50 leeks in this without any any
trouble<00:01:23.000> at<00:01:23.090> all<00:01:27.759> because<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.030> depth<00:01:34.899> of

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
trouble at all because of the depth of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.639 
trouble at all because of the depth of
soil<00:01:37.000> you'll<00:01:38.000> be<00:01:38.210> you'll<00:01:39.110> never<00:01:39.259> get<00:01:39.470> them<00:01:39.619> to

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
soil you'll be you'll never get them to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.080 
soil you'll be you'll never get them to
dry<00:01:39.979> out<00:01:40.159> because<00:01:40.310> it's<00:01:40.610> something<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.940> grow

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
dry out because it's something you grow

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.639 
dry out because it's something you grow
them<00:01:41.240> in<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.330> sea<00:01:41.509> trip<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.289> there's<00:01:42.410> only<00:01:42.530> an

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
them in a sea trip and there's only an

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.080 
them in a sea trip and there's only an
inch<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.890> soil<00:01:43.039> I'd<00:01:43.580> ever<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.820> day<00:01:43.940> in<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
inch of soil I'd ever the day in the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.090 
inch of soil I'd ever the day in the
greenhouse<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.470> drivers<00:01:45.800> cut<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
greenhouse it can have drivers cut the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.469 
greenhouse it can have drivers cut the
stock<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.520> dried<00:01:46.700> out<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:46.970> will<00:01:47.270> turn

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
stock and it dried out and will turn

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.450 
stock and it dried out and will turn
everything<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.619> way<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:48.830> won't<00:01:49.100> I've<00:01:49.310> done

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
everything so this way I won't I've done

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.820 
everything so this way I won't I've done
it<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.610> last<00:01:49.670> few<00:01:49.850> years<00:01:50.259> get<00:01:51.259> really<00:01:51.619> strong

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
it the last few years get really strong

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.889 
it the last few years get really strong
leaks<00:01:52.070> by<00:01:52.340> about<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.060> end<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.270> May<00:01:53.420> about<00:01:53.720> that

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
leaks by about the end of May about that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.880 
leaks by about the end of May about that
soft<00:01:54.200> ideal<00:01:54.679> for<00:01:54.830> planting<00:01:55.160> out<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.770> it's<00:01:57.770> just

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
soft ideal for planting out so it's just

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.610 
soft ideal for planting out so it's just
also<00:01:58.460> do
