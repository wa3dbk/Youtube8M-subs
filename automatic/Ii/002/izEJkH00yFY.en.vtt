00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
under 50 bucks this handles quite a bit

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.770 
under 50 bucks this handles quite a bit
of<00:02:06.010> weight<00:02:06.130> if<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.430> saw<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.910> ammo<00:02:07.300> case<00:02:07.540> that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
of weight if you saw that ammo case that

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.749 
of weight if you saw that ammo case that
I<00:02:07.810> was<00:02:08.020> rotating<00:02:08.530> around<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:09.070> weighs<00:02:09.610> about

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
I was rotating around that weighs about

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.390 
I was rotating around that weighs about
19<00:02:10.509> pounds<00:02:11.050> didn't<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.650> any<00:02:11.890> problems

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
19 pounds didn't have any problems

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.610 
19 pounds didn't have any problems
moving<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.940> smoothly<00:02:13.420> although<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> probably

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
moving that smoothly although I probably

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.020 
moving that smoothly although I probably
should<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.040> put<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.580> level<00:02:15.880> surface

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
should have put it on a level surface

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.090 
should have put it on a level surface
the<00:02:16.900> only<00:02:16.959> thing<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.350> would<00:02:17.530> say<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.010> you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
the only thing I would say that you

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.460

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
might need to add to this is a piece of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.949 
might need to add to this is a piece of
felt<00:02:20.890> over<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.370> top<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.600> isn't

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959
