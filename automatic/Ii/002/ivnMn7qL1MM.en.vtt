00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 the apparent angular size of the object is the angle 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.480
 under which we see this subject 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.579
 items of different sizes may have 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.659
 same angular size 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.700
 the sun is 400 times the moon but it is 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:44.700
 400 times further away from us by whom the moon 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.240
 so they are visible to the earth at one angle 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.530
 and during a solar eclipse the moon is exactly 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.110
 closes the sun is useful to remember 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.090
 visible angular size of the sun and moon 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.090
 is half a degree 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.080
 the closer to us the subject under 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.580
 the angle we see it and the smaller details 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 which we can distinguish 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 however when the subject is approaching the eye 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.690
 less than 15 centimeters 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 the eye can no longer focus on it 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.980
 and the image is blurred and here on 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.680
 help comes magnifying lens with not much 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.110
 focal length through a magnifier we see 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.590
 such details of which the naked eye 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.009
 can not see 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 we shall understand how the subject of the navel 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.090
 fits a little closer and and front 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.570
 focus 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.399
 at the same time the imaginary enlarged image 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.520
 the subject is located 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.679
 far beyond focus 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.390
 at such an eye distance well 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.300
 focuses and sees a clear image 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.850
 if you take the subject at a distance 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.800
 the best vision is its angular size 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.600
 will be much less 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.350
 angular size built 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350
 Images 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.500
 focal length 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.989
 magnifying glass is equal to 7 centimeters dividing 25 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640
 centimeters by 7 centimeters we get 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.120
 an increase of three and a half times 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.330
 indicated otherwise and we will check it on 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.780
 experience 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.800
 one strip with thin strokes 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.440
 installed at such a distance from 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.880
 camera to her image was 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.980
 sharp touches while almost indistinguishable 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.100
 The second such strip is completely 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.690
 close to the camera her image 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.790
 large but blurred 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.080
 insert between the second bar and 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.200
 camera magnifier 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.519
 now the strokes are perfectly visible 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.500
 comparing the visible widths of both strips 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.460
 make sure the magnifier really gives 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.400
 an increase of three and a half times 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.530
 so that the magnifier would give a big increase 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 it is necessary that she herself as possible 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.800
 less 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.200
 just such lenses learned 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.830
 to make the Dutch scientist Anton 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.680
 van leeuwenhoek 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.210
 levenguk lenses were less than one 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.750
 millimeter and gave an increase of 300 times 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.420
 looking through a lens like a drop of water 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.410
 Leeuwenhoek opened a whole world 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.470
 microscopic living things 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.000
 hitherto unknown to people from the pattern 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.000
 bacteria fire 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.020
 but
