00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
they will get to your spawn so we have

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.200 
they will get to your spawn so we have
the<00:01:31.650> advantage<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.100> here<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.909> notice

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the advantage over here and you notice

the advantage over here and you notice
you're<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.689> their<00:01:33.869> spawn<00:01:34.110> within<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> first

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you're in their spawn within the first

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
you're in their spawn within the first
15<00:01:35.070> seconds<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> round<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.170> go

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
15 seconds of the round so here we go

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
15 seconds of the round so here we go
with<00:01:37.439> another<00:01:37.470> rush<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.939> opposing<00:01:39.240> side

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
with another rush on the opposing side

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
with another rush on the opposing side
is<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.229> similar<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> first<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.130> but

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
is very similar to the first one but

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
is very similar to the first one but
instead<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.729> running<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> room<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
instead of running in the room to the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780
