00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:23.169
 She looks at my head, she opens it. 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.169
 walks 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.529
 Good Morning 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.070
 said if I'm different with a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.270
 true icon of the world of science 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.690
 it is american medco great north 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.710
 scholar of physiology and author of the book 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.770
 treaty of medical physiology that is already 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.989
 in its 12th edition 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 I'm talking about abu gayton 11h tone is a 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:06.729
 Great pleasure to receive you in my studio. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:09.430
 have today I will address in the interview a 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.460
 of his major studies within the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.409
 physiology that is the propagation of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.210
 action potential 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.330
 I wanted you to explain a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 little for the show the ego is clear 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.590
 how does it work 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:37.720
 it is not an electric wave leading 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.840
 information from the neurons to other 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:02:07.090
 tissues as initiates of potential of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:02:10.709
 action takes place but what would you 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.790
 call the map all 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.310
 when the bial is wrong it runs through 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.349
 the Ghana when it reaches a region of 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:29.730
 membrane that was not sufficient next 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.730
 the potential interrupts but is an event is 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:39.430
 wow that's three difficult to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.650
 but now explain to us the best 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.870
 phases of the action potential 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:50.830
 The first step is the membrane that 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:56.310
 the positive charges on the blog and 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:01.569
 repairs are inactivated and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.680
 come back to standstill occurs in all 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.980
 the cells 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.290
 but when the oil and gas boxes 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.870
 fashion and potassium continue 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.870
 open as potassium locks 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.099
 potential hassan in cells 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.200
 cardiac 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.260
 the phase of pator that are successive 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.150
 gains and legs of positive energy 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.680
 there is no change in the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 junior potential 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.099
 Guyton there are two expressions that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.310
 often confuse students with many 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.489
 are absolute and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.379
 relative so we do not have more doubts 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.790
 clarify this for our students 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:51.630
 and an active teacher is open is 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:51.630
 receive a new absolute stimulus 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.639
 is closed 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:18.729
 in the answer you are a genius as is 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:22.769
 that stimulus propagation occurs 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.769
 in neurons 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.750
 the magnification from above now let's do 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.400
 a hit and run game 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.430
 ping point i say the theme and lord me 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.180
 tells in a nutshell what comes in the 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.140
 head on this topic then fine then 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:17.100
 come on 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:32.940
 It's a family dream, it 's a striking feature. 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:35.490
 in the personality of a very 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.580
 Thank you, gayton, I do not have the words. 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.820
 to thank the Lord's presence 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.790
 It's really a great honor to talk to 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.930
 the greatest idol of physiology I am 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.200
 thrilled 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:54.450
 Thank you, it was a super interview. 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.260
 but before closing I would like to 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.590
 send a special kiss to the 35th 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.990
 medical class from the one in 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.790
 prudent president who is here in 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.690
 audience 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:13.730
 thank you very much and also a burden to the 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:22.140
 professors ana paula o rosan gela and 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:24.380
 sister production as is the difficult name of 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.380
 to pronounce 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.170
 thanks for the audience and the company 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.180
 see you at the next front with gabi 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.850
 interviewing as one Gayton 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.780
 great personality of all time 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.120
 the melon woman now have a video that 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.020
 is jumping on the internet 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.020
 a big kiss 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:58.900
 okay okay okay good 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:21.400
 the girl 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:21.400
 but she will continue 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.400
 close your mouth 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:40.110
 depend on us 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.110
 the team got 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:58.210
 or elp 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:58.210
 i call
