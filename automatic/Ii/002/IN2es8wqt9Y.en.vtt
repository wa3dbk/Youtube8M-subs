TV is a new game it's about finding the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.940 
TV is a new game it's about finding the
content<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> time<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:10.050> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> watch<00:00:10.500> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
and I think this is really the challenge

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.410 
and I think this is really the challenge
to<00:00:15.750> find<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:16.320> user<00:00:16.619> experience<00:00:17.000> that<00:00:18.000> attracts

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
to find a user experience that attracts

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.290 
to find a user experience that attracts
people<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.109> buy<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> service<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> that's<00:00:21.000> why

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
people to buy the service and that's why

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.689 
people to buy the service and that's why
it's<00:00:21.449> important<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> conduct<00:00:22.699> consumer

it's important to conduct consumer
research<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.420> that's<00:00:24.779> why<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.650> consumer

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
research and that's why we have consumer

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
research and that's why we have consumer
lab<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.090> find<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.869> customers<00:00:28.439> all<00:00:28.680> over
