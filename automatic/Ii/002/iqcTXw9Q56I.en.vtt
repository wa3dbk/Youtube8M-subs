00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 the family will come to traction 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 She turned to us for her 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 So here we see a big problem with 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.380
 her young man yes how the sleeping 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.910
 is called jana and this very impetuously both 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.890
 at the welcome so while walking 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 jana has a lot of energy and that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 It also intends to live it out 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.859
 miss rosmarie amount must keep up 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.859
 whether she likes it or not 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 favorite activity of the young bitch 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.489
 is it to welcome human friends 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.489
 as here neighbors Svetlana ilic 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:11.780
 who better you could retrieve them better 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.640
 so she can probably be me but play 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.119
 then that would work best 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.170
 it does not work right away 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.960
 go on 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 the whispering lauermann accompanies the woman 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 you are tragic and diana at her 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.240
 walk 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.520
 anyone I go away as you can see 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 it's not the excitement of 205 it's good 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 where exactly so good when he leashed 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.320
 he does not come to others anymore 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 Dogs can gamble with others 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.979
 it will come once but who tubes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 that is very clear for the dog too 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.790
 on a leash I go with women 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
 walk without a leash but I do something 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.990
 I want her dog a lot easier 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.040
 if it is so disconnected then i can 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.750
 really a stone okay now i have 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.789
 the leash of others I have to go though 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.289
 sometimes it does not run sometimes 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.050
 very difficult for the dog to assess 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.910
 because now start with the first exercise 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.739
 that is an attention noise 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.150
 then make the noise look 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.860
 Dog her on that is easy 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.330
 he fetches the iab from everything 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.830
 what all around damaged 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.900
 Another dog is people passing by 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 there really everything looked at 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.800
 and with that sound if you just 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.720
 the dog came to himself again 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.340
 then he will draw less around too 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.260
 is simply common to them 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.090
 walk 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.610
 if now the noise to train 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.769
 in the beginning they were just going to be fast and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.420
 delete immediately so give a lot of six times 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.070
 one after the other the dog only 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.829
 linked to this noise has one 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.440
 meaning there I get something great 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.060
 They have it just like that 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 it's easy to do the rest 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.850
 loud enough to click it and that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:55.350
 even higher reward already give the 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.000
 first time that the reward is pretty 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.640
 comes quickly because the dog still knows 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.350
 not what that means then really 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.209
 noise and immediately afterwards he gets 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.620
 the reward that cluck instantly 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.620
 Rewarding can also be very good 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.470
 important is not to pull on a leash 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.040
 and the dog also not with the name 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.410
 call 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.850
 the attention noise is enough and 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.840
 the leckerlis should with the time 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.390
 become less 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.450
 Diana seems to understand the principle too 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.450
 to have 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.700
 time to respond to the noise 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.500
 return 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.090
 but it is ideal for the dog getting lost 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 always with a shorter lay so 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.930
 do not go with the flex sailors 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.909
 with a shorter long always accurate 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.379
 The dog can spend a lot of time 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.340
 to judge better how long is that 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.349
 how long can I go on basis 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.069
 His dogs were for hunting 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.530
 cultured 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:01.290
 family knew that amount before buying 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:03.150
 not and of course it is 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 instructed to look at everything 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.090
 that did not miss 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.189
 you really have to see moves 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.200
 something could be a deer or not 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.389
 this hounds are very looking 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.340
 Much too that is nervous often comes from 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.510
 hunting and you can not just like that 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.370
 Off 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.680
 the federation must have the possibility 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.419
 to live out this hunter and there 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.210
 We can do a lot with tricks about 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.000
 nose work tracking that dog 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.229
 can keep himself as if he were hunting 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 but we call that only on command 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:37.139
 to use diana and thus quieter 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.849
 nose work recommends doing that 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.210
 train the two in family up 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:46.860
 Trucks make garden for their hunt 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.449
 to be able to satisfy the dog 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.099
 Must look for the nose 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.389
 that is has to work super head 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.190
 considering where I was I 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.949
 already searched and really the nose will 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.889
 Just like the dog 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.900
 really looking for food 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.300
 rosemarie distributed to dianas by day 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.580
 Augen leckerlis is important in the garden 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.909
 to seek the animal until it is not 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.909
 wants more 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.669
 can you imagine that the dog 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.970
 so his energy can channel yes 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:25.870
 I think so because advertised work 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:28.490
 exhausting because you are currently running 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.680
 after that, even the welcome of 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.620
 hans to truck are more relaxed 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.990
 here also antic at the welcome the 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.340
 hand down and initially 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.650
 reward with leckerlis 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.660
 then the dog will soon be down voluntarily 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.940
 stay if the animal is his breed 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.440
 is busy it will be 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.440
 also be quieter in everyday life
