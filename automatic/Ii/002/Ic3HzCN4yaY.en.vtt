00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.040
 to hobbies 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.730
 hi commenting for the channel and good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.590
 Many people told me to upload a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 video of my statistics so here the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 I bring gentlemen first thing I'm going to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
 show you a little bit of history 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 of combat the first thing you will see is 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.490
 the race as you see I am prestigious 7 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.110
 level 40 pass the other day of prestige 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.430
 because I did not make a bet and I said 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.800
 Hey, well I'm going to pass and pim-pam-pum 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.600
 tuna sandwich and good the second thing that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 you are seeing are the days that I have 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.020
 played that are 29 days 3 hours and 56 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 minutes are a long time but only 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.359
 tell you that this is because I only play at 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.390
 this game and I only play in play 3 like this 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.670
 I do not know in 3 years 30 days either 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.789
 neither is it so much of almost 1000 days that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 he's three years old, he's fine, he's fine, but 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.379
 more I do not know good as you see rate of 140 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 that is always pretty good 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 I keep never working so I 'm 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.210
 happy with my rate after so many 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.900
 days played then losses are 112 thousand 946 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.270
 that there are many not two thousand victories 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 989 almost three thousand and tasha wins 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.710
 defeats is 074 because so many times 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.470
 I leave the game 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.420
 because because you have to take out you have to 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.070
 give life and good as you see here the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.920
 score per minute is a bit wrong 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.500
 it's 450 just that I found a hacker and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.720
 I started killing some and that's up 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.659
 a lot of points without the garlic I say and good 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.460
 let's move on to the next thing that 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.720
 next as you are seeing is the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.190
 combat summary that as you can see I have 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.259
 seven thousand 774 shots to the head 238 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.330
 unstoppable and 10k of knives the truth 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.920
 It's pretty everything is pretty cool and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.030
 good as you see also the weapon more 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.429
 used is 94 and the mmc and also 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.950
 we have the mp 7 and the streak of 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.380
 most lethal points the helicopter and that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.539
 it's basically because he only used that the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 game mode as you always see hard by 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.810
 teams because that's where faster I 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.030
 I can take out a gameplay where it's more 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.100
 cortito then we have low domain in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.110
 signed demolition seek to destroy that 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.720
 seek and destroy the fungus more so 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.610
 get to true and good at the end of 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.700
 everything there are two game modes that did not play 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.260
 in my life so I 've seen tv on tv 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 and search and destroy extremes 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.209
 impressive three years and not yet played 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.140
 all modes we are going to go through the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.640
 medallions as you see 238 medals and 17 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.880
 nuclear is quite all done the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.780
 truth out there we have 38 brutal 96 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.660
 relentless we have 223 inexorable ones that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.170
 it's pretty 797 ruthless but what 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.540
 better 4 thousand 634 bloodthirsty and good and 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.269
 as you see here the lava the measure of 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.860
 a works super low had low target 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.019
 bounce this I'm putting it like this a 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.549
 little bit above because I do not have either 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.470
 to talk a lot about it but good 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.510
 if I have put them all and how far 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.700
 also in sliced ​​we have everything 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.820
 first blood of all the kids the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.650
 we all have a lot of medals 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.959
 especially bloodthirsty that are what 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.390
 that I'm cool and good, let's go with the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:17.810
 next and as you see the air weapons 94 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.780
 16,775 casualties plus mete 12 thousand mp 79 thousand 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.870
 that is 7.000 casualties is carache we have 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.049
 around here also the shotgun the pw 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.500
 27 we also have the cut on the cap 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.360
 they are less low 2000 3000 4000 already 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.000
 every time we go down more x minus 1000 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.400
 with the m 8 then we have the hurdler 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.780
 1800 I do not use it much online but 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.700
 well the one for one is the only 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.409
 even then the ballistic knife to 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.180
 gold and good and the last ones no longer 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.790
 abuse because as you see are the tocha to 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.269
 street and little else let's move on with what 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.150
 next here as you can see is the team what 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.040
 most used is the c4 always used and good 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.319
 as you see I leave you there also the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.540
 used and the times that I killed with the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.010
 tomahawk with everything I'm going to put everything 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.870
 little bit so you can see over 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.120
 I do not want to entertain here either 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.989
 are my statistics basically and good 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.299
 already to finish him to finish is 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.720
 my statistics I want to tell you that the 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.879
 Wow 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.409

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.479
 Sometimes it has taken me others do not 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.859
 used that dogs so populous much 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.560
 as now you will see and good only 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.660
 tell you that the best sensitivity that 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.970
 you can use all is new 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.380
 both for the card of 9 so much for 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.180
 sniper like to weapon like to 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.830
 competitive as for everything is the best 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.240
 global sensitivity here I go 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.920
