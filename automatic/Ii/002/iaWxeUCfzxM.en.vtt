00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
Sun example evil shaders or which are in

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.320 
Sun example evil shaders or which are in
the<00:03:44.519> CEOs<00:03:45.000> zip<00:03:45.840> file<00:03:46.170> as<00:03:46.700> well<00:03:47.700> as<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> minecraft

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
the CEOs zip file as well as a minecraft

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.590 
the CEOs zip file as well as a minecraft
jar<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.959> we<00:03:49.049> need<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.290> go<00:03:49.410> back<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.830> bin<00:03:50.600> Mycroft

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
jar so we need to go back to bin Mycroft

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.410 
jar so we need to go back to bin Mycroft
in<00:03:52.200> here<00:03:53.100> you<00:03:53.220> will<00:03:53.340> now<00:03:53.489> find<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:54.090> folder

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
in here you will now find a folder

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.979 
in here you will now find a folder
called<00:03:54.750> shaders<00:03:55.380> which<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.989> we

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
called shaders which is this one and we

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.420 
called shaders which is this one and we
can<00:03:58.140> open<00:03:58.260> up<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.500> shaders<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.070> left<00:03:59.250> side

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
can open up the shaders on the left side

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.970 
can open up the shaders on the left side
as<00:03:59.610> well<00:03:59.790> now<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.780> see<00:04:00.900> basically<00:04:01.500> these<00:04:01.799> are

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
as well now you see basically these are

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.680 
as well now you see basically these are
the<00:04:02.100> same<00:04:02.280> files<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:02.970> they're<00:04:03.209> not<00:04:03.330> with<00:04:03.660> our

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
the same files but they're not with our

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.690 
the same files but they're not with our
they<00:04:04.170> don't<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> same<00:04:04.680> content<00:04:05.370> so

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
they don't have the same content so

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.370 
they don't have the same content so
you're<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.600> drag<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.170> drop<00:04:07.320> the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
you're just going to drag and drop the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.310 
you're just going to drag and drop the
files<00:04:07.590> from<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.700> Sears<00:04:09.120> one<00:04:09.450> foot<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.959> sip

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
files from the Sears one foot to sip

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.340 
files from the Sears one foot to sip
into<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:11.100> minecraft.jar<00:04:11.760> over<00:04:12.330> here<00:04:12.570> BAM

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
into the minecraft.jar over here BAM

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.380 
into the minecraft.jar over here BAM
there<00:04:13.799> we<00:04:13.890> go<00:04:14.100> selection<00:04:14.760> method<00:04:15.150> store<00:04:15.780> again

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
there we go selection method store again

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.909 
there we go selection method store again
close<00:04:18.390> all<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.019> now<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.560> start<00:04:19.799> up

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
close all that and now we can start up

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.770 
close all that and now we can start up
minecraft<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.700> take<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> look<00:04:21.090> at<00:04:21.239> if<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.479> works

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
minecraft and take a look at if it works

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.800 
minecraft and take a look at if it works
or<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.760> she'll<00:04:23.760> actually<00:04:23.910> work<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.479> mean<00:04:24.660> this

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
or not she'll actually work I mean this

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.300 
or not she'll actually work I mean this
is<00:04:24.930> completely<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.500> Minecraft<00:04:25.979> they<00:04:26.160> don't

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
is completely in Minecraft they don't

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.210 
is completely in Minecraft they don't
even<00:04:26.460> have<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.729> wall

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
even have a wall

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.510 
even have a wall
so<00:04:27.840> create<00:04:28.840> Ward's<00:04:29.260> new<00:04:29.440> world<00:04:29.740> there<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.340> go

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so create Ward's new world there we go

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.440 
so create Ward's new world there we go
just<00:04:30.550> created<00:04:31.270> want<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.600> see<00:04:31.720> if<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.900> works<00:04:36.450> and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
just created want to see if it works and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.450 
just created want to see if it works and
there<00:04:37.870> we<00:04:37.960> go<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.740> can<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:39.040> we<00:04:39.280> got

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
there we go as you can see we got

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.640 
there we go as you can see we got
working<00:04:39.670> shaders<00:04:40.420> we<00:04:40.660> got<00:04:40.780> working<00:04:41.140> sun<00:04:41.410> rays

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
working shaders we got working sun rays

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.350 
working shaders we got working sun rays
which<00:04:41.950> are<00:04:42.190> look<00:04:42.460> awesome<00:04:43.000> through<00:04:43.240> the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
which are look awesome through the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.260 
which are look awesome through the
leaves<00:04:43.510> we<00:04:43.900> got<00:04:44.080> our<00:04:44.320> own<00:04:44.890> shadow<00:04:45.460> as<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:46.000> hope

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
leaves we got our own shadow as I hope

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.370 
leaves we got our own shadow as I hope
there<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.200> we<00:04:47.350> got<00:04:47.500> our<00:04:47.530> own<00:04:47.740> shadow<00:04:48.040> and

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
there is that we got our own shadow and

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.900 
there is that we got our own shadow and
now<00:04:50.380> we<00:04:50.440> got<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.680> problem<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.220> we<00:04:51.250> don't

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910
