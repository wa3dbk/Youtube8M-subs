00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the bridge we have a uncoiling which

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.230 
the bridge we have a uncoiling which
allows<00:01:22.259> us<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> school<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> cables<00:01:23.670> off<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
allows us to school the cables off of

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.130 
allows us to school the cables off of
the<00:01:24.360> schools<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:26.310> set<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.850> pusher<00:01:27.299> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
exactly which hole okay in the saddle to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.750 
exactly which hole okay in the saddle to
put<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> ice

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
put it in ice

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.780 
put it in ice
okay<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:06.870> once<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.800> strand<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.550> through

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
okay and then once the strand is through

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.790 
okay and then once the strand is through
the<00:02:08.880> saddle<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.480> takes<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.900> same<00:02:10.050> course<00:02:10.470> on

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
the saddle it takes the same course on

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.220 
the saddle it takes the same course on
the<00:02:11.010> other<00:02:11.160> side<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> pylon<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.330> down<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the other side of the pylon back down to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.620 
the other side of the pylon back down to
the<00:02:13.320> deck<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.580> what's<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.210> next<00:02:15.360> step

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the deck and then what's the next step

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.660 
the deck and then what's the next step
once<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.110> through<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.830> those<00:02:17.160> parts<00:02:17.520> and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
once it's through all of those parts and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
once it's through all of those parts and
pieces<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.300> once<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.750> installed<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
pieces so once it's installed in the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.520 
pieces so once it's installed in the
saddle<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.640> centered<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.720> guys<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
saddle and centered up the guys on the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.120 
saddle and centered up the guys on the
deck<00:02:22.740> will<00:02:24.080> strip<00:02:25.080> some<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.890> black

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
deck will strip some of the black

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.960 
deck will strip some of the black
sheeting<00:02:26.700> off<00:02:26.910> okay<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.190> at<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.430> point<00:02:29.670> they

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
sheeting off okay and at that point they

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.510 
sheeting off okay and at that point they
can<00:02:30.000> install<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.690> into<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.960> anchor<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:32.190> it's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
can install it into the anchor and it's

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.220 
can install it into the anchor and it's
ready<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:33.030> stressing<00:02:33.330> dressing<00:02:34.050> which<00:02:34.200> is

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
ready for stressing dressing which is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.990 
ready for stressing dressing which is
the<00:02:34.440> next<00:02:34.650> step<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> process<00:02:35.250> right<00:02:35.760> we

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the next step in the process right we

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.120 
the next step in the process right we
will<00:02:36.180> learn<00:02:36.390> about<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.780> next<00:02:37.050> time<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.890> tell

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
will learn about that next time so tell

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.950 
will learn about that next time so tell
me<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> little<00:02:38.400> bit<00:02:38.670> about<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.210> strands<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
me a little bit about the strands and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560 
me a little bit about the strands and
the<00:02:40.050> saddles<00:02:40.470> how<00:02:40.680> many<00:02:40.890> saddles<00:02:41.460> per<00:02:41.910> tower

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the saddles how many saddles per tower

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.790 
the saddles how many saddles per tower
pylon<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.650> how<00:02:44.280> many<00:02:44.550> strands<00:02:45.170> from<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
pylon and how many strands from the the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.250 
pylon and how many strands from the the
lowest<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.400> highest<00:02:47.520> saddle<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:49.020> there's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
lowest to the highest saddle so there's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.610 
lowest to the highest saddle so there's
ten<00:02:49.590> different<00:02:49.620> saddles<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.940> pylon<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.230> they

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
ten different saddles the pylon and they

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.330 
ten different saddles the pylon and they
range<00:02:52.950> from<00:02:53.310> 30<00:02:54.180> around<00:02:55.020> thirty<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> hundred

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
range from 30 around thirty to a hundred

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.160 
range from 30 around thirty to a hundred
and<00:02:56.790> ten<00:02:56.940> strands<00:02:57.570> Wow

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and ten strands Wow

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.870 
and ten strands Wow
so<00:02:58.290> you're<00:02:58.410> able<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.860> handle<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> heavier

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
so you're able to handle the heavier

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.390 
so you're able to handle the heavier
load<00:03:00.180> by<00:03:00.780> adding<00:03:01.230> more<00:03:01.380> strands<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:02.370> up

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
load by adding more strands as you go up

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.070 
load by adding more strands as you go up
the<00:03:02.670> tower<00:03:02.820> pylon<00:03:03.300> that's<00:03:03.660> correct

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the tower pylon that's correct

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.750 
the tower pylon that's correct
got<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:04.590> right<00:03:04.740> that's<00:03:04.950> fascinating<00:03:05.610> Mike

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
got it all right that's fascinating Mike

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.300 
got it all right that's fascinating Mike
