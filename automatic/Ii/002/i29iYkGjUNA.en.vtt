weeks<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.820> week<00:01:29.939> something<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
weeks a week something like that the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.380 
weeks a week something like that the
only<00:01:31.890> reason<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.579> play<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
only reason I really play right now is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
only reason I really play right now is
for<00:01:33.659> dungeons<00:01:34.049> cuz<00:01:34.409> they're<00:01:35.070> fun<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.310> find<00:01:35.670> i

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
for dungeons cuz they're fun to find i

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
for dungeons cuz they're fun to find i
usually<00:01:36.270> use<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.540> same<00:01:36.750> glitch<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.520> when

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
usually use the same glitch but when

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.460 
usually use the same glitch but when
it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.790> close<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.329> spawn<00:01:39.659> point<00:01:39.990> i<00:01:40.200> don't

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it's a close to your spawn point i don't

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.830 
it's a close to your spawn point i don't
think<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> matters<00:01:41.990> one<00:01:42.990> note<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.409> um

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
think it matters one note about um

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.569 
think it matters one note about um
dungeons<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.259> oh<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:46.950> gosh<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that's just so close to the surface so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
that's just so close to the surface so
close<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> spawn<00:01:53.490> point<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> make<00:01:54.180> a

close to a spawn point I can make a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
close to a spawn point I can make a
zombie<00:01:54.930> room<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> look<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.740> fail<00:01:55.950> loop

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
zombie room and look at that fail loop

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.930 
zombie room and look at that fail loop
to<00:01:56.369> bucket<00:01:57.329> ironing<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.020> bread<00:01:58.409> Wow
