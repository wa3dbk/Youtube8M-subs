00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 prayer is not a bubble in which we demand of reality in 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.130
 the one we live 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.370
 that does it about fanatical people 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.109
 and we are not experts fanatics 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.349
 us when we pray we pray german decade 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440
 listening is anti-Christian 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.160
 be in front of Jesus with his hands raised and at the same time with his back 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 what martino 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.819
 it is a film that has no presentation within the principles 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.910
 that there is no right 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.880
 there is no right that in a parish parochial group 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.310
 all go to eat pizza or to eat hamburgers when there are people from 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.310
 the same parish that does not have what to do with the market 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.680
 when you are from the community that does not have what to buy milk and bread 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.050
 I do not want the bus back but I think we're going to correct 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.010
 the delegation of the colonel who wrote interested and bruno 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 and it is that we already know how it communicates 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 for more than now 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 with those who share jesus that is needed 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.290
 is the back 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.460
 knowing that he has nothing to live with 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.950
 there is no right 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 and there is no right that people like that still feel Christian 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.180
 nor Pentecost and follow Jesus in the spirit that being a clear choice 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.840
 on the contrary where the other regulations 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.820
 and by taking for the ace on those concrete tracks 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.820
 that responds to the concrete needs 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.180
 while it is not like that 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 we are in an endless spirituality 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.149
 That's why he won the victory in Estoril 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.639
 means in that story because we are already united in a concrete apostolate for 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.639
 rescue the concrete man in concrete reality 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.900
 good to have religious here thank you 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.740
 for those amounts
