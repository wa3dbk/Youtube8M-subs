the pavers from moving side to side

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.670 
the pavers from moving side to side
we're<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> put<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> around<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
we're going to put that around the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.670 
we're going to put that around the
perimeter<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:51.000> goes<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.720> 10<00:01:52.110> inch<00:01:52.290> spikes

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
perimeter it goes in with 10 inch spikes

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010 
perimeter it goes in with 10 inch spikes
gets<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> pavers<00:01:53.610> well<00:01:54.420> what's<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.810> going

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
gets the pavers well what's this going

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.740 
gets the pavers well what's this going
to<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.399> we're<00:01:57.030> gonna<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.329> sand

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
to do is is that we're gonna get sand

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.539 
to do is is that we're gonna get sand
wedged<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.530> between<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> joints

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
wedged in between the joints

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.730 
wedged in between the joints
it's<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.390> wedging<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> sand<00:02:01.259> that's<00:02:01.590> going

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it's that wedging of sand that's going

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's that wedging of sand that's going
to<00:02:01.799> create<00:02:01.920> friction<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.909> prevent<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to create friction and prevent the the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.570 
to create friction and prevent the the
pavers<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:05.460> being<00:02:05.670> loose<00:02:07.160> once<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
pavers from being loose once we get the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.969 
pavers from being loose once we get the
sand<00:02:08.819> into<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> joints<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.530> we're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
sand into the joints then we're going to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.930 
sand into the joints then we're going to
go<00:02:11.280> ahead

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
go ahead

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.180 
go ahead
hose<00:02:12.300> off<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.780> surface<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.380> any<00:02:13.620> loose<00:02:13.860> sand

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
hose off the surface get any loose sand

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.280 
hose off the surface get any loose sand
that's<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:14.820> off<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.050> go<00:02:16.200> ahead

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that's on there off then we can go ahead

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.980 
that's on there off then we can go ahead
