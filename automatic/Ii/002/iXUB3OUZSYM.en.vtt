00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.580 
getting recorded even here in my home
studio<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.510> is<00:00:50.539> not<00:00:50.809> an<00:00:50.930> ideal<00:00:51.559> environment

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
studio this is not an ideal environment

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.520 
studio this is not an ideal environment
I<00:00:52.280> have<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.550> deal<00:00:52.760> with<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.690> fans<00:00:54.050> from<00:00:54.350> my

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
I have to deal with the fans from my

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.330 
I have to deal with the fans from my
computer<00:00:54.949> I<00:00:55.309> have<00:00:56.149> to<00:00:56.300> deal<00:00:56.539> with<00:00:56.809> a<00:00:57.100> I'm<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.309> a

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
computer I have to deal with a I'm in a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.400 
computer I have to deal with a I'm in a
living<00:00:58.670> room<00:00:58.789> type<00:00:59.180> of<00:00:59.329> situation<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.079> can

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
living room type of situation so I can

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.030 
living room type of situation so I can
still<00:01:00.710> hear<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.850> noise<00:01:02.449> coming<00:01:02.989> from<00:01:03.019> say<00:01:03.859> for

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
still hear the noise coming from say for

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.800 
still hear the noise coming from say for
example<00:01:04.100> my<00:01:04.580> refrigerator<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.390> has<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.540> motor

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
example my refrigerator it has a motor

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.840 
example my refrigerator it has a motor
in<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.410> can<00:01:06.980> hear<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.220> refrigerator

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
in it and you can hear the refrigerator

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.090 
in it and you can hear the refrigerator
running<00:01:08.120> so<00:01:08.870> this<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.350> not<00:01:09.619> an<00:01:09.740> ideal

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
running so this is not an ideal

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100 
running so this is not an ideal
environment<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:10.820> okay<00:01:11.150> for<00:01:11.210> me<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.479> do<00:01:11.720> with

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
environment it's okay for me to do with

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.100 
environment it's okay for me to do with
in<00:01:12.229> this<00:01:12.350> podcast<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:13.189> I<00:01:13.400> can<00:01:14.000> do<00:01:14.630> things<00:01:14.869> to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
in this podcast and I can do things to

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.410 
in this podcast and I can do things to
mitigate<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.890> bit<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.970> have<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.270> sit

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
mitigate that a bit but you have to sit

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.820 
mitigate that a bit but you have to sit
down<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.720> listen<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.439> know<00:01:18.590> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
down and listen to it you know and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.219 
down and listen to it you know and
that's<00:01:19.549> one<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.030> big<00:01:20.270> things<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.900> lot

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
that's one of the big things that a lot

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.270 
that's one of the big things that a lot
of<00:01:21.259> people<00:01:21.350> don't<00:01:21.680> do<00:01:21.799> they<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.100> start

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
of people don't do they just start

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.649 
of people don't do they just start
recording<00:01:22.549> without<00:01:22.790> listening<00:01:23.180> for<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
recording without listening for the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.230 
recording without listening for the
noise<00:01:23.829> listen<00:01:24.829> for<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.070> traffic<00:01:25.400> going<00:01:25.909> by<00:01:26.030> in

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
noise listen for the traffic going by in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.240

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
you've got traffic well then you've got

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.710

a<00:01:30.979> position<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.579> microphone<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.479> it

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
a position to microphone so that it

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.420 
a position to microphone so that it
doesn't<00:01:32.900> pick<00:01:33.110> up<00:01:33.259> all<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.590> traffic<00:01:33.920> or<00:01:34.250> do

recognizing that the traffic can be an
issue<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.710> know<00:01:39.979> airplanes<00:01:40.310> going<00:01:40.970> overhead

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
issue you know airplanes going overhead

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.319 
issue you know airplanes going overhead
you<00:01:42.470> know<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.799> sometimes<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.670> some<00:01:43.850> houses

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
you know and sometimes in some houses

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.760 
you know and sometimes in some houses
you<00:01:44.450> know<00:01:44.479> even<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.320> sound<00:01:45.590> can<00:01:45.740> travel

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
you know even the sound can travel

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.770 
you know even the sound can travel
through<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.340> floor<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:46.939> people<00:01:47.299> walking

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
through the floor so people walking

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.810 
through the floor so people walking
around<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.350> everything<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.250> soccer<00:01:49.579> travel

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
around and everything the soccer travel

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.490 
around and everything the soccer travel
actually<00:01:50.270> through<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.570> floorboards<00:01:51.380> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
actually through the floorboards and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.440 
actually through the floorboards and
back<00:01:51.920> up<00:01:52.159> through<00:01:52.460> your<00:01:52.520> microphone<00:01:53.060> stand

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
back up through your microphone stand

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.999 
back up through your microphone stand
into<00:01:53.869> your<00:01:54.020> microphone<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.740> might<00:01:54.890> not

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
into your microphone and you might not

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.889 
into your microphone and you might not
even<00:01:55.070> know<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.369> that's<00:01:56.090> where<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.450> filters

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
even know it that's where the filters

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.440 
even know it that's where the filters
helped<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.040> lot<00:01:58.189> because<00:01:58.399> they<00:01:58.790> filter<00:01:59.270> out<00:01:59.329> a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
helped a lot because they filter out a

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
whole lot of that lowend Rumble that you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.980 
whole lot of that lowend Rumble that you
normally<00:02:01.280> don't<00:02:01.520> pay<00:02:01.789> attention<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.719> lot<00:02:02.810> of

that stuff will be out of there ok and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.310

to be too technical about it but the

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.220 
to be too technical about it but the
polar<00:02:28.280> pattern<00:02:28.879> represents<00:02:29.150> how<00:02:29.959> this

polar pattern represents how this
