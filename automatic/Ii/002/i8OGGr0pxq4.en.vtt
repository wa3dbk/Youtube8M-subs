 waffle therefore get to know only today 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.029
 and a correct person is real 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.800
 unright a correct person beautiful 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.900
 Greetings to you thanks that beautiful 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.730
 this job has helped here 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.380
 of course that can happen too 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.419
 alone do not create a topic but me 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.830
 not just stand next door today 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.650
 so let april say come along 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.630
 pure and try your luck and show 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.079
 hey, hey, he's really one 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.559
 correct actually to the thing to the 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.480
 cases 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.600
 I've been thinking about doing tutorial too 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.969
 attack everything about the ps4 what 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.219
 goes and what does not work and what's cool 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.379
 turn around not as an educator 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.940
 to gradually be doing my channel 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.469
 if you already see in the underground okay 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.019
 it's thorn and peter with the redstone 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.609
 flaring that is, the chop piston 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.460
 Remember to move on this switch 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.649
 that's hopefully going to go 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.690
 clear with everyone if I have then 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.060
 Just ask and ask the questions 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.100
 below in the comments i answer 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.810
 She likes and shows you here again 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.570
 By the way, you can of course 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.220
 let's get called again 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.780
 why do you build that and not just 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.720
 I will show and of course I will 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.980
 the one to one present my videos 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.200
 that is, I have now for the first time here 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.030
 to build everything to show you that it is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.440
 also looks really cool and not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.920
 was just slapped down so only 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.770
 the city thinks a great hall and 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.300
 Trallala Tralala said to come now 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.430
 we have to point we have to get here first 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.010
 to do everything or everything first 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.200
 a big hole could make this 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.520
 yes, even with lava and water lead this 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.380
 but will at the conclusion of the videos 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.910
 Number here again if you are here 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.920
 then you go down over 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.410
 shit but now comes the next 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 problem people if now the ceiling higher 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.500
 you can not skip anymore 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.480
 of course you can join 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.420
 ZweibrÃ¼cken higher because the minecraft in the 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.060
 cut two blocks is big with the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.660
 head stop that fits through and to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.760
 jump 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.830
 So now he is so pretend 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.830
 if you do that again now 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.720
 ceiling as about 45 you have the chance 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.010
 to leap over 100 that he'll give you 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.750
 immediately notice 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.519
 I have another solution for that 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.769
 You can extend that 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.989
 whole stick that the pistons fall 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.750
 secured for a longer time is secured 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.970
 so be careful if the height 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.459
 right and again the length is easy 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.290
 times we test us down then 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.629
 let's do the whole earth away so mine 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.760
 colleague helps me build now and now 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.150
 Let's stick the sticks here 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.250
 tuned 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.930
 incidentally, the problem is still known 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.760
 to say with the sticking piston 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 that one when set as the wrong one 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.030
 a small tip would set 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.349
 a little further away I still see 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.280
 that people are still trying in the 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.409
 near to do this 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.760
 So is most like gnocchi for 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.769
 example, I am very close and the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.190
 a mess really different 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.720
 again 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.459
 Now you have to know that you're going back there 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.909
 even more and now works is 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.560
 Hammer hammer is cool so that she 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.090
 he will stop the longer trap that is 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.859
 we'll do that to him first 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 colleague does this to redstone and 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.299
 peter turn redstone ran and the west 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.709
 Signal goes so far as well as you can 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.319
 could also weight five to six 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.549
 seven to seven men at the most 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.900
 still extend 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.370
 but we need that in this one now 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.340
 Do not fall and now if we are here now 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.269
 go over and jump you fall in 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.889
 the trap is tapped 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.720
 So we try that again 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.560
 a speed cabinet though 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.000
 but never failed to do so 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.790
 Let's do it down here best 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.980
 a water bucket downstairs but once 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.879
 mixed because again with the water 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.980
 hang people and forest lawa trendy so we 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.900
 make short a barrier here 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.139
 on the left lover and up 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.790
 the right side of what you can do it 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.980
 Of course, you look like yourself 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.239
 want to make a trap now I have one 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.139
 made mistakes now I have something alone 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.069
 done now came 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.319
 obsidian or not 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.389
 Of course you can choose it yourself 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.069
 how you wanted to create that means 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.449
 I want to design this myself 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.069
 Just wanted to tell you it is 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.840
 quite simply fall to build completely 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.099
 quick and easy I'm through with that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.659
 away i hope you have your own 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.909
 mesh-like minister completely overload 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.599
