all<00:00:02.850> right<00:00:03.500> part<00:00:04.500> two<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:04.980> little<00:00:05.310> video

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
all right part two of this little video

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.360 
all right part two of this little video
about<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.359> neural<00:00:06.600> tube<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.710> left<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> last

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
about the neural tube so I left the last

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.230 
about the neural tube so I left the last
picture<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.059> what<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:10.260> neural<00:00:10.559> tube

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
picture of what the neural tube

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.670 
picture of what the neural tube
transforms<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.420> around<00:00:12.840> day<00:00:13.639> 30<00:00:14.750> 27<00:00:15.750> roughly

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
transforms in around day 30 27 roughly

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.380 
transforms in around day 30 27 roughly
around<00:00:16.800> there<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.150> picture

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
around there but it's not a good picture

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.160 
around there but it's not a good picture
so<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> did<00:00:19.619> was<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:21.000> drew<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so what I did was is I drew what the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.670 
so what I did was is I drew what the
inside<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.460> looks<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.300> okay<00:00:24.720> found

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
inside of this looks like okay found

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.150 
inside of this looks like okay found
this<00:00:25.920> offline<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:27.689> stay<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.349> me<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.769> label

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
this offline so stay with me as I label

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.620 
this offline so stay with me as I label
it<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.210> put<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> in

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it for you I'm going to put it in

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.319 
it for you I'm going to put it in
different<00:00:30.779> colors<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:33.120> get

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
different colors so you can get

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.209 
different colors so you can get
understanding<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.290> what's<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
understanding of what's going on so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.160 
understanding of what's going on so
pretty<00:00:35.460> much<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> neuro<00:00:36.300> folds<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
pretty much when the neuro folds and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.220 
pretty much when the neuro folds and
everything<00:00:37.920> come<00:00:38.160> over<00:00:38.399> top<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.540> neural<00:00:39.899> tube

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
everything come over top the neural tube

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.979 
everything come over top the neural tube
and<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> neural<00:00:40.950> crest<00:00:41.280> will<00:00:41.790> separate<00:00:42.629> from

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and the neural crest will separate from

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.400 
and the neural crest will separate from
the<00:00:43.829> ectoderm<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.450> start<00:00:45.930> forming

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the ectoderm and they will start forming

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.979 
the ectoderm and they will start forming
inside<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:48.840> pouch<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:50.989> skeletal

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
inside of this little pouch or skeletal

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.520 
inside of this little pouch or skeletal
protection<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.460> happened<00:00:53.730> okay

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
protection what happened okay

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.950 
protection what happened okay

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
so first I'm just going to go into

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.200 
so first I'm just going to go into
coloring<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.219> I'm<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> keep<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
coloring and I'm going to keep this the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.899 
coloring and I'm going to keep this the
same<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.809> everybody<00:01:05.510> found<00:01:06.510> my<00:01:06.689> green<00:01:06.960> marker

right and nota chord this right here has
to<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.710> present<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.490> order<00:01:59.970> for<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.450> neural

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
to be present in order for the neural

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.710 
to be present in order for the neural
tube<00:02:01.140> formation<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> occur<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.630> of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
tube formation to occur you can kind of

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.059 
tube formation to occur you can kind of
look<00:02:03.929> at<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.960> start<00:02:07.380> button<00:02:07.679> if

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
look at this as the start button if

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
look at this as the start button if
you'll<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> start<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.239> can't<00:02:09.509> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you'll have the start but you can't you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:22.009 
you'll have the start but you can't you
can't<00:02:09.959> start<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:18.650> here<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.989> just

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
can't start so here is just this is just

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:32.510 
can't start so here is just this is just
the<00:02:22.290> ectoderm<00:02:22.709> okay

this blue okay and then here is our
three<00:02:47.520> parts<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.000> our<00:02:48.180> sub<00:02:48.450> line<00:02:48.720> okay<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.670> here

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
three parts of our sub line okay so here

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:03.290 
three parts of our sub line okay so here
is<00:02:50.880> our<00:02:51.030> anterior<00:02:51.890> all<00:02:52.890> right<00:02:54.560> anterior

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
I'm gonna go with the pink again alright

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.300 
I'm gonna go with the pink again alright
and<00:04:07.700> this<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.120> going<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.330> be<00:04:08.510> our<00:04:08.750> lateral<00:04:11.200> and

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
and this is going to be our lateral and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:23.850 
and this is going to be our lateral and
the<00:04:13.310> lateral<00:04:15.070> be<00:04:18.040> our<00:04:19.040> dermatome

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.760 

so<00:04:24.490> this<00:04:25.240> big<00:04:25.479> black<00:04:25.659> arrows<00:04:26.080> are<00:04:26.199> showing<00:04:26.379> you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
so this big black arrows are showing you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.330 
so this big black arrows are showing you
what<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.220> looks<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.379> and<00:04:29.650> these

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
what this looks like in this and these

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.640 
what this looks like in this and these
some<00:04:30.639> mites<00:04:30.849> as<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.120> can<00:04:31.270> see<00:04:31.509> will<00:04:32.080> be<00:04:32.110> all<00:04:32.439> up

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
some mites as you can see will be all up

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.830 
some mites as you can see will be all up
and<00:04:32.830> down<00:04:33.069> and<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:33.969> is<00:04:34.120> how<00:04:34.270> they<00:04:34.479> are<00:04:34.569> laid

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
and down and this is how they are laid

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.709 
and down and this is how they are laid
out<00:04:35.370> these<00:04:36.370> on<00:04:36.669> these<00:04:36.969> other<00:04:37.180> two<00:04:37.449> things

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:37.719 
out these on these other two things

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.129 
out these on these other two things
right<00:04:37.930> here<00:04:38.229> this<00:04:38.979> is<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:40.330> little<00:04:40.599> bottom<00:04:40.930> I'm

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
right here this is a little bottom I'm

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.499 
right here this is a little bottom I'm
not<00:04:41.379> even<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.740> color<00:04:42.039> it

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
not even going to color it

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.249 
not even going to color it
but<00:04:43.509> I'll<00:04:43.599> label<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:44.139> for<00:04:44.169> everybody<00:04:49.259> this

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
but I'll label it for everybody this

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.120 
but I'll label it for everybody this
will<00:04:50.469> be<00:04:50.620> our

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.980 

endoderm

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
endoderm

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:08.470 
endoderm
and<00:04:56.080> this<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:58.360> thing<00:04:58.660> right<00:04:58.930> here<00:04:59.759> color

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.710 

oh<00:05:08.540> yeah

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.010 

this<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.470> going<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.680> be<00:05:13.830> our<00:05:13.980> mesoderm<00:05:14.430> okay<00:05:15.020> so

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
this is going to be our mesoderm okay so

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.340 
this is going to be our mesoderm okay so
this<00:05:16.290> these<00:05:16.770> are<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.160> be<00:05:20.690> two<00:05:21.690> sections

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
this these are going to be two sections

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.540 
this these are going to be two sections
of<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:24.690> this<00:05:24.870> side<00:05:25.170> is<00:05:25.200> one<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:26.100> side<00:05:26.370> is

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
of it so this side is one this side is

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.420 
of it so this side is one this side is
another<00:05:26.850> we<00:05:27.630> make<00:05:27.840> sure<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.080> got<00:05:28.380> it<00:05:28.440> right<00:05:28.710> this

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
another we make sure I got it right this

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.130 
another we make sure I got it right this
side<00:05:29.730> right<00:05:29.970> here<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:31.220> our<00:05:32.220> parietal<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.330> this

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
side right here is our parietal and this

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.720 
side right here is our parietal and this
one<00:05:34.290> right<00:05:34.410> here<00:05:36.500> is<00:05:37.500> our<00:05:37.740> visceral<00:05:38.100> if<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.550> got

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
one right here is our visceral if I got

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.800 
one right here is our visceral if I got
that<00:05:38.970> right<00:05:39.150> yeah

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
that right yeah

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.220 
that right yeah
this<00:05:40.530> rule<00:05:40.890> lateral<00:05:41.640> play<00:05:44.660> parietal<00:05:45.660> lateral

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
this rule lateral play parietal lateral

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.610 
this rule lateral play parietal lateral
play<00:05:47.450> don't<00:05:48.450> pay<00:05:48.630> any<00:05:48.810> attention<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.320> this

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
play don't pay any attention to this

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.400 
play don't pay any attention to this
this<00:05:49.950> was<00:05:50.160> just<00:05:50.190> in<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.820> drawing<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:52.230> just

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
this was just in the drawing and I just

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.920 
this was just in the drawing and I just
wanted<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:53.130> see<00:05:53.550> what<00:05:53.760> they<00:05:53.910> were<00:05:53.970> so

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
wanted you to see what they were so

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.270 
wanted you to see what they were so
pretty<00:05:55.110> much<00:05:55.350> this<00:05:55.500> is<00:05:55.560> what<00:05:55.710> you're<00:05:55.980> looking

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
pretty much this is what you're looking

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.610 
pretty much this is what you're looking
at<00:05:56.460> that<00:05:57.030> whole<00:05:57.240> process<00:05:57.630> of<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.320> neural

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
at that whole process of the neural

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.190 
at that whole process of the neural
folds<00:05:59.070> coming<00:05:59.460> in<00:05:59.670> is<00:05:59.930> pretty<00:06:00.930> much<00:06:02.990> trying<00:06:03.990> to

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
folds coming in is pretty much trying to

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.710 
folds coming in is pretty much trying to
separate<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.040> neural<00:06:05.340> tube<00:06:05.580> and<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.450> neural

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
separate the neural tube and the neural

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.610 
separate the neural tube and the neural
crest<00:06:06.930> from<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.680> actual<00:06:08.040> ectoderm<00:06:08.760> because

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
crest from the actual ectoderm because

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.409 
crest from the actual ectoderm because
at<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.980> beginning<00:06:11.310> they're<00:06:11.580> all<00:06:11.820> on<00:06:12.150> one

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
at the beginning they're all on one

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.790 
at the beginning they're all on one
thing<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.900> as<00:06:13.169> the<00:06:13.440> folds<00:06:14.390> come<00:06:15.390> together<00:06:16.050> it

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
thing and as the folds come together it

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.100 
thing and as the folds come together it
pushes<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.700> neural<00:06:18.060> tube<00:06:18.330> in<00:06:18.570> the<00:06:18.810> neural

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
pushes the neural tube in the neural

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.780 
pushes the neural tube in the neural
crest<00:06:19.320> out<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.690> into<00:06:21.690> its<00:06:21.930> own<00:06:22.560> forms<00:06:23.160> inside

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
crest out and into its own forms inside

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.120 
crest out and into its own forms inside
the<00:06:24.090> embryo<00:06:24.720> right<00:06:25.340> so<00:06:26.340> thank<00:06:26.970> you
