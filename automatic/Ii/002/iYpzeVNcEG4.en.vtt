probably<00:04:01.459> aren't<00:04:01.760> an<00:04:02.000> issue<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.990> tens<00:04:03.230> in

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
probably aren't an issue but the tens in

probably aren't an issue but the tens in
twenty<00:04:03.770> ten<00:04:03.920> thousands<00:04:04.430> marks<00:04:04.760> would<00:04:04.910> be<00:04:05.590> so

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
twenty ten thousands marks would be so

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.870 
twenty ten thousands marks would be so
what<00:04:06.740> I'm<00:04:06.800> going<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.010> put<00:04:07.220> myself<00:04:07.370> through<00:04:07.670> all

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
what I'm going to put myself through all

what I'm going to put myself through all
this<00:04:08.150> I<00:04:08.420> mean<00:04:09.140> everybody<00:04:09.950> knows<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.310> have<00:04:10.459> a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
this I mean everybody knows I have a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.520 
this I mean everybody knows I have a
dial<00:04:10.730> bore<00:04:10.940> gauge<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.510> I've<00:04:12.080> converted<00:04:12.470> this

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
dial bore gauge and I've converted this

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.470 
dial bore gauge and I've converted this
over<00:04:12.830> with<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.130> digital<00:04:13.700> indicator<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:14.360> the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
over with the digital indicator on the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.449 
over with the digital indicator on the
top<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.739> more<00:04:15.890> quickly<00:04:16.160> go

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
top so that we can more quickly go

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.830 
top so that we can more quickly go
through<00:04:16.489> these<00:04:16.820> things<00:04:17.090> without<00:04:17.419> having<00:04:17.630> to

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
through these things without having to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.420 
through these things without having to
do<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.020> whole<00:04:18.109> bunch<00:04:18.230> of<00:04:18.530> conversions<00:04:19.040> off<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.370> a

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430

I<00:04:19.910> have<00:04:20.060> probably<00:04:20.270> only<00:04:20.600> need<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.900> be<00:04:20.959> accurate

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
I have probably only need to be accurate

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.350 
I have probably only need to be accurate
to<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.650> thousandth<00:04:22.100> of<00:04:22.220> an<00:04:22.340> inch<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.730> this<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
to a thousandth of an inch and this is

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.540 
to a thousandth of an inch and this is
accurate<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.870> half<00:04:24.080> thousand<00:04:24.590> I'm<00:04:25.250> just<00:04:25.430> going

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
accurate to half thousand I'm just going

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.280 
accurate to half thousand I'm just going
to<00:04:25.610> insert<00:04:25.880> this<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.300> here<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.750> as<00:04:26.930> we<00:04:27.080> pull

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
to insert this in here and as we pull

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.620 
to insert this in here and as we pull
back<00:04:27.320> towards<00:04:28.310> us<00:04:28.610> you'll<00:04:29.210> see<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.450> this

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
back towards us you'll see that this

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.570 
back towards us you'll see that this
number<00:04:29.810> increases

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
number increases

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.090 
number increases
and<00:04:31.850> then<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.540> gives<00:04:32.810> us<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.050> value<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.920> highest

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
and then it gives us a value the highest

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.700 
and then it gives us a value the highest
value<00:04:34.640> with<00:04:34.790> reads<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.020> value<00:04:36.350> we<00:04:36.470> want<00:04:36.500> to

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
value with reads is the value we want to

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.270 
value with reads is the value we want to
go<00:04:36.830> with<00:04:37.630> my<00:04:38.630> fault<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.740> I'm<00:04:39.830> gonna<00:04:39.890> pull<00:04:40.160> this

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
go with my fault so I'm gonna pull this

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.620 
go with my fault so I'm gonna pull this
forward<00:04:42.970> looks<00:04:43.970> like<00:04:44.120> we<00:04:44.240> got<00:04:44.360> six

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
forward looks like we got six

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.870 
forward looks like we got six
thousandths<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.140> an<00:04:45.260> inch<00:04:45.380> so<00:04:45.980> that's<00:04:46.160> three

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
thousandths of an inch so that's three

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.720 
thousandths of an inch so that's three
point<00:04:47.270> three<00:04:47.360> four<00:04:47.870> four<00:04:48.310> we<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:49.490> this

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
point three four four we have this

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.450 
point three four four we have this
zeroed<00:04:50.270> at<00:04:50.710> three<00:04:51.710> point<00:04:51.980> three<00:04:52.040> five<00:04:52.400> oh

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
zeroed at three point three five oh

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.790 
zeroed at three point three five oh
right<00:04:52.880> now<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.720> if<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.900> subtract<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.530> reading

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
right now so if we subtract the reading

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.350 
right now so if we subtract the reading
we<00:04:54.920> got<00:04:55.100> off<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:55.490> which<00:04:55.730> was<00:04:55.940> six

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
we got off of this which was six

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.180 
we got off of this which was six
thousandths<00:04:56.840> of<00:04:56.900> an<00:04:57.020> inch<00:04:57.140> from<00:04:57.680> three<00:04:57.980> point

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
four four and all I have to do is just

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.180 
four four and all I have to do is just
walk<00:05:02.270> down<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.810> bourse<00:05:03.020> with<00:05:03.290> this<00:05:03.530> and

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
walk down the bourse with this and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:43.250 
walk down the bourse with this and

in many places these measurements were

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.360 
in many places these measurements were

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
dead on that's dead on that one so many

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:05.560 
dead on that's dead on that one so many
of<00:05:57.840> them<00:05:58.020> are<00:05:58.170> only<00:05:58.200> a<00:05:58.770> half<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.610> thousandth<00:06:00.060> off

and many of them are only a thousandth
off<00:06:08.190> so<00:06:08.850> this<00:06:09.000> proves<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.510> telescoping

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.750 
need to have a bore gauge it's so much

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 
number one is also perfectly straight so

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.050 
number one is also perfectly straight so
I<00:07:13.170> have<00:07:13.440> significant<00:07:14.070> taper<00:07:14.280> and<00:07:14.550> only<00:07:14.820> one
