00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.920
 well here we are in a tutorial for 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.180
 how to crack or patch of the curs voice 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 first we have to go to the page 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 official 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.460
 we make an account then go and download 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.269
 the course for windows 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.500
 past I have lowered and then enters 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.360
 the link I think travels in the description 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.360
 low in this file 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.560
 to the folder where they have installed 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 voice course 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.620
 the paste in the banavih file paste the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.230
 file then decompress it or what 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.360
 they extract from anxiety everything 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.430
 the initial opens the course and opens the god 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.160
 laws also and there it would be ready 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.010
 to use they put their data they give in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 create a room or join one have to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.000
 pass the link either creating a room or 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.660
 by joining their validated peers who 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660
 want to talk 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.410
 or here it would be a bit like it is inside the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.500
 game 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.560
 the program that I have is not timing 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.590
 baron dragon every time it is visible 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.350
 and if the enemy team did it or you 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.850
 team is going to restart up to the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.420
 left we have the blue have the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.940
 colleagues with whom we are in course 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.250

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.730
 timing also here we see the timing in 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.220
 red that starts to go down 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.500
 also down here we have to flip 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.040
 our microphone or flip the microphone 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.020
 from the friend of the ally with whom we are 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.400
 speaking right now and this would be all 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.400
 inside the game 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.530
