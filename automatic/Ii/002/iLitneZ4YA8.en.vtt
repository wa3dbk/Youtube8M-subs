00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.189
 e 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.860
 they have changed a lot in the 15 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.350
 last years there is a surgery 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.300
 open traditional who knows who 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:22.780
 that's who happened to his development 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.390
 and then came techniques of 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.000
 surgery called little avaaz yves by 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.039
 laparoscopy of which I am one of 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.289
 pioneers and then then that's add 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.420
 robotic assistance techniques 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.800
 there is no work that they could 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.180
 show for example that a technique 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 were better statistics miss 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:45.250
 another most important one always 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 it's about who does what 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.610
 the experience of the surgeons or the dog 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.860
 who supports a patient and a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.280
 considerable impact on the quality of 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.579
 results 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.160
 whether it's the result on cology that a 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.530
 only cancer is functional we have 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.979
 clearly made the choice of surgery 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.030
 minimally invasive 1 currently 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.430
 for the surgery of the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.509
 prostate 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.179
 all patients are operated on 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.789
 minimally invasive surgery most are 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.409
 made in coelioscopy assisted robot and 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.350
 some patients are still done in 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.250
 traditional laparoscopy one is very 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.900
 pleased with this technique 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.450
 the immediate follow-up for the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.940
 patient are very comfortable and before 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.120
 the whole patient at the salon tests all 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 the machines so the passion console the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.140
 surgeon console is where we are 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.150
 celio during all of 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.940
 the intervention we ensure the safety 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.540
 patients by monitoring 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.680
 continuous they are vital it allows 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.870
 also 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.080
 did the ps itself follow 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.320
 general with an excellent relationship 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.960
 muscle allowing the surgeons I 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.420
 will see in good conditions and in 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.890
 a maximum citizen in last 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.480
 part the intervention 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.830
 we start that drugs 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.770
 to take care of the pain 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.800
 postoperative so there 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.569
 continues the direction the bladder and the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.400
 prostate 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.260
 the essential advantage 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.290
 France stays at the vision in three 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290
 dimensions 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.970
 the impression of finding sensations 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.340
 additional surgery open 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.959
 dial 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.940
 the ergonomics of the times what makes one has 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.410
 more movement than meet this 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.430
 that could be done in laparoscopy or 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.260
 classical 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.930
 we will try to do as far as 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.370
 possible activation table is 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.549
 possible it is achievable 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.219
 and if it's not possible we'll take it in 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.379
 recovery room so that it eliminates these 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.349
 anesthetized products funny anesthetized 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.430
 and it will be studied in the recovery room 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.680
 after the recovery room 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.920
 so the patient and brought back into his 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.840
 room in the urology ward 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.290
 or else we feel continuous if needed 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.750
 monitoring a little closer 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.750
 we monitor the constants the pain
