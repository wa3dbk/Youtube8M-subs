00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.569
 the staff as I had reported in the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.900
 Previous video I would buy one 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.120
 playstation 4 connect here and adding 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.389
 some things like hobby academy in 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 my na on my installation 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.520
 so playstation 4 arrived today I 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.439
 I'm installing the initial update 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.849
 He's asking for here. It's going to take a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 bit to do this update 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.750
 then like that the xbox a little to the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.870
 side I put the playstation 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.450
 on his side as you can see here 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.780
 playstation is significantly smaller 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:52.890
 that xbox good what has changed here continue 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 using splitter and only now in a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.800
 scaffold where the xbox is connected to the port 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.989
 a playstation on the 2-port port does not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.189
 I'm using it and the output it has on 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 twitter 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.700
 the sound is working out of my 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 home theater is not coming out of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.240
 television 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 This is the little song that plays on the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.880
 playstation menu to show how 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 it works 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.530
 now I'll call that xbox only for 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:37.070
 Comparation 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:37.070
 The cool xbox and I will toggle 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:48.670
 on the door a correct then very practical 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.490
 to this type of installation here the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.560
 splitter is already playing the sound of the two 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.479
 home theater, whatever 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.970
 the equipment they had in the gym that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.130
 the promised sound comes out then in case 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.960
 connected to the xbox will only on it is connected 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:10.860
 playstation playstation sound 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.860
 I want to put playstation now xbox 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.040
 now takes the xbox that is on the black screen 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
 even if you are starting the xbox it takes 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.550
 a little bit the initialization of the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.550
 playstation is faster than xbox 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.550
 now he is simply calling 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:39.209
 let's switch between each other 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.209
 relatively rapid alternation 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:53.970
 put on let's pass pro play is a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.970
 I even brought you a new signal, right? 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.310
 is already downloading another update from 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.700
 raid xbox is champion 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.470
 the update yesterday I got the forum to 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.060
 5 had not yet been playing for 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.939
 first time forum 5 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.750
 he asked for a small update of 8gb 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.810
 and mail 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.019
 Imagine imagining someone doing these 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.090
 updates there with the internet slow 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.200
 I 'm just calling here just to see what 's going on. 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:38.090
 going out 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:40.250
 the volume is the very good man does not have 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.989
 delay the image quality is 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 perfect does not lose any quality 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.290
 even though the installation 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:58.269
 here xbox hang up 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:58.269
 yes, yes, disconnect the gbox 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:07.760
 so do not lose quality do this and 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.739
 is very practical mainly for 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.120
 who has both games we will teach you 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.519
 xbox and hung up 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.519
 let's get back to the play station 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.810
 now I will have to do the installation 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.520
 I'll have to install the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.409
 update here I have to zone 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.729
 Look, I'm going to play and I'll record one. 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:33.969
 to feel the claudication of him until 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.969
 we
