00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 and the seven angels who had seven 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.020
 trumpets prepared to touch them the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.840
 first angel played the trumpet and there was 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.059
 hail and fire mixed with blood that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.550
 they were thrown on the earth and the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.000
 third of the trees burned and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.550
 it burned all the green grass the second 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.470
 angel played the trumpet and like a great 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.989
 mountain burning the fire was 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.840
 precipitated in the sea and the third part 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.580
 of the sea became blood and died 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 the third part of living beings 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.370
 that were in the sea and the third part 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.920
 of the ships was destroyed the third 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 angel played the trumpet and fell from heaven 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 a big star burning like a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.970
 torch and fell on the third part 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.490
 of the rivers and the sources of the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 waters and the name of the star is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 absinthe and a third of the waters 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.649
 he became wormwood and many men 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.630
 died because of those waters because they 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.420
 they made bitter 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.579
 the fourth an gesture with the complete one and it was 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.860
 wound the third part of the sun and the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.960
 third part of the moon and the third 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.720
 part of the stars so that it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.970
 obscures one third of them and does not 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.179
 there was light in the third part of the day 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.880
 and likewise of the night the fifth angel 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.979
 he played the trumpet and a star that fell 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.679
 of heaven on earth and he was given the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.319
 key to the pit of the abyss and opened the 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.450
 pit in the abyss and smoke rose from the well 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.670
 like smoke from a large furnace and it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.520
 darkened the sun and the air by smoke 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 from the well and from the smoke came locusts 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.569
 on earth and they were given power as 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.899
 they have power the scorpions of the 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.640
 earth the sixth angel sounded the trumpet and 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.649
 I heard a voice from among the four horns 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.780
 of the golden altar that was in front of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.840
 god saying to the sixth angel he had 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.579
 the trumpet unleashes the four angels 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.790
 which are tied together by the great river 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.560
 euphrates and the four were unleashed 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.830
 angels who were prepared to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.560
 to get better 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.140
 me that year in order to kill the third 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.050
 part of the men and the number of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.050
 armies of 70 200 million
