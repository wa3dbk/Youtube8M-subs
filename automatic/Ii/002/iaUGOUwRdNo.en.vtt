00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.330 
does is it basically lowers your
opponent's<00:01:59.330> speed<00:01:59.780> stat<00:02:00.170> by<00:02:00.380> one<00:02:00.590> stage<00:02:00.920> and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
opponent's speed stat by one stage and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.300 
opponent's speed stat by one stage and
this<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.240> I'm<00:02:02.330> talking<00:02:02.750> about<00:02:02.810> by

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
this is what I'm talking about by

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.560 
this is what I'm talking about by
opponents<00:02:04.310> thinking<00:02:04.760> twice<00:02:04.970> as<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.390> whether

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
opponents thinking twice as to whether

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.740 
opponents thinking twice as to whether
or<00:02:05.720> not<00:02:05.780> they<00:02:06.020> should<00:02:06.050> switch<00:02:06.350> out<00:02:06.680> or<00:02:06.830> not<00:02:07.010> um

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
or not they should switch out or not um

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.370 
or not they should switch out or not um
because<00:02:08.830> after<00:02:09.830> minus<00:02:10.670> one<00:02:10.940> speed<00:02:11.750> you're

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
because after minus one speed you're

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.960 
because after minus one speed you're
probably<00:02:12.740> going<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> get<00:02:13.490> out

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
probably going to get out

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.680 
probably going to get out
sped<00:02:14.240> by<00:02:14.480> seismitoad<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:16.180> seismitoad<00:02:17.180> can

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
sped by seismitoad and seismitoad can

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.930 
sped by seismitoad and seismitoad can
just<00:02:17.960> wall<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.250> day<00:02:19.520> every<00:02:19.910> day

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
just wall you all day every day

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.990 
just wall you all day every day
especially<00:02:20.270> if<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.930> gets<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.200> burn<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:22.490> next

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
especially if it gets a burn the next

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.220 
especially if it gets a burn the next
move<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.390> we're<00:02:23.480> going<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:23.750> using<00:02:23.780> is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
move that we're going to be using is

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.180 
move that we're going to be using is
rest<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:25.070> restore<00:02:25.730> its<00:02:25.970> HP<00:02:26.180> fully<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.230> cure

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
rest to restore its HP fully and cure

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.700 
rest to restore its HP fully and cure
any<00:02:28.460> statuses<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.660> might<00:02:29.840> have<00:02:29.990> been

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
any statuses that it might have been

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.410 
induced with and the last move we're
going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.740> using<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.070> sleep<00:02:34.430> talk<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.060> come

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
going to be using a sleep talk and come

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.560 
going to be using a sleep talk and come
on<00:02:35.980> everybody<00:02:36.980> knows<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.850> combination<00:02:38.090> of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
on everybody knows the combination of

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.100 
on everybody knows the combination of
rest<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.140> sleep<00:02:39.320> talk<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.970> sleep<00:02:41.330> talk<00:02:41.600> when

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
rest and sleep talk you sleep talk when

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.080 
rest and sleep talk you sleep talk when
you're<00:02:42.200> sleeping<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.160> randomly<00:02:43.760> choose<00:02:43.850> a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
you're sleeping to randomly choose a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.590 
you're sleeping to randomly choose a
move<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.160> there<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.280> have<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.520> sleep<00:02:47.360> talk

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
move and there you have it sleep talk

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.110 
move and there you have it sleep talk
and<00:02:47.810> rest<00:02:48.050> one<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> best<00:02:49.400> combinations

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
and rest one of the best combinations

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.570 
and rest one of the best combinations
ever<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.780> that's<00:02:51.590> basically<00:02:52.010> all<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.280> had<00:02:52.550> to
