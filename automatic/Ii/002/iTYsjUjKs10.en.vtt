00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.189
 yes hello you love today, it gives me 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 again a video from outside 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.599
 Today we are at my favorite stream 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 landed 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.510
 then i always go on friday afternoon 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.000
 like to walk as here with ours 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.060
 dogs and i have noticed though 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.029
 I then walk along this creek 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 is really holding the whole the whole 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.510
 week the whole day is just off 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.780
 and begins to melt me find 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.770
 probably interesting how much we from 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 Water can learn what it is all about 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.140
 really great teacher if you are loud 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.750
 really disturbing and looking 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 if you were in fresh water in his fcn 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.520
 if we do it seawater 1 1 whole 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.790
 incredibly soft is elemental 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.820
 no matter how many stones are in the bathroom 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.460
 The water always finds it 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.970
 easy elegant way and get ahead 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.110
 to move in the river has one 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.470
 devotion with which simply sink 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.780
 lets flow 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 and what I think is nice 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.880
 something incessant you can appreciate here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.850
 an hour at creek 14 and the water 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.040
 as it is full of devotion and then you can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.580
 come the next day and the water 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.479
 flows with devotion and I think that 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.409
 for the areas and so we hold on 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.479
 we create where we say no me 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.970
 do not let life flow anymore 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.420
 I find the water incredible 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.920
 healing because it invites us again 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 of course not return to this 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.770
 the water runs like hard edges 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.569
 and that's just how I got soft 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.030
 get to know breathing 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.209
 I have always compared my breath 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.610
 with a plus 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.819
 and in the beginning, this species was in flux 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 small gullies very little 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.280
 life energy flows through and more 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.769
 I let him in for me 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.090
 really devotion to come in this 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:36.239
 Soft flow around as free twelfth with 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.590
 become the time and the more he has 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.069
 these inner walls and those inner ones 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.430
 distortions 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.409
 gently rinsed and set aside 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.959
 my desire is if you have the opportunity 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.989
 have now in the summer bad seeds and very 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.200
 down to the water then uses the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.560
 opportunity and watch the water like that 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.950
 she was the essence of what flag was 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.989
 which tells what it teaches and sets 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.709
 be quiet for a while a river 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.109
 and just watch the flow and 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.410
 where is this flow in me can i 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:19.810
 yes yes there was life 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.069
 yes that is little inspiration for you 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.140
 and then we go on ours now 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:31.260
 small hike and i wish you 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.260
 a wonderful day to something good
