interesting each sort of watch where
it's<00:00:23.220> analog<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> same<00:00:24.420> time<00:00:24.630> is

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it's analog but at the same time is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.290 
it's analog but at the same time is
digital<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.580> saying<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> sense

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
digital and I'm saying that in the sense

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390 
digital and I'm saying that in the sense
that<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.080> look<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> time<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.099> not

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that if you look at a time here it's not

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.659 
that if you look at a time here it's not
your<00:00:29.730> regular<00:00:30.029> analog<00:00:30.740> power<00:00:31.740> hand<00:00:32.009> seconds

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
your regular analog power hand seconds

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.580 
your regular analog power hand seconds
and<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.329> stuff<00:00:33.570> there's<00:00:34.290> nothing<00:00:34.530> like

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and all that stuff there's nothing like

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.350 
and all that stuff there's nothing like
that<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.180> see

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
that going on here so what you can see

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
that going on here so what you can see
front<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.809> ease<00:00:37.110> some<00:00:37.890> thick<00:00:38.160> circles

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
front of you ease some thick circles

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.180 
front of you ease some thick circles
some<00:00:38.969> thick<00:00:39.180> lines<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> outer<00:00:40.079> area<00:00:40.559> so

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
some thick lines on the outer area so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
some thick lines on the outer area so
that<00:00:41.280> actually<00:00:41.520> how<00:00:41.640> hand<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that actually how hand and then if you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
that actually how hand and then if you
look<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.350> between<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.860> smaller<00:00:44.280> ones

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
look at in between the smaller ones

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.029 
look at in between the smaller ones
smaller<00:00:45.059> blocks<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.600> -<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> minute<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
smaller blocks there - a minute so the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.190 
smaller blocks there - a minute so the
minute<00:00:47.280> saying<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.149> about<00:00:48.840> nearly

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
minute saying it's just about nearly

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.130 
minute saying it's just about nearly
half<00:00:49.410> 12<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.550> nearly<00:00:51.090> 12:30<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
half 12 so that's nearly 12:30 there so

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.330 
half 12 so that's nearly 12:30 there so
if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.289> look<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.920> adjust<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
if you look on there you can adjust the
