00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to consistency a good solid nutrition

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.119 
to consistency a good solid nutrition
program<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> training<00:00:43.500> so

program the right kind of training so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
program the right kind of training so
incorporating<00:00:44.430> hit<00:00:45.090> training<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.870> your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
incorporating hit training with your

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.040 
incorporating hit training with your
really<00:00:46.770> good<00:00:46.950> nutrition<00:00:47.550> program<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.480> weight

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
really good nutrition program and weight

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200 
really good nutrition program and weight
training<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.920> build<00:00:50.160> muscle<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.700> those<00:00:50.850> areas

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
training to build muscle in those areas

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689 
training to build muscle in those areas
there's<00:00:51.449> no<00:00:51.570> such<00:00:51.809> thing<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.260> spot<00:00:53.160> reduction

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
there's no such thing as spot reduction

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.869 
there's no such thing as spot reduction
so<00:00:54.300> basically<00:00:55.110> anywhere<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.770> hold<00:00:56.190> fat<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so basically anywhere you hold fat is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.389 
so basically anywhere you hold fat is
going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.020> last<00:00:58.320> place<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.250> know

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
going to be the last place to go I know

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.920 
going to be the last place to go I know
that's<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> last<00:01:00.090> thing<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.750> hear

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's the last thing you want to hear

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.299 
that's the last thing you want to hear
but<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.289> true<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.039> keep<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.149> keep

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
but it's true so keep at it keep

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.090 
but it's true so keep at it keep
incorporating<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.339> weight<00:01:05.580> training<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.319 
feel I would do best at that's a great
question<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> obviously<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.970> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> do

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
question so obviously you want to do

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.170 
question so obviously you want to do
division<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> enjoy<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.920> being<00:01:38.850> said

if you do hold quite a bit of muscle I

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.200

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
most of the bikini competitors that I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.240 
most of the bikini competitors that I
work<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:16.790> are<00:02:17.240> not<00:02:17.780> super<00:02:18.260> super<00:02:18.770> low<00:02:18.950> when

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
work with are not super super low when

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.900 
work with are not super super low when
they<00:02:19.340> get<00:02:19.490> on<00:02:19.580> stage<00:02:19.790> not<00:02:20.090> as<00:02:20.240> low<00:02:20.420> as<00:02:20.690> figure

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
they get on stage not as low as figure

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.330 
they get on stage not as low as figure
but<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.240> division<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.140> changing<00:02:24.650> too<00:02:24.860> it's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
but the division is changing too it's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.190 
but the division is changing too it's
constantly<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.330> sport<00:02:26.630> itself<00:02:26.750> is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
constantly the sport itself is

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.530 
constantly the sport itself is
constantly<00:02:27.770> evolving<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.790> would<00:02:29.239> say<00:02:29.390> if

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
constantly evolving so I would say if

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.690 
constantly evolving so I would say if
it's<00:02:29.720> your<00:02:29.840> first<00:02:29.870> show<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.310> always

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it's your first show what I always

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.330 
it's your first show what I always
suggest<00:02:32.170> get<00:02:33.170> more<00:02:33.380> stage<00:02:33.680> time<00:02:33.709> if<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.310> can

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
suggest get more stage time if you can

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.880 
suggest get more stage time if you can

you'll<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.110> adapt<00:03:03.590> your<00:03:03.769> training

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
you'll have to adapt your training

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.830 
you'll have to adapt your training
you'll<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.489> change<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.090> style<00:03:05.720> of

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
training that you do in the gym I also

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.960 
training that you do in the gym I also
think<00:03:08.569> that<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.989> should<00:03:09.530> probably<00:03:09.970> contact

think that you should probably contact

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.500 
think that you should probably contact
somebody<00:03:11.480> who<00:03:12.019> knows<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.410> sport<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:14.390> know
