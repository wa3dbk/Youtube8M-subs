 game that raised blisters so bad 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.630
 finished that there was a game that did not 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.450
 did more than tarnish the good name of 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.610
 sony want and this second installment has 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.320
 a bit of hype and personally I 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.239
 I did not expect much from him after the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.700
 disaster that was in the first delivery 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.860
 in this way after two years after the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.960
 release of episode one arrives are 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.390
 of the hand of teis continuing thus his 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.009
 fight against doctor &amp; mack and that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.479
 invites all of us to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.479
 accompany them in this adventure 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.830
 the story without much importance the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.170
 truth puts us behind the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.570
 sonic cd q metal events 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.430
 sonic badly wounded and in the making preparing 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.440
 new and malicious plans that have 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 what to do with the approach once again 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.640
 from the little planet 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.010
 in sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 2 we 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.420
 we will find up to a total of four 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.550
 zones divided into three acts 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.580
 independent of the mandatory 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.620
 final boss in each of these zones and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 not only that at the end of our 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 travel we will find a final phase 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.790
 with two acts of final exercise is like this 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.770
 as the obligatory special phases 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.660
 special phases clearly inspired 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.660
 in the sonic megadrive classic 2 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.939
 two 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 although it can be considered that it is not 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.390
 excessively long game especially for 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.310
 the price that we have to pay for it 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.709
 we will have many types of zones to 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.150
 our disposition in these areas 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.099
 we will find places to take advantage 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.840
 the speed of the pet sega zones 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.659
 of exploration the classic zones of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.450
 water in short a very short game but 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.189
 very varied graphically has improved 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 noticeably from the first delivery 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.450
 but unfortunately it can be considered 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.980
 that may not be up to the standards of others 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 platform titles that we can 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.329
 find today sale 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.950
 surely this is so to maintain 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.370
 a continuation line with the first 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.530
 delivery 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.900
 the scenes shine in their great majority 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.269
 in an incredible way with an aesthetic 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.040
 typical of the franchise and that thanks to 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.019
 a totally three-dimensional format 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.940
 will give a life and a color to the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.819
 screens that we have not seen in much 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.140
 time in the sonic game for another 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.299
 side the animations of the characters 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.549
 they are more worked than in the previous 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.489
 episode and we will notice one more movement 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.470
 less rigid natural and in short more 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.790
 similar to the classic sones that 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.790
 it was what the fans asked 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.810
 as for the sound of the game has also 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.310
 improved since its first delivery at 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.290
 throughout the adventure we 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.420
 they will accompany electronic melodies that 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.150
 they will try to look in vain at the time 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.850
 of the 16 bits of wax are not melodies 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.010
 bad but if we notice them sometimes 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.930
 something is so very fortunate if the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.850
 we compare with the classic chapters of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.980
 management and management 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.990
 as for its sound effects have 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.700
 maintained that of the classic games by 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.120
 what here has not been variation 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.120
 any 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.020
 in terms of its gameplay we will find 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.479
 much better control than the one 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.490
 we found in the first chapter in 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.470
 this episode 2 we will find 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.380
 well balanced control and that responds 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.940
 without many problems we will have our 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.830
 arrangement three types of movements 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.960
 new cooperative specials between 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.669
 sonic and teis which we will have to 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.550
 use with great skill to advance in 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.530
 the story aside as I already mentioned the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.810
 have been corrected with respect to 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.970
 to episode 1 this I imagine has 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.949
 been at the request of the fans but still 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.169
 still does not keep that classic cut 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.550
 that there was in the previous sonic but 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.070
 despite this small detail 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.310
 we will enjoy a lot with this game and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.349
 we are fans of the hedgehog or not as to 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.449
 the difficulty the difficulty of the game is 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.550
 pretty tight is a fun game 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.349
 that will force us to play several times 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.940
 each of the zones to find the 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.669
 secrets that hide in him if 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.919
 we want to get all the juice and like 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.110
 curiosity if we still have the episodes 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.419
 of ozone and 4 we will get access to a 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.550
 exclusive area where we will handle metal 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.159
 sonic here we will tell you his story 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.240
 from its reactivation until its return to 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.190
 little 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.470
 but this episode only gets 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.400
 free when downloading episode 1 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.400
 and episode 2 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.440
 and not only that if it happened to us once 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.350
 We are in a single player mode 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.630
 the game proposes a cooperative mode 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.550
 online locally to do the 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.580
 most entertaining game 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.980
 in conclusion this is in the heights 4 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.510
 episode 2 is a worthy sequel to a 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.250
 decaffeinated first game 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.920
 we have a fun game 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.210
 Entertaining recommended for fans 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.770
 of the hedgehog or any good 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.379
 platforms 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.000
 yes, if possible, I would recommend 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.160
 expect some special strong or 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.530
 discount then the game for what 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.530
 offers is quite expensive at this time
