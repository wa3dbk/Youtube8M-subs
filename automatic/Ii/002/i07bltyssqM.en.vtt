00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.330
 welcome to my cooking channel today in 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 the kitchen now I bring you a recipe 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.790
 very special where fruit salad is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.820
 called ambros is already fruit salad 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.099
 It is really delicious and is ideal for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.990
 special occasions I am going to show you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.690
 what are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.390
 use first of all let's have 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.629
 various canned fruits all well 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 trained and without any of the juice here I 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.210
 I have the contents of a large can of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 pineapple in pieces line 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 A large can of fruit cocktail is 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.540
 say mixed fruits mixed 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.760
 the contents of a small can of 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.530
 tangerines this is one of the flavors 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 characteristic of the salad 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.159
 ambrosio and also some cherries for 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.560
 decorate later 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.749
 on the other hand for the dressing of this 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.689
 salad let's use half a liter of 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:13.440
 whole cream that we then go to assemble 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:18.180
 shake 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:22.190
 100 grams of grated coconut 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.680
 200 grams of sour cream 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.220
 about two or three tablespoons of 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.560
 impalpable sugar 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 and the second characteristic ingredient 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.570
 of this salad are marshmallows 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.180
 marshmallows here I have the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.100
 big that I'll cut in 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.340
 bits and you get the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.050
 little ones better than they are pretty much 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.050
 about 100 150 grams 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.440
 well let's start with the cream 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.030
 we will place in the machine to beat 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.030
 this can also be a beater by hand 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.280
 without any problem what we are going to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.810
 search is a type consistency 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.580
 chantilly 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.100
 once the cream is half beaten 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.710
 let's go incorporating 2 to 3 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.140
 teaspoons of the impalpable sugar that 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.720
 we had my prepared let's start 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.370
 with a low speed so that it does not 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.840
 splash 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.840
 and then we will go up 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 in this list to points or feel 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.780
 now let's take a goal as much 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.459
 deep and big that we have for more 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.010
 that after the salad the back we pass 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.900
 to another bowl goes another source is important 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.870
 work comfortable because we are going to have 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.519
 that we incorporate various ingredients 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.160
 to start first with what would be the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:59.610
 dressing or the sauce of this salad 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.610
 what is a base of our mounted cream 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.750
 an important detail of course this 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.780
 Fruit salad is not exactly 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.010
 low in calories so I told them the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.040
 principle that is really for 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.960
 special occasions from time to time if 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.180
 you get the light versions of 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.600
 the cream of the sour cream can be 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.060
 replace without any problem 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.260
 let's add now 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.019
 the sour cream 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.590
 The cream recovers neutralize function 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.260
 a little to balance a little bit all the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.500
 sweet of fruit and cream and 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.560
 coconut and it really adds a very very 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.080
 special this salad 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.069
 and a big spoon we are going to mix 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.499
 well the two creams 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.349
 can see you here is a 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:57.180
 pretty important amount here is this 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.829
 Salad is really very creamy 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.030
 and that's why it's really ideal for 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.030
 serve it as a dessert 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.359
 It is well mixed 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.069
 I advise you to make the dressing first 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.409
 because without beginning we do with the 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.750
 fruits afterwards it gets harder 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.079
 integrate everything 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.910
 very well this is already well mixed 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.910
 then now let's add the wool 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.240
 the cocktail and a very easy salad 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.240
 prepare 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.240
 the tangerines 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.749
 and let's start slowly with a lot 

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:44.099
 Be careful not to break fruit 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:44.099
 mix with the cream 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.290
 it is not necessary to add sugar 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.080
 additional because really with the sweet 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.180
 of the fruits is enough I only 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.340
 add two teaspoons to the cream 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.340
 of impalpable sugar or icing sugar 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.000
 you see that the proportion of fruit and 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.380
 of cream is practically the same 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.230
 really a lot of cream 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.390
 Now let's add the coconut to the roast 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.560
 this is really a very special touch 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.560
 of milk salad 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.770
 and the other fruits are inevitable if 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.220
 you prefer for example instead 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.590
 from nothing 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.080
 put peaches there is no problem 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.980
 it's just that the lullaby and the little are two 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.240
 flavors that are really good 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.240
 mix everything well 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.220
 and finally we are going to add the most 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.200
 bad that I already have cut are 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.849
 quite difficult to cut because 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.720
 they are a bit sticky 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.570
 but I got it 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.990
 well let's add all marx me 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.970
 I'm going to keep stirring until 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.750
 all the ingredients are well 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.750
 incorporated 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.189
 there are more less colors and this is 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:14.869
 also really a very funny touch 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:17.639
 optically to the salad in this case 

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:19.949
 I'm using white 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.760
 but that said it to your liking 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.390
 They can also use colors 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.250
 we mix everything very well 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.110
 and well this salad was prepared 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.060
 pretty fast but now detail 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.180
 important is that it must be refrigerated 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:38.140
 at least three to four hours the case 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.660
 ideal would be the day before so it's 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.640
 an ideal salad to prepare it on 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.800
 day before any party or some 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.460
 family meeting 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.460
 The next day is when you know best 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.760
 this salad is already very mixed 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.980
 so we only have left 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.750
 put it in the refrigerator at least 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.300
 three to four hours before being able to 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.850
 serve them well our salad 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.950
 ambrÃ³s is already ready was in the 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.430
 four hours refrigerator cost quite 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.590
 wait to try it but it's worth it 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.230
 I decorated it here with the little ears 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.750
 they had reserved and here I already have 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.390
 two glasses served ready to be 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.310
 enjoyed but before I'm going to 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.290
 sprinkle with a little bit of crispy 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.169
 of hazelnuts can also be of 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.479
 almonds 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.409
 a little touch of crispy is very good 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.409
 with this salad 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:35.309
 and well I recommend this dessert for 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:37.919
 a special occasion to surprise 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:41.009
 someone who we love a lot for a dinner 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:43.259
 I hope romantic is 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:47.029
 recent have you liked to taste it 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.029
 and see you in the next 

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.070
 ah
