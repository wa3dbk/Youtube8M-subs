00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.680
 and greet everyone is mister qc 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.020
 and today I'm going to talk to you about a 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.330
 game mode named flag capture 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.310
 to play there no need of fashion 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 just go on the ip and I 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.390
 you will put in the description the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.970
 flag catch can be played at 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.859
 many in team for more fun I 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.529
 will teach you everything about this game mode 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.150
 inspired by team fortress 2 good video 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.980
 a catch of flags is done in 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.260
 team one blue one red 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.969
 the goal is to take the wool of the totem 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 from the other team and bring him back 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.260
 as many times as requested but for this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 movie you will have to go through pvp when 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.850
 of a flags capture the goals 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 asked are to capture the flag and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 half and bring him back to his base without getting 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.170
 finally kill the number of times 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.350
 asked too and kill the most times 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.140
 possible it's not necessary but good for 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.489
 those who like pvp so what 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.489
 now let's move on to the kits 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.770
 the archives very powerful by far thanks 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.750
 at their bow sang they will be a 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.479
 asset for the team when they will make 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.799
 headshots to enemies but and chatting 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.530
 minc or the opponent 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.240
 no matter what kind of his armor 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.240
 however provided with a stone sword they 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.039
 will be a little useful closely despite their 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:53.170
 low melee damage and their 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:56.050
 armor not very protective the soldiers 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.179
 or in other words, soldier will be very 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.920
 useful to melee thanks to their 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.600
 serve to make it and their ep to do 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.490
 thanks to their jump technique they 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.229
 will be able to limit the damage 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.240
 jumping on the walls or on the cliffs 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.369
 this place is a tactical class 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.200
 as for the archers they will not hold 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.560
 not otan vis-a-vis the opinions they do not know 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.560
 not play 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 the students there the nagging class of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.650
 flag catch with you will be able to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.300
 literally shredded your enemies 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 thanks to their steve diaz 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.980
 but beware they are just leaps to 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.980
 typed they are not very strategic 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.840
 the medics the class care he just 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 than to tap his ally to heal him 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.740
 n2 and give him all those meats 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.050
 these classes are really very useful 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.000
 with a nag and yes despite them 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.230
 do not use it's a class 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.420
 which can be decisive during a fan and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.670
 here I hope you have cleared up on this 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.070
