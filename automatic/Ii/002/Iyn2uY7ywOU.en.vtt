need that hustle button for your

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
need that hustle button for your
acceleration<00:01:53.850> okay<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.780> you'll<00:01:55.020> you'll

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
acceleration okay but you'll you'll

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.130 
acceleration okay but you'll you'll
you'll<00:01:55.320> use<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.799> way<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.070> than<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.520> would

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
you'll use it way more than you would

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.969 
you'll use it way more than you would
acceleration<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.229> find<00:01:58.470> it's<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.650> better

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
acceleration I find it's way better

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010

up tying it up so that was good got some

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
up tying it up so that was good got some
stats<00:02:33.360> involved<00:02:34.080> there<00:02:34.230> our<00:02:34.379> passing<00:02:34.799> was<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
stats involved there our passing was a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.470 
stats involved there our passing was a
little<00:02:35.159> bit<00:02:35.280> better<00:02:35.400> time<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.909> attack<00:02:36.209> was

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
little bit better time on attack was

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720 
little bit better time on attack was
definitely<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:36.959> their<00:02:37.080> favorite<00:02:37.440> shots<00:02:37.739> 30<00:02:38.459> 9

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
definitely in their favorite shots 30 9

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.089 
definitely in their favorite shots 30 9
224<00:02:39.060> most<00:02:39.930> those<00:02:40.079> came<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> power<00:02:40.680> play<00:02:40.920> so

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
224 most those came on the power play so

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.280 
224 most those came on the power play so
it<00:02:41.190> was<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> result<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.909> all<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.659> penalties<00:02:42.900> we

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
it was a result of all the penalties we

took that they got so many shots but the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.149 
took that they got so many shots but the

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
faceoffs you can see I almost tripled

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.970 
faceoffs you can see I almost tripled
his<00:02:47.340> twenty<00:02:48.030> nine<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.420> ten<00:02:48.829> breakaways<00:02:49.829> we

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
his twenty nine to ten breakaways we

at the 3 stars I'm assuming I'm probably
no<00:02:56.190> I'm<00:02:56.370> number<00:02:56.640> three<00:02:56.670> because<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.569> other

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
no I'm number three because the other

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.319 
no I'm number three because the other
two<00:02:57.840> guys<00:02:57.989> got<00:02:58.230> 45<00:02:58.920> points<00:02:59.310> each<00:02:59.459> but<00:03:00.150> i<00:03:00.180> ended

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
is a little bit slower because of the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.090 
is a little bit slower because of the
height<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:41.640> weight<00:05:41.960> or<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.020> height<00:05:43.560> more<00:05:43.890> so

I bring the guys hike down to 5 foot 10
5<00:05:46.410> 11<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:46.980> max<00:05:47.220> if<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.580> were<00:05:47.730> you<00:05:47.820> if<00:05:47.880> you

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
5 11 of the max if I were you if you

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.310 
5 11 of the max if I were you if you
want<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.330> really<00:05:48.450> take<00:05:48.660> advantage<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:49.200> this

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
want to really take advantage of this

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.620 
want to really take advantage of this
quickness<00:05:49.790> mind<00:05:50.790> you<00:05:50.940> the<00:05:51.030> height<00:05:51.240> gives<00:05:51.480> you

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
quickness mind you the height gives you

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.880 
quickness mind you the height gives you
a<00:05:51.660> better<00:05:51.810> region<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.290> better<00:05:52.440> faceoff

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
a better region a better faceoff

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.790 
a better region a better faceoff
percentage<00:05:53.360> so<00:05:54.360> really<00:05:54.630> it's<00:05:54.750> kind<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.590> you

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
percentage so really it's kind of you

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.440 
percentage so really it's kind of you
know<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:55.950> got<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.160> give<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.700> take<00:05:56.910> and<00:05:57.150> take<00:05:57.300> to

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450
