00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.790

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.059
 hello everyone I hope you go 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.320

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.900
 today to tell you about saint 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.939
 valentine 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.980
 and yes I am sophie very romantic I 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.500
 could not not talk about the saint 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.239
 valentine you imagine and obviously 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.380
 as every year once conquered 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.670
 end of year festivities do not start 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.089
 directly from the preparations of saint 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.310
 valentine 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.500
 I come today to help all 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.449
 people who a friend or a friend 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.110
 girlfriend and who want to make them a 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.989
 small but homemade gift made 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.460
 and who do not necessarily want to 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.539
 spend money or just 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.600
 that they want to do something 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.890
 likewise I come back with those here 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.890
 is a way 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.250
 the black ball so it's a map of 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.830
 Valentine's Day 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.670
 with a nice little ribbon and actually 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.530
 it's a magic card of con when 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.330
 louvre d'accueil she reveals us a 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 little secret message 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.990
 that's when it's closed on Saturday this 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 is when we slow down 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.579
 so she helps us if you want 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.090
 know how I realized this little 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.409
 map 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 stay tuned and I'm here again for you 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 so show how to make this pretty 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.570
 little card of the valentine's day 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.899
 I show you a little the principle 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.000
 so when we remove the ribbon the map 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.670
 seems to be simple in appearance 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.429
 but in fact she reveals us a little 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.939
 secret message canton louvre canton la 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.549
 closes 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.259
 you see that this message disappears and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.049
 you will see that to realize it 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.399
 it's very simple to do it yourself 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.039
 will need a 15 cm angle tract 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.420
 on 21 cm that you will fold each 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.630
 side at 5.2 cm so as to achieve the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.549
 small windows on your map 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.390
 then you will need a rectangle 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.250
 of 7 x 15 cm and that's the rectangle that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.569
 will come creeping in here indoors 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.390
 then you will need two 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.609
 small squares about 5 x 5 cm that 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:31.109
 you go foot to 0 5 cm on each 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:33.320
 see here and that's what will form our 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.000
 two small windows here on the side 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.790
 so we're going right started following 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.209
 the first thing to do is you 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.760
 bring your big rectangle of 15 x 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.440
 21 cm that you looted each time 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.840
 to five goals of centimeters on the side 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.190
 and you decide cartoon 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.170
 shape that you will reveal 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.870
 here then as it is the valentine's day 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.540
 I wanted to show with hacker and if 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.239
 I make them smaller to have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.180
 easy for your heart to be enough 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.920
 symmetrical I made a little boss 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.230
 that I simply put on it and that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.670
 I have 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.530
 cut out so I made the con tour and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.010
 then I cut them out and that's what 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.409
 it gives 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.480
 once you've done that you 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.900
 bring you your rectangle of 7 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.629
 x 15 cm you will be placed in the middle of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.879
 your card will you close your 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.370
 windows and you take a pencil you 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.569
 go back to the small choir on the small 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.640
 chorus or on the form you will have 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.319
 decided to let appear and you 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.450
 go then cut I advise you 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.290
 to do it with the cutter so I 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.200
 cutter but be careful 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.709
 when you use speakers not to 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.709
 To hurt you 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.160
 so that's it then you put it for 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.280
 check that it gives the effect 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.239
 desired so here it goes once you 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.859
 did that now we'll decide the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.739
 little word of the little message we're going 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.530
 leave what we are going to leave behind and 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.120
 at the opening of the map have no - 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.900
 I'll go quickly for you 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.190
 show a little bit just do it 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.349
 what I'm going to do is you 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.739
 can very well write directly the 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.940
 message on the on the big square but 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.500
 I decided to take a color 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.690
 which is not very different I'm going 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.579
 just place like that and I'm going 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.599
 write the little word on it so what 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:26.919
 I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:26.919
 directly the collar have checked 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:40.640
 fefa be in the heart that's it and 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.260
 then I'll be able to write a little 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:52.280
 same message like that it's been going for a long time 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:55.040
 we will write a little word here once 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.960
 that it's done she'll be able to paste this 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.670
 rectangle too but beware you 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.010
 do not go snarling put it there because 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.540
 you will have to let the 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.970
 small windows that will cover your 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.280
 message so what are we going to do is 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.780
 that we will stick justifying above and 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.530
 so all the down here to be sure of 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.180
 favor of nonsense 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.479
 so let's go to kolda and 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.479
 right here 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.050
 here 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:27.449
 here 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.949
 once these necklaces 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.300
 2 girls that fit together 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.669
 perfectly so you see our little 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.199
 message is remote now what we 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.020
 will do is we will bring two 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.400
 small belgium reminded to the east of 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.089
 little flap that will find you 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.249
 message and we will place glue on 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.569
 small investigations that are art 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.759
 so I recommend using 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.169
 double-sided if you ever decide not to 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.279
 not at all not make this card for 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.960
 valentine's day is made for example 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.490
 for a little girl who is going to have fun at 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.319
 the worker to assert that the farm and the 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.939
 price the quality of everything does it because 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.499
 that it's stronger but me when 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.599
 I did not do it with the means of the edge 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:02.839
 and I'm going to just use the 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.839
 glue 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.790
 for you 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.350
 here 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.610
 we just put the little rectangle here 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.940
 so that they cover about 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:26.410
 half of the message and then we go 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.820
 come close the map on the 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.560
 bank to put a long time I 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.160
 must be placed and then we want them 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.440
 girls I'm kicked a little bit and we 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.770
 check that it's closing and that it's 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.270
 open well like that you're here once 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.160
 that we did on both sides here is this 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.680
 that we get so that's the mechanism of 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.270
 base of your map that saw you summer 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.130
 very very simple to make 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.810
 then you can decorate it as 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.550
 you want to see you here that I have 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.260
 decorated by making small cherries 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.240
 I added a little ribbon because 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.410
 because his ex was more romantic 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.050
 and find out why it made me 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.070
 think of a box of chocolates as I 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.610
 am very greedy I could not 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.460
 to prevent me from 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.820
 and here you see I sets and 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.830
 as I wanted it here I hope that the 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.080
 video will have you more than I hope that 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.890
 you 're going to test it that you 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.900
 please 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.430
 next time I'll suggest you 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.800
 to make with me this map which 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.930
 all in relief and that is also simple to 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.410
 realize that the one I just got from you 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.850
 show 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.320
 so here I tell you very soon 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.550
 for an upcoming video is here there 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.550
 pamper yourself provisions
