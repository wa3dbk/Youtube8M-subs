00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.740
 confidence without reflectors 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.050

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.529
 I'm not going to feed people 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 in that sheet of foundling and the room that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.769
 Latin is the story of a dad 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.510
 millionaire who realizes that his 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.520
 children do not know how to make money or how 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 spend it have no direction in their 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.780
 lives and they are pulling the spiders I have 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.780
 an idea and I need you to help me 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.780
 but it is so much to receive a lesson 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.960
 do it on my blog on my blog 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.550
 xavi in my mind it was always like 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.620
 metieras a roberto palazuelos ya homero 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.629
 Simpson to a blender the challenge as the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.640
 of the movie I think I was taking these 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.580
 archetypes are not as so present 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.509
 in the mind of my kingdom with the girl 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.509
 strawberry the hipster 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.440
 I present to you the largest vat of the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.440
 world the hipster 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.619
 and the princess gives them a news 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.780
 and that by the end of the film 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.930
 already has its good already the character I'm 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.930
 or not 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.039
 do not 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.969
 it's the seal it gives is like when you 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 you make a movie that you say already salt 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.200
 it was like all the work and now live it 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 it did not happen to me in its passage by fas 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.340
 this clash of socioeconomic levels and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.799
 cultural 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.369
 I thought it was great because it shows 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.259
 that happiness is not in money and 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.460
 it also shows that there is nothing else 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.979
 important that the value of the family 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.959
 keep enjoying this movie here 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.959
 in the Latin cinema we the nobles
