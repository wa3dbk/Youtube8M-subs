00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.170
 already the people today bringing a tutorial 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.010
 realistic painting is a good effect 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.019
 Nice quick and super easy to do 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.440
 come on we will do first 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.480
 Duplicate the image twice 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 against the j against oj 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.900
 Now we're going to get a thing of color. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 in it only one hundred to the colors of the image 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 Sacra is just a little bit, it 's nothing much 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.450
 the control also called now 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.379
 work on other high filter 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.489
 frequency you will leave the radius in 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:50.059
 2005 pixels 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.059
 Okay, now you come here. 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:04.430
 light of the use of fusion will leave 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.619
 marked the last of the modules 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 on this topic I do not remember how it is 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:17.960
 in English but it is the last of the modes 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.979
 right here in English is ok now 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:27.080
 you will give a unified control 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:31.010
 now you come image the rotation of naja 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.950
 90 ° filler to it will stay like this 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:41.090
 the use of fusion the same thing only 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.200
 they give an okay image quote 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.620
 again 90 ° clockwise 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:02:00.220
 filter use of the same fusion 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.220
 setting ok image 90 ° skip the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 diffusion of configuration here and now 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:16.390
 back I'm normal right deco 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:20.420
 now it's fine it's blurry right 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.800
 Now we're going to filter 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.760
 clear application of them from God 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:34.010
 the settings are exactly those 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.340
 intensity 100% radius 1.0 pixel reduce 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.290
 10% noise and taking pictures of the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.739
 ocean of an ok, now we go 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.570
 wait till we get a little bit here and 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:54.830
 People are not going to have a filter 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.340
 again blurring of focuses of 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.360
 surface 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:08.590
 it will also leave so ray 50 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.690
 linear pixels 15 levels of an ok esse 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.860
 When I saw the tutorial this is the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.700
 final result 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.709
 sure I found it still a little foggy 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:26.980
 so I put on another mask of 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:31.030
 Sharpness is 100% radius in 1.0 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.239
 pixels training serious level soc 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.989
 and this was a result that I got 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:42.870
 I hope you like it 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.870
 A hug to everyone and until next time
