you think that explains why there's such

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.920 
you think that explains why there's such
a<00:03:16.470> high<00:03:16.740> dump<00:03:17.130> rate<00:03:17.430> for<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.820> breath<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
a high dump rate for this breath that I

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.960 
a high dump rate for this breath that I
think<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.770> reasons<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.520> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
think is one of the reasons and the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.290 
think is one of the reasons and the
other<00:03:21.120> reason<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.600> think<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.940> sharp<00:03:23.940> eyes<00:03:24.120> are

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
other reason I think is a sharp eyes are

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.960 
other reason I think is a sharp eyes are
portrayed<00:03:24.540> as<00:03:24.690> being<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.170> wrinkly<00:03:25.500> dog<00:03:25.860> all<00:03:26.700> you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.880 
they lose it as the adult grows the
wrinkles<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.040> away<00:03:35.420> by<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.480> face<00:03:36.840> they<00:03:37.620> tend
