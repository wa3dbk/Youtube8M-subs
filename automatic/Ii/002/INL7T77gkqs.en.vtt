October<00:00:18.390> first<00:00:18.570> you'll<00:00:19.199> notice<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.560> first

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
October first you'll notice at first

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.349 
October first you'll notice at first
glance<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.369> much<00:00:20.490> more<00:00:20.640> portable<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
glance that it's much more portable and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.420 
glance that it's much more portable and
there's<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> reason<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.100> wanted<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
there's a reason for that we wanted to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890 
there's a reason for that we wanted to
ensure<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.850> consumers<00:00:24.150> could<00:00:24.600> bring<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
ensure that consumers could bring it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
ensure that consumers could bring it
with<00:00:25.019> them<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.260> lot<00:00:25.350> easier<00:00:25.580> it's<00:00:26.580> fifteen

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
with them a lot easier it's fifteen

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.400 
with them a lot easier it's fifteen
percent<00:00:27.240> lighter<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> forty-three<00:00:28.289> percent

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
percent lighter and forty-three percent

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.160 
percent lighter and forty-three percent
smaller<00:00:28.740> than<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> PSP<00:00:29.609> 3004<00:00:30.449> those<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> have

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
smaller than the PSP 3004 those you have

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.350 
smaller than the PSP 3004 those you have
the<00:00:31.320> PSP<00:00:31.560> 1000<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> original<00:00:32.850> product<00:00:33.210> it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the PSP 1000 the original product it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.000 
the PSP 1000 the original product it's
actually<00:00:33.660> forty-three<00:00:34.200> percent<00:00:34.350> lighter<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
actually forty-three percent lighter and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340 
actually forty-three percent lighter and
fifty<00:00:35.309> six<00:00:35.520> percent<00:00:35.610> smaller<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.719> much<00:00:37.110> more

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
fifty six percent smaller so a much more

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.750 
fifty six percent smaller so a much more
portable<00:00:37.620> product<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> noticed<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> can

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
portable product you noticed you can

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.040 
portable product you noticed you can
just<00:00:38.910> take<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> away<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.899> go

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
just take it here and away you go

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.720 
just take it here and away you go
there's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.829> number<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.129> very<00:00:41.219> nice<00:00:41.460> things

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
there's a number of very nice things

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209 
there's a number of very nice things
about<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> PSP<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.469> most<00:00:43.800> notably

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
about the PSP go I think most notably

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.240 
about the PSP go I think most notably
that<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:45.239> built-in<00:00:45.719> memory<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.590> 16<00:00:47.039> gigs

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that there's built-in memory so 16 gigs

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
that there's built-in memory so 16 gigs
of<00:00:47.399> memory<00:00:47.520> will<00:00:48.450> allow<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> download<00:00:49.020> a

go we have the memory stick micro which
I'm<00:01:13.680> holding<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.220> hands<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> 2gig

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
I'm holding here in my hands is a 2gig

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.640 
I'm holding here in my hands is a 2gig
model<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.049> much<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.350> smaller

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
model you can see it's much much smaller

model you can see it's much much smaller
fits<00:01:17.189> into<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.490> port<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.299> allows<00:01:19.140> for

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
fits into this port here and allows for

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.850 
fits into this port here and allows for
the<00:01:19.590> 16<00:01:20.250> gigs<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.729> grow<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.299> at<00:01:22.229> market<00:01:22.710> today

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the 16 gigs to grow so at market today

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
the 16 gigs to grow so at market today
there's<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.610> 2gig<00:01:24.000> there's<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> four<00:01:24.570> gig

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there's the 2gig there's a four gig

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
there's the 2gig there's a four gig
there's<00:01:24.960> an<00:01:25.020> eight<00:01:25.110> gig<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> 16<00:01:26.009> gig<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
there's an eight gig and a 16 gig so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
there's an eight gig and a 16 gig so
much<00:01:27.540> more<00:01:27.780> memory<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.470> able<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.829> add

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
much more memory that you're able to add

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
much more memory that you're able to add
so<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> content<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so if you do have all that content that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.480 
so if you do have all that content that
you<00:01:31.259> want<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> bring<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> PSP<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you want to bring into the PSP go you
