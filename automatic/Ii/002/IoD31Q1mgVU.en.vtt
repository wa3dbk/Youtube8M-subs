 namely for my children in this 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.189
 summer was the vacation time and the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.929

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.949
 cooked whole and then fried 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.529
 vanessa lands at daniel korthaus in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.830
 Wuppertal in the kitchen is not pretty 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.019
 but who can actually nothing 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 add 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.439
 say I 've never had such a whole 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.970
 thing in my hand and I have 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.500
 because I see my clearer from the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.989
 fishmonger the poor but i have 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 make aware of being so close 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 Now I can buy the whole 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.510
 the yes probably I would just 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.510
 to ask the fishmonger ask 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.309
 Do you remember generation first 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 just before eaten as the first white 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.449
 hurry earlier 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.640
 i had everything i had as a child 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.699
 nothing was female thighs before 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.129
 or snails or or just like that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.140
 exotic seafood frutti di mare 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.010
 a mother says one of my first 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 words was to try and that is 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 Naturally 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 Maybe that's why I am also a cook 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.020
 each has become a part of it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.020
 his is very clear 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.090
 cheap cook was basically needed 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.920
 I do not have wine for 15 euros and 78 euros 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.160
 pension so degenerate I keep looking 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.490
 look, the will be so festnetz 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240
 Almost on the knife of course 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.460
 to ruin 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 I had not heard anything else right now 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.610
 beautiful 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.710
 a bit garlic yes that nice 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.470
 sharp cut this you can 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.250
 We also look at how fit you are 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.250
 managed onion 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.980
 he does not fresh garlic 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 That's what we see here 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.970
 Half an hour you did not look 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.410
 look where are you early estimate 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.640
 grunde just over with a knife 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.550
 he has to cook a bit more 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.980
 nobody has his own beautiful far 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.970
 go in and out a fork will too 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.410
 that means he can not do that anymore 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.270
 have a lot of resistance when we have this year 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.710
 has to feel like one 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.750
 has or soft potato-the 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:05.330
 finished this color is now in the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.430
 water yes there is a similar way 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.770
 believe in shrimp for example too 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.420
 This precise red because of the dye 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:17.680
 only destroyed by the heat 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.680
 this gray and then the red card 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.050
 beautiful is that judge not at all 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.330
 cheesy or exhausting it smells like 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.750
 sea ​​after vacation somehow uncertain in 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.750
 the direction 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:10.530
 with a without tried that works too 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.920
 only really good is too long but 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.049
 It can be a certain temperature once 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.510
 strip so always make only the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:29.039
 surplus even to gilbert through 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:32.150
 the beak out so that is still today 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.150
 like to try dirt 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.820
 8th 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.560
 Celery I always do that when I do 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.530
 Now before I'm up here 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.180
 I want to wear it 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.690
 we have to do everything exactly the same as the medium 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.880
 Slip and somehow a little bit 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.630
 and roast the best works too 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.030
 only in relatively little oil so little 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.710
 oil and, above all, space for that 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.710
 really every piece of that to refuse 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.760
 celery 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.620
 Did you ever say I think so 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.610
 believe her best job in the world 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.759
 they are totally right it is so bad 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.440
 to her heartfelt thanks a lot of fun 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.870
 made 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.080
 why many thanks for yours 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.080
