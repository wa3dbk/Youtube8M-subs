00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
chair and the flower detail and then a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.100 
chair and the flower detail and then a
flower<00:05:33.050> crown<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.830> also<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.640> am<00:05:34.760> using<00:05:35.110> natural

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
flower crown and also I am using natural

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.360 
flower crown and also I am using natural
light<00:05:36.260> for<00:05:36.410> this<00:05:36.530> one<00:05:36.710> I<00:05:36.740> do<00:05:36.860> have<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.160> lights

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
light for this one I do have the lights

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.430 
light for this one I do have the lights
on<00:05:37.550> but<00:05:37.850> just<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.060> give<00:05:38.210> an<00:05:38.300> extra<00:05:38.570> light<00:05:38.870> some

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
on but just to give an extra light some

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.570 
on but just to give an extra light some
people<00:05:39.650> would<00:05:39.740> turn<00:05:39.860> them<00:05:40.040> off<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.310> think<00:05:40.490> it's

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
people would turn them off I think it's

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.910 
people would turn them off I think it's
just<00:05:40.670> based<00:05:40.910> on<00:05:41.030> preference<00:05:41.270> I<00:05:41.720> had<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.740> model

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
just based on preference I had the model

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.890 
just based on preference I had the model
first<00:05:43.400> facing<00:05:43.940> this<00:05:44.090> way<00:05:44.150> but<00:05:44.510> then<00:05:44.600> I<00:05:44.660> moved

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
first facing this way but then I moved

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.150 
first facing this way but then I moved
her<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.230> that<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.440> natural<00:05:45.590> light<00:05:45.920> is<00:05:46.040> hitting

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
her so that the natural light is hitting

00:05:46.160 --> 00:06:00.190 
her so that the natural light is hitting
her<00:05:46.970> directly<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:47.570> I<00:05:47.630> moved<00:05:47.840> right<00:05:47.990> an<00:05:48.110> angle

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.090
