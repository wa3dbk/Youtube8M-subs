00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
stand out won't be in that 89 dribbling
which<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.170> absolutely<00:00:16.680> awesome<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.190> you've

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
which is absolutely awesome and you've

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
which is absolutely awesome and you've
won<00:00:17.609> being<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.060> 51<00:00:18.390> physical<00:00:18.840> which<00:00:19.320> is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
won being that 51 physical which is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.679 
won being that 51 physical which is
pretty<00:00:19.890> dreadful<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.910> honest<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.300> they

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pretty dreadful to be honest and they

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.330 
pretty dreadful to be honest and they
both<00:00:21.869> kind<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.350> counteract<00:00:22.980> each<00:00:23.100> other

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
both kind of like counteract each other

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.950 
both kind of like counteract each other
because<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.939> fact<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.210> dribbling<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.720> good

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
because the fact is dribbling so good

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.170 
because the fact is dribbling so good
makes<00:00:25.199> him<00:00:25.380> easy<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.279> evade<00:00:26.640> defenders

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
makes him easy to like evade defenders

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
makes him easy to like evade defenders
but<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> fact<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.109> weak<00:00:28.349> means<00:00:28.650> if<00:00:28.859> they<00:00:29.010> do

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
but the fact is so weak means if they do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.370 
but the fact is so weak means if they do
catch<00:00:29.400> him<00:00:29.429> then<00:00:30.150> he<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.539> very<00:00:31.109> easily

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
catch him then he is very easily

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.380 
catch him then he is very easily
dispossessed<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.969> six<00:00:33.180> games

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
dispossessed as you can see in six games

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
dispossessed as you can see in six games
he's<00:00:33.540> got<00:00:33.660> four<00:00:33.930> times<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.380> grabbed<00:00:34.829> himself

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

four<00:00:35.399> assists<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.630> honest<00:00:36.840> he

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
four assists now to be honest he

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.360 
four assists now to be honest he
probably<00:00:37.140> should<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.440> had<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> more

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
probably should have had and more

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
probably should have had and more
assists<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.450> season

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that's how bad it is but at the main

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.410

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
awesome if you can evade the defenders

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.440 
awesome if you can evade the defenders
keep<00:01:26.189> away<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.090> will<00:01:27.180> definitely

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
keep away from them you will definitely

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.940 
keep away from them you will definitely
have<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> fun<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.229> him<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> issue

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
have a fun time with him but the issue

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
have a fun time with him but the issue
is<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.549> said<00:01:29.670> start<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.600> catch<00:01:30.900> up

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
is as I said start if they do catch up

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.270 
is as I said start if they do catch up
to<00:01:31.200> him<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.350> they<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.740> nudge<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.130> him

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to him if they do get a nudge on him

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
to him if they do get a nudge on him
he's<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:33.090> easily<00:01:33.299> dispossessed<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.020> will

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
he's very easily dispossessed and will

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
he's very easily dispossessed and will
lose<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> ball<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> fairly<00:01:35.610> easily<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
lose the ball and fairly easily which is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
lose the ball and fairly easily which is
a<00:01:36.210> bit<00:01:36.390> annoying<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.500> he's<00:01:37.680> not

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
a bit annoying it really is he's not

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
a bit annoying it really is he's not
exactly<00:01:38.280> Mike<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.909> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.509> cam<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> don't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
exactly Mike and kind of cam I don't

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
exactly Mike and kind of cam I don't
normally<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.439> extremely<00:01:41.250> weak<00:01:41.490> comes<00:01:41.759> but

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
normally like extremely weak comes but

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
normally like extremely weak comes but
then<00:01:42.479> he's<00:01:42.720> driven<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.140> decent<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.890> did

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
then he's driven was decent and it did

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
then he's driven was decent and it did
make<00:01:44.220> him<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.640> playable<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> didn't<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
make him and playable if you didn't have

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.270 
make him and playable if you didn't have
that<00:01:45.869> dribbling<00:01:46.229> he<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.799> an<00:01:46.890> absolute

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
that dribbling he would be an absolute

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.679 
that dribbling he would be an absolute
nightmare<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.850> play<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.570> really

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
nightmare to play with you really really

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.030 
nightmare to play with you really really
would<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.770> i'm<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
would so I was one thing i'm going to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
would so I was one thing i'm going to
advise<00:01:50.280> straight<00:01:50.520> away<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.210> can't<00:01:51.420> handle

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
advise straight away if you can't handle

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
advise straight away if you can't handle
weak<00:01:51.930> players<00:01:52.200> don't<00:01:52.770> try<00:01:53.009> Coutinho<00:01:53.490> because

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
weak players don't try Coutinho because

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370 
weak players don't try Coutinho because
he'll<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.210> frustrating<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.320> if

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
he'll be very frustrating for you but if

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.510 
he'll be very frustrating for you but if
you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.649> handle<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.100> you're<00:01:56.219> good<00:01:56.369> with

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you can handle it and you're good with

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.069 
you can handle it and you're good with
dribbling<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.509> you'll<00:01:57.600> enjoy<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
dribbling then I think you'll enjoy a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
dribbling then I think you'll enjoy a
lot<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.520> said<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.909> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
lot more and as I said I'm going to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
lot more and as I said I'm going to
include<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> chances<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> he<00:02:01.350> did<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
include some the chances that he did so

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
include some the chances that he did so
hope<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.100> didn't<00:02:02.340> score<00:02:02.520> off<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:02.909> he

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
hope that we didn't score off because he

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.260 
hope that we didn't score off because he
did<00:02:03.299> set<00:02:03.780> quite<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.259> few<00:02:04.500> chances<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.549> my

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
did set quite a few chances that then my

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.700 
did set quite a few chances that then my
striker<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.840> didn't<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.140> away<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.500> much

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
striker just didn't put away pretty much

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.889 
striker just didn't put away pretty much
and<00:02:07.890> another<00:02:08.670> thing<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.030> had<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> include<00:02:09.539> some

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and another thing I had to include some

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.619 
and another thing I had to include some
of<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.020> penalties<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.860> he<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:12.209> gives

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
of these penalties because he like gives

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.830 
of these penalties because he like gives
me<00:02:12.780> lots<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.500> penalty

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
me lots of penalty

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.240 
me lots of penalty
because<00:02:14.080> he<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.470> gets<00:02:14.620> knocked<00:02:14.800> about<00:02:14.980> so

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
because he just gets knocked about so

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.940 
because he just gets knocked about so
easily<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.879> he<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.019> gets<00:02:17.319> panelist<00:02:17.769> first

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
easily and he just gets panelist first

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
easily and he just gets panelist first
yeah<00:02:18.489> that's<00:02:19.030> her<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.330> suppose<00:02:19.599> that's<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.840> nice

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
yeah that's her I suppose that's a nice

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.180 
yeah that's her I suppose that's a nice
positive<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:20.680> he<00:02:20.739> can<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:20.920> me<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> few

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
positive that he can get me a few

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.860 
positive that he can get me a few
penalties<00:02:21.430> would<00:02:21.970> prefer<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.330> be<00:02:22.510> scoring

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
penalties would prefer to be scoring

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.720 
penalties would prefer to be scoring
long<00:02:23.019> shots<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:23.680> I'll<00:02:24.220> take<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.489> penalty

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
long shots but then I'll take a penalty

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.440 
long shots but then I'll take a penalty
are<00:02:24.970> two<00:02:25.500> three<00:02:26.500> balls<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.790> said<00:02:27.849> pretty

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
are two three balls and as I said pretty

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.000 
are two three balls and as I said pretty
good<00:02:28.660> pretty<00:02:28.840> accurately<00:02:29.349> just<00:02:29.590> tend<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.800> over

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
good pretty accurately just tend to over

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.830 
good pretty accurately just tend to over

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
about he's not my kind of play which is

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.770 
about he's not my kind of play which is
one<00:02:42.459> reason<00:02:42.489> why<00:02:42.819> I<00:02:42.940> didn't<00:02:43.150> em<00:02:43.209> join<00:02:43.390> too<00:02:43.599> much

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
one reason why I didn't em join too much

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.180

as I say if you do like to dribble with

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.770 
as I say if you do like to dribble with
your<00:02:45.340> place<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.000> handle<00:02:46.450> them<00:02:46.599> being

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
your place and you can handle them being

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.900 
your place and you can handle them being
weak<00:02:46.930> you'll<00:02:47.319> probably<00:02:47.620> enjoy<00:02:47.860> cutanea<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.579> bit

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
weak you'll probably enjoy cutanea a bit

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.069 
weak you'll probably enjoy cutanea a bit
more<00:02:49.090> than<00:02:49.239> me<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:49.569> he<00:02:49.630> has<00:02:49.660> got<00:02:49.900> some

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
more than me but he has got some

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.870 
more than me but he has got some
absolutely<00:02:50.410> insane<00:02:51.010> dribbling<00:02:51.489> game<00:02:51.670> and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
absolutely insane dribbling game and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.330 
absolutely insane dribbling game and
that<00:02:52.299> did<00:02:52.510> make<00:02:52.690> him<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.019> very<00:02:53.079> much<00:02:53.950> playable

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
that did make him a very much playable

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.650

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
for me but they're the main positive

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
pretty good but Emmy is pretty weak and

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.640 
pretty good but Emmy is pretty weak and
does<00:03:12.670> get<00:03:12.819> shoved<00:03:13.030> about<00:03:13.239> quite<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> bit<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:13.930> to

does get shoved about quite a bit and to
be<00:03:14.739> honest<00:03:14.980> overall<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.489> reason<00:03:15.700> he<00:03:15.790> didn't

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
be honest overall the reason he didn't

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.910 
be honest overall the reason he didn't
get<00:03:16.030> like<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.840> reason<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.200> rating<00:03:17.739> seems

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
get like the reason the rating seems

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.259 
get like the reason the rating seems
quite<00:03:18.069> harshly<00:03:18.340> because<00:03:18.489> he's<00:03:18.760> not<00:03:18.940> my<00:03:19.060> kind

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
quite harshly because he's not my kind

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.400 
quite harshly because he's not my kind
of<00:03:19.359> player<00:03:19.510> didn't<00:03:19.750> really<00:03:19.900> fit<00:03:20.049> my<00:03:20.170> play
