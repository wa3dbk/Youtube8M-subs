00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Greetings to you Guild Wars 2 players and welcome to this snowy Jumping Puzzle. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 It is at the crossing point of the Bourbier de la Melancolie, in the Strait of the icy gorges, that everything begins. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 To begin, leave Kodan Camp and head to the lake to the west. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Once in the water, you should easily find the fault that leads to the entrance of the course. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Some trolls inhabit these caves but can easily be dodged if you jump quickly on the walls. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 However, if you go into combat, go for an annihilation to return to optimal speed. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 In some places, stalactites of ice can fall and slow you down. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 But they will not worry you if you keep your pace. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Watch out for blue limons that can also inflict the Frost condition. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Once is not customary, the chest is guarded by two veteran enemies: a slime and a troll. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Your opponents defeated, you just have to climb to the top of this tower. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
