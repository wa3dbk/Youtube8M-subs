designing<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.299> them<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:31.319> did<00:02:31.829> features<00:02:32.400> on

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
designing of them so we did features on

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.740 
designing of them so we did features on
it<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.849> we<00:02:32.940> thought<00:02:33.120> were<00:02:33.239> better<00:02:33.389> than<00:02:33.599> what

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
it that we thought were better than what

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.930 
it that we thought were better than what
was<00:02:33.840> existing<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> market<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.549> tried<00:02:35.849> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
was existing on the market we tried to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.410 
was existing on the market we tried to
improve<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.420> from<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.319> know<00:02:37.440> tip<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:37.980> toe<00:02:38.420> with

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
improve it from you know tip to toe with

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.870 
improve it from you know tip to toe with
everything<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.170> knew<00:02:41.160> could<00:02:41.700> be

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
everything that we knew could be

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.050 
everything that we knew could be
improved<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.530> believe<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:44.669> achieved

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
improved and so I believe we achieved

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.199 
improved and so I believe we achieved
that<00:02:45.329> because<00:02:45.930> these<00:02:46.079> guns<00:02:46.410> are<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:47.730> call<00:02:48.120> them

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
that because these guns are I call them

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.659
