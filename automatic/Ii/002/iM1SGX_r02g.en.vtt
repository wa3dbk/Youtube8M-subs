00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
of the WTA his greatest assets I mean

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
of the WTA his greatest assets I mean
obviously<00:01:14.420> Serena<00:01:15.420> Williams<00:01:15.659> was<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.780> number

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
obviously Serena Williams was the number

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.539 
obviously Serena Williams was the number
one<00:01:16.080> player<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> world<00:01:16.650> she's<00:01:16.950> she's<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
one player in the world she's she's the

comments if they go unchecked then it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.290 
comments if they go unchecked then it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
really doesn't protect the players and I

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.869 
really doesn't protect the players and I
think<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.620> year<00:02:24.129> we've<00:02:24.670> got

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
think that I think this year we've got

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.059 
think that I think this year we've got
heightened<00:02:25.269> sensitivity<00:02:25.540> across<00:02:26.170> all<00:02:26.470> kinds

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
heightened sensitivity across all kinds

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.430 
heightened sensitivity across all kinds
of<00:02:27.400> different<00:02:27.790> layers<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.569> sports<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.290> it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
of different layers and sports and it's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.110 
of different layers and sports and it's
very<00:02:29.650> interesting<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.280> Stacy<00:02:30.700> Alistar

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
very interesting to see Stacy Alistar

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
very interesting to see Stacy Alistar
really<00:02:31.450> take<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:31.989> spin<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.349> I<00:02:32.379> think<00:02:32.560> they're

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
really take a spin and I think they're

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.990 
really take a spin and I think they're
tired<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.190> too<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.340> think<00:02:33.459> that's<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.879> other

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
tired of it too I think that's the other

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.059 
tired of it too I think that's the other
thing<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.200> whole<00:02:35.349> playing<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:36.040> a

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
thing is that the whole playing like a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.770 
thing is that the whole playing like a
man<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.610> hitting<00:02:36.819> like<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> man<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.510> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
man and hitting like a man and and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.449 
man and hitting like a man and and
you're<00:02:38.379> really<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.950> really<00:02:39.160> derogatory

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you're really it's a really derogatory

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.490 
you're really it's a really derogatory
thing<00:02:40.030> especially<00:02:40.330> against<00:02:40.900> Serena<00:02:41.230> and

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
thing especially against Serena and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.490 
thing especially against Serena and
Venus<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.629> their<00:02:43.840> power<00:02:44.110> as

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
Venus because of you know their power as

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
Venus because of you know their power as
players<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.160> also<00:02:45.340> because<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:46.540> were<00:02:46.569> kind

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
players but also because they were kind

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.330 
players but also because they were kind
of<00:02:46.840> blindsided<00:02:47.319> by<00:02:47.500> this<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.799> like<00:02:47.890> they're

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
of blindsided by this it's like they're

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.800 
of blindsided by this it's like they're
at<00:02:48.489> home<00:02:48.610> minding<00:02:48.910> their<00:02:49.090> own<00:02:49.120> business<00:02:49.329> and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
at home minding their own business and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.780 
at home minding their own business and
and<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.349> was<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.650> cheap<00:02:50.829> shot<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.579> think

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
and it was just a cheap shot and I think

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.860 
and it was just a cheap shot and I think
it<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:52.030> showed<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> cheap<00:02:52.690> shot

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
it just showed that the cheap shot

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.690 
it just showed that the cheap shot
wasn't<00:02:53.079> gonna<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.319> tolerated<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.489> certainly

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
wasn't gonna be tolerated it certainly

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.490 
wasn't gonna be tolerated it certainly
wasn't<00:02:55.000> cheap<00:02:55.329> shot<00:02:55.569> are<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.840> surprised<00:02:56.349> that

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
wasn't cheap shot are you surprised that

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.920 
wasn't cheap shot are you surprised that
someone<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.099> Tarpon<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.579> stature<00:02:58.000> would<00:02:58.750> make

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
someone of Tarpon of stature would make

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.140 
someone of Tarpon of stature would make
comments<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.620> well<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.730> once<00:03:00.879> again<00:03:01.030> I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
comments like this well and once again I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.610 
comments like this well and once again I
think<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.569> might<00:03:01.750> be<00:03:01.780> one<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.470> reasons

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
think that might be one of the reasons

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.729 
think that might be one of the reasons
why<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.390> punishment<00:03:04.390> was<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.720> harsh<00:03:05.019> as<00:03:05.349> a

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
why the punishment was so harsh as a

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.369 
why the punishment was so harsh as a
reminder<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.519> hey<00:03:06.790> what<00:03:07.299> are<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.480> doing<00:03:07.870> and

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
reminder that hey what are you doing and

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.509 
reminder that hey what are you doing and
and<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.489> not<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:09.940> if<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.420> WTA

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
obviously it's in terrific standing but

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.860
