based on Thursdays those but actually

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.570 
based on Thursdays those but actually
looks<00:00:44.260> better<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.769> flesh<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.400> might

looks better in the flesh and you might

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.369 
looks better in the flesh and you might
think<00:00:45.610> somewhere<00:00:46.360> amongst<00:00:46.809> all<00:00:46.930> these<00:00:47.050> people

think somewhere amongst all these people
behind<00:00:47.500> me<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.190> new<00:00:48.910> Mercedes<00:00:49.480> GLA

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
behind me is the new Mercedes GLA

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.920 
behind me is the new Mercedes GLA
concept<00:00:51.089> as<00:00:52.089> we<00:00:52.269> have<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.449> concert<00:00:52.629> name

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
concept as we have the concert name

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.500 
concept as we have the concert name
again<00:00:53.199> shall<00:00:53.440> we<00:00:53.470> that's<00:00:54.430> if<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:55.090> fight<00:00:55.329> our

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
again shall we that's if we fight our

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.030 
again shall we that's if we fight our
way<00:00:55.629> through

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.360 

so<00:01:00.040> the<00:01:00.190> concept<00:01:00.880> GLA<00:01:01.920> based<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.220> a-class

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
so the concept GLA based on the a-class

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.040 
so the concept GLA based on the a-class
so<00:01:03.850> it's<00:01:04.000> more<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.269> an<00:01:04.660> evoke<00:01:05.250> III<00:01:06.250> driver

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
so it's more of an evoke III driver

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.990 
so it's more of an evoke III driver
Syria<00:01:08.050> is<00:01:08.130> cast<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.310> high<00:01:09.460> class<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.320> reckon

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
Syria is cast a high class but I reckon

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.230 
Syria is cast a high class but I reckon
this<00:01:13.000> looked<00:01:13.240> rather<00:01:13.450> much<00:01:13.720> better

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
this looked rather much better

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
this looked rather much better

the BMW x4 slightly different apartments

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
if your argue this would probably be a
