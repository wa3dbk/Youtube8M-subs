classic car that costs around 1.4
million<00:00:59.250> dollars<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> only

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
million dollars so that's the only

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599 
million dollars so that's the only
downside<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.590> cost<00:01:01.739> 1.4<00:01:02.399> million

dollars<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> fastest<00:01:04.589> car<00:01:04.799> for

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
dollars but this is the fastest car for

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.679 
dollars but this is the fastest car for
drag<00:01:05.220> racing<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.909> pretty<00:01:06.060> sure<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
drag racing so I'm pretty sure it is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.090 
drag racing so I'm pretty sure it is
worth<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> pick<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.860> car

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
worth it so when you pick up this car

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.560 
worth it so when you pick up this car
from<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> Auto<00:01:08.520> Show<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.939> doesn't<00:01:09.240> look<00:01:09.360> too

on<00:01:28.950> x-class<00:01:29.520> 999<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.900> same<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.650> if

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
on x-class 999 is about the same so if

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.840 
on x-class 999 is about the same so if
you<00:01:31.799> look<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> stats<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> these

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you look at the stats on all these

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.130 
you look at the stats on all these
different<00:01:33.000> Tunes<00:01:33.390> they're<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.020> much

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
different Tunes they're all pretty much

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.260 
different Tunes they're all pretty much
the<00:01:34.259> same<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.430> almost<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.180> same

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the same they have almost the same

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
the same they have almost the same
amount<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.750> horsepower<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> torque<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> all

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
amount of horsepower and torque and all

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
amount of horsepower and torque and all
that<00:01:37.950> stuff<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.850> pick<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that stuff so just pick one that you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230 
that stuff so just pick one that you
like<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> set<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.100> car<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:42.119> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
like and set it up on your car some of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.389 
like and set it up on your car some of
them<00:01:42.360> might<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> tad<00:01:43.170> bit<00:01:43.409> faster<00:01:44.159> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
them might be just a tad bit faster so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.499 
them might be just a tad bit faster so
if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
if you really want to get on the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
if you really want to get on the
leaderboards<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.439> high<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.790> make

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
leaderboards really high then just make

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639 
leaderboards really high then just make
your<00:01:48.149> own<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> inspect<00:01:49.290> these

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
your own or you can just inspect these

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
your own or you can just inspect these
really<00:01:50.009> closely<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:51.000> which<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
really closely and see which one is the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
really closely and see which one is the
fastest<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> said<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.220> chose<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
fastest but like I said I just chose a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.350 
fastest but like I said I just chose a
random<00:01:53.790> one<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.540> hit<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.460> 271<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.939> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
random one and I hit I think 271 and I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050 
random one and I hit I think 271 and I
was<00:01:57.540> number<00:01:57.990> 22<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> world<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.939> was

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
was number 22 in the world so that was

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
was number 22 in the world so that was
fast<00:02:00.299> enough<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.689> me<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.350> said<00:02:01.530> if

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
fast enough for me but like I said if

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.020 
fast enough for me but like I said if
you<00:02:01.740> guys<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.979> want<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> make<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.430> own<00:02:02.579> feel

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you guys just want to make your own feel

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789 
you guys just want to make your own feel
free<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.079> once<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.290> buy<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.409> car<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
free to do so so once you buy the car in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.109 
free to do so so once you buy the car in
the<00:02:04.890> tune<00:02:05.070> you're<00:02:05.280> done<00:02:05.460> making<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.880> beast

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the tune you're done making this beast

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.510 
the tune you're done making this beast
of<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.329> car<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.750> from<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
of a car and from here you can go and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.369 
of a car and from here you can go and
enter<00:02:08.940> drag<00:02:09.179> races<00:02:09.599> or<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.899> take<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.140> over<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
enter drag races or just take it over to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199 
enter drag races or just take it over to
the<00:02:10.560> air<00:02:10.679> strip<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> fun<00:02:11.790> time<00:02:12.030> with

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
the air strip and have a fun time with

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.610 
the air strip and have a fun time with
it<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.750> car<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.020> actually

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it now this car is actually

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
it now this car is actually
extremely<00:02:14.190> overpowered<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.120> wouldn't

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
extremely overpowered so I wouldn't

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.789 
extremely overpowered so I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:15.690> using<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.379> any<00:02:16.530> type<00:02:16.769> of

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
recommend using it in any type of

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.100 
recommend using it in any type of
circuit<00:02:17.459> or<00:02:17.610> sprint<00:02:18.030> race<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:19.049> you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
circuit or sprint race I don't think you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.559 
circuit or sprint race I don't think you
can<00:02:19.290> anyway<00:02:19.680> since<00:02:19.920> its<00:02:20.129> ex<00:02:20.340> class<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.269> you

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
can anyway since its ex class but if you

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.780 
can anyway since its ex class but if you
can<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.840> keep<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.739> drag<00:02:23.010> race<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.459> you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
can just keep it in a drag race and you

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
can just keep it in a drag race and you
will<00:02:23.879> see<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.239> best<00:02:24.450> performance<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.830> can

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
will see the best performance as you can

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.080 
will see the best performance as you can
see<00:02:26.159> in<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> drag<00:02:26.549> race<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.879> I'm<00:02:26.970> doing

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
see in the drag race that I'm doing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
see in the drag race that I'm doing
right<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.840> Ultima<00:02:28.230> GTR<00:02:28.709> was<00:02:28.890> getting

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
right here the Ultima GTR was getting

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.770 
right here the Ultima GTR was getting
ahead<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.519> me<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.909> just<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.659> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
ahead of me for just a little bit on the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
ahead of me for just a little bit on the
launch<00:02:30.989> but<00:02:31.290> after<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.829> just<00:02:32.040> destroyed

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
launch but after that I just destroyed

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.640 
launch but after that I just destroyed
them<00:02:32.849> in<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.090> car<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.989> as<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.349> tell<00:02:34.409> this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
them in this car so as you can tell this

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.680 
them in this car so as you can tell this
car<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:34.980> pretty<00:02:35.250> fast<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:36.090> don't<00:02:36.150> think<00:02:36.420> any

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
car is pretty fast and I don't think any

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
car is pretty fast and I don't think any
car<00:02:36.959> out<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.530> beat<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.829> in<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> drag<00:02:38.220> race

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
car out there can beat it in a drag race

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.580 
car out there can beat it in a drag race
but<00:02:39.239> yes<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.959> that's<00:02:40.079> pretty<00:02:40.319> much<00:02:40.409> it<00:02:40.560> for

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
but yes so that's pretty much it for

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.440 
but yes so that's pretty much it for
