do you can really do all kinds of neat
things<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:10.599> them<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.620> anyway<00:02:11.889> we<00:02:12.129> want<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
things with them but anyway we want to

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.129 
things with them but anyway we want to
make<00:02:12.609> sure<00:02:12.639> that<00:02:12.939> this<00:02:13.120> slip<00:02:13.419> is<00:02:13.599> not<00:02:13.810> too

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:14.139 
make sure that this slip is not too

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.080 
make sure that this slip is not too
thick<00:02:14.469> because<00:02:14.919> if<00:02:15.129> it's<00:02:15.340> too<00:02:15.609> thick<00:02:15.879> on<00:02:16.029> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
thick because if it's too thick on the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.390 
thick because if it's too thick on the
side

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
side

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.059 
side
the<00:02:16.549> piece<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.629> will<00:02:17.930> shrink<00:02:18.439> at<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.680> different

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
the piece it will shrink at a different

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.190 
the piece it will shrink at a different
rate<00:02:19.220> than<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.579> clay<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.939> the<00:02:20.030> piece<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.870> will

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
rate than the clay of the piece and will

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.130 
rate than the clay of the piece and will
seperate<00:02:21.709> either<00:02:22.430> before<00:02:23.000> firing<00:02:23.329> or<00:02:23.689> during

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
seperate either before firing or during

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.100 
seperate either before firing or during
firing<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.579> kind<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.849> want<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.150> use<00:02:26.900> it

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
firing so we just kind of want to use it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.850 
firing so we just kind of want to use it
sparingly<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.409> what<00:02:30.409> we're<00:02:30.530> going<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.680> do

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
is we're just going to dip our brush in

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.740 
is we're just going to dip our brush in
the<00:02:32.659> porcelain<00:02:32.900> slip<00:02:33.230> spin<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.890> wheel<00:02:34.069> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the porcelain slip spin the wheel and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.039 
the porcelain slip spin the wheel and
watch<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.930> go<00:02:37.359> okay<00:02:38.359> so<00:02:38.420> we<00:02:38.599> got<00:02:38.750> our<00:02:38.870> wheel

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
watch it go okay so we got our wheel

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.649 
watch it go okay so we got our wheel
going<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:40.220> put<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.000> slip<00:02:41.209> on<00:02:41.359> with<00:02:41.540> the

soften<00:04:19.100> those<00:04:19.280> lines<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.880> bit<00:04:20.060> or<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.780> could

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
soften those lines a bit or I could

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.499 
soften those lines a bit or I could
leave<00:04:21.380> them<00:04:21.590> quite<00:04:21.919> harsh<00:04:22.220> or<00:04:22.940> I<00:04:22.970> could<00:04:23.330> let<00:04:23.479> it

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
leave them quite harsh or I could let it

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.080 
leave them quite harsh or I could let it
get<00:04:23.780> leather<00:04:24.020> hard<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:24.860> kind<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.400> gently

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
get leather hard and just kind of gently

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.730 
get leather hard and just kind of gently
rub<00:04:26.449> them<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:26.870> blend<00:04:27.110> them<00:04:27.259> so<00:04:27.440> they<00:04:27.560> don't

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
rub them and blend them so they don't

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.050 
rub them and blend them so they don't
have<00:04:27.889> such<00:04:28.130> harsh<00:04:28.430> lines

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
have such harsh lines

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.390 
have such harsh lines
I<00:04:29.210> have<00:04:29.870> lots<00:04:30.199> of<00:04:30.380> different<00:04:30.530> options<00:04:31.039> here

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
I have lots of different options here

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.100 
I have lots of different options here
the<00:04:31.850> other<00:04:32.000> thing<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.360> could<00:04:32.570> do<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:33.050> could

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
the other thing I could do is I could

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.860 
the other thing I could do is I could
apply<00:04:33.470> more<00:04:34.009> paper<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:35.180> different<00:04:35.630> color

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
apply more paper and a different color

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.189 
apply more paper and a different color
of<00:04:36.110> slip<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.740> just<00:04:37.400> layer<00:04:37.669> this<00:04:37.940> design<00:04:38.389> but<00:04:39.139> I

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
of slip and just layer this design but I

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.860 
of slip and just layer this design but I
like<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.620> keep<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.949> simple<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.639> I<00:04:41.300> like<00:04:41.660> this

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
like to keep it simple and I like this

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.909 
like to keep it simple and I like this
piece<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.410> way<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.580> we'll<00:04:44.560> fire<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.590> and

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
piece the way it is so we'll fire it and

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.779 
piece the way it is so we'll fire it and
then<00:04:47.080> probably<00:04:48.080> put<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.470> coat<00:04:48.949> of<00:04:48.979> clear<00:04:49.160> glaze

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
then probably put a coat of clear glaze

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.680 
then probably put a coat of clear glaze
on<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:50.810> top<00:04:51.020> until<00:04:51.789> next<00:04:52.789> time<00:04:53.090> youtubers
