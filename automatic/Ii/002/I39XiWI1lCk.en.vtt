bit with the sort that foster melted of
Monte<00:00:47.910> Carlo<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.390> mean<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.809> much<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.110> aware<00:00:49.380> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
Monte Carlo I mean how much you aware of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
Monte Carlo I mean how much you aware of
that<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.770> those<00:00:49.860> situations<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.360> obviously

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that in those situations and obviously

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
that in those situations and obviously
not<00:00:51.899> nice<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.800> opponent<00:00:53.160> injured

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
not nice to see a your opponent injured

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.319 
not nice to see a your opponent injured
but<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.270> advantage

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
but can you use that to your advantage

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.610 
but can you use that to your advantage
you<00:00:54.750> may<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.930> putting<00:00:55.230> them<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you may be putting them around the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.889 
you may be putting them around the
course<00:00:55.829> even<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.280> yeah<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.450> that<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
course even more yeah I think that I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.450 
course even more yeah I think that I
mean<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.710> tough<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.160> me<00:00:59.309> was

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
mean the thing that was tough at me was

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.940 
mean the thing that was tough at me was
when<00:00:59.610> he<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.879> serving<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.860> know

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
when he was serving was the you know

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.509 
when he was serving was the you know
still<00:01:02.250> serving<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.390> 20<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.170> 30<00:01:04.769> kilometers<00:01:05.369> an

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
still serving to 20 to 30 kilometers an

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.750 
still serving to 20 to 30 kilometers an
hour<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> obviously<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.549> an

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
hour so obviously you don't have an

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.580 
hour so obviously you don't have an
opportunity<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.420> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> time<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> dictate

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
opportunity a lot of the time to dictate

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
opportunity a lot of the time to dictate
the<00:01:10.710> points<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> move<00:01:12.080> obviously

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the points and make a move obviously

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
the points and make a move obviously
when<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.470> serving<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.070> able<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
when I was serving I was able to do that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
when I was serving I was able to do that
more<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:16.320> used<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> drop<00:01:16.860> shot<00:01:17.070> well

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
more you know I used the drop shot well

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
more you know I used the drop shot well
he<00:01:17.610> seemed<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.299> he<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.689> moving<00:01:19.020> okay<00:01:19.140> side

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
he seemed like he was moving okay side

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
he seemed like he was moving okay side
to<00:01:19.740> side<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.400> words<00:01:20.640> he<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.150> struggling

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to side but for words he was struggling

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.219 
to side but for words he was struggling
so<00:01:21.869> tried<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> use<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> shot<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.140> I

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so tried to use that shot a bit and I

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.750 
so tried to use that shot a bit and I
felt<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.590> did<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> good<00:01:26.010> job<00:01:26.070> dictating<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
felt like I did a good job dictating the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.420 
felt like I did a good job dictating the
points<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.659> own<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.159> when<00:01:29.159> he<00:01:29.310> was

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
points on on my own so when he was

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
points on on my own so when he was
serving<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> different<00:01:30.330> story<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.659> was

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
serving that's a different story I was

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
serving that's a different story I was
just<00:01:30.990> trying<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.920> many<00:01:32.280> balls<00:01:32.580> back<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
just trying to get many balls back and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
just trying to get many balls back and
play<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> opportunity<00:01:34.890> was

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
play and then when the opportunity was

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.429 
play and then when the opportunity was
there<00:01:35.040> i<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.580> be<00:01:35.850> aggressive<00:01:36.330> but<00:01:36.509> easier

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there i would be aggressive but easier

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
there i would be aggressive but easier
said<00:01:37.680> than<00:01:37.830> done<00:01:38.070> when<00:01:38.610> someone<00:01:39.270> serving<00:01:39.509> that
