00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.850 
it's a perfect introduction into where
we're<00:00:05.609> at<00:00:05.640> right<00:00:06.060> now<00:00:06.200> as<00:00:07.910> as<00:00:09.559> sort<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.620> young

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
we're at right now as as sort of young

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.669 
we're at right now as as sort of young
adults<00:00:11.599> because<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.690> got<00:00:12.870> into<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.380> kids

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
adults because we got into it as kids

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.240 
adults because we got into it as kids
and<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.700> um<00:00:15.740> everything<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.859> learned<00:00:17.100> about

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
and then um everything we learned about

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.340 
and then um everything we learned about
music<00:00:17.880> whether<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.420> production<00:00:19.199> or

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
music whether it be production or

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.560 
music whether it be production or
writing<00:00:19.680> songs<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.820> always<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.210> constant

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
writing songs it was always a constant

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.310 
writing songs it was always a constant
growing<00:00:22.109> experience<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.949> finally<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> think

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
growing experience and finally I think

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
growing experience and finally I think
we're<00:00:25.320> able<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.680> stop<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> little<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:27.090> know

artists<00:01:22.770> maybe<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> level<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
artists maybe on a level that if you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
artists maybe on a level that if you
were<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.560> thoroughbred<00:01:26.130> dance<00:01:26.700> producer

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
