00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello in the summer hello caries hello 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello friends it's not bad we talked 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 car and cars digital necessarily 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 it begins with the mirror 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
 rearview mirror turns off it's old school 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.510
 it's a little old fashioned because 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.920
 since there have been back -up radars and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.060
 there are also the reversing cameras 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.439
 problem of reversing camera which 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 to keep his dashboard for 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.590
 know what's going on behind you so 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 Japanese invented this system 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 fabulous that makes the rear seats of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.050
 his car completely transparent 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 how does it work we look and we 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.989
 can not we do better these 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 maneuvers because we have a real 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.870
 large area since it is the whole 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.640
 back range that is completely 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 traces and transparent with two small 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 cameras that are at the back of the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 car that projects everything that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.780
 goes to the back of the car on a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.039
 window inclined at 45 degrees which makes 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.390
 we can see what is going on behind 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.770
 ie if the passenger sees them 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 still and overprinting 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.280
 passengers superimposed seats 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 we see what is happening behind the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.800
 car much more convenient for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.899
 do the maneuvers is so pretty 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.399
 fabulous like that it's easy the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 niche the car of the future 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.300
 she will be connected to the internet will not have it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 his app yes then that it already exists 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 on some high-end cars 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.740
 today applications power 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.549
 control his car from a distance but this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.840
 which is interesting is that it's okay 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.590
 arrive on any car and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.180
 this little box 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.280
 this little box that can be plugged into 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 the laprise diagnosis exists of everything 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.689
 is especially vehicles since 1995 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.130
 this housing to a tilt sensor of 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.630
 speed and others why do by 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.909
 example when we know that in his car 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.520
 and taken away 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.140
 not because it can be prevented 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.850
 cantal is sent to the pound 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.229
 as for them also to mess up there a gps 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 she knows the speed of the car and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 also knows the fuel the alcohol the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.140
 fuel and could send like this a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.939
 alert for example if a parent to 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 program the beautiful device tell the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.990
 parents the child has passed the area that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 was designated eva and exceed 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 speed limits is also useful 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.399
 for insurance as insurance 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.939
 it can know how you use 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.829
 your vehicle 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.750
 and then give you the bonus or penalty 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.909
 if you exceed the speed and a stamp 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 chance among our car he 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.969
 drive alone now so that's it 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 There are breaks in pipes under the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.630
 only name wanted a preorder and me 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.820
 I always comment and that's the car 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.560
 race alone this is it exists 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 it works it works extremely well 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.849
 the technology is perfectly perfected 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.349
 today we even see circuit in 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.580
 the street in the caps today 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.330
 she sees the fires she moves in 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.410
 traffic no problem 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.540
 the only concern we have today with 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.970
 autonomous cars this is the legislation 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.650
 states do not want to allow 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.420
 autonomous cars and there is also a 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.530
 insurance problem is what the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.760
 insurers if there had been an accident 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.720
 who will pay what is the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.250
 car builder is what 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.300
 it's you it's a bit of a concern 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.740
 today then we wonder if 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.480
 a market because we do not know if the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.800
 users would you me be ready to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.820
 get in a car like this 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.500
 but it can be convenient for 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.120
 taxis for example a taxi that would be 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.580
 as much but no they give the address and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.810
 no yes or if you could car 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.400
 autonomous you want to park well 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.720
 rather than looking for a place the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.110
 car bar go around the neighborhood 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.070
 all alone and ask you it's nice the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 street other interesting discoveries 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.400
 the font of the table of 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.690
 edge may possibly cause source 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.770
 of accidents the fonts 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.690
 it's the cast you know when 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.070
 helvetica and aria the others he goes from 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.990
 researchers from and my teeth probes have 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.430
 tested several types of cast iron 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.930
 several types of font 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.430
 and realized that some 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.750
 fonts and well ask you more 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.640
 of attention and this case can be 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.190
 dangerous especially on the road and getting 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.350
 find that humanist type fonts 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.640
 the century alu if you have a font 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.050
 which is called belted for example and 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.640
 well pose less problems if they 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.610
 are easier to read faster at 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.320
 to say that grotesque type fonts 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.690
 especially at the grotesque square that she 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.100
 by 10% more requests good tool 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.120
 percent of the most attention and where 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.590
 it's very important it's when you are 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.050
 on the highway and well it can do 80 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.090
 difference meters on the road and 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.650
 it's essential in italics it's good 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.650
 it's no it's with mercialys
