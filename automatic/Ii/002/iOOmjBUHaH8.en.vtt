00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
guys learn from you know I think we

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.780 
guys learn from you know I think we
didn't<00:03:18.010> play<00:03:18.129> very<00:03:18.159> well<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.489> game<00:03:18.610> we<00:03:18.760> all

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
didn't play very well that game we all

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.850 
didn't play very well that game we all
know<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.269> we<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.260> didn't<00:03:20.440> play<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.769> best

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.710 
know that we we didn't play to the best
of<00:03:21.010> our<00:03:21.099> abilities<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:22.360> think<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.690> just

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
of our abilities and I think that just

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.660 
of our abilities and I think that just
kind<00:03:23.080> of<00:03:23.110> started<00:03:23.379> a<00:03:23.409> little<00:03:23.530> fire<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.830> all<00:03:24.489> of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
kind of started a little fire in all of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.559 
kind of started a little fire in all of
us<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.909> know<00:03:24.940> it's<00:03:25.209> one<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.390> those<00:03:25.450> things

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
us you know it's one of those things

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.330 
us you know it's one of those things
where<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.290> can't<00:03:26.530> change<00:03:26.709> what<00:03:26.980> happened<00:03:27.010> but

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
where you can't change what happened but

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.479 
where you can't change what happened but
all<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.180> learn<00:03:28.360> from<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.659> and<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.010> that

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
all you learn from it and you know that

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.580 
all you learn from it and you know that
that<00:03:30.970> loss<00:03:31.180> kind<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.510> started<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.810> fire<00:03:31.989> us<00:03:32.260> we

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
that loss kind of started to fire us we

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.559 
that loss kind of started to fire us we
know<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.129> we<00:03:33.970> should<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.239> played<00:03:34.390> better

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
know that we should have played better

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.589 
know that we should have played better
and<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.470> think<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:35.920> ought<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.610> take<00:03:37.420> each

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
and I think we ought to to take each

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.630 
and I think we ought to to take each
game<00:03:37.629> each<00:03:38.200> game<00:03:38.530> this<00:03:38.680> year<00:03:38.739> with<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.099> little

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
game each game this year with a little

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.699 
game each game this year with a little
fire<00:03:39.909> in<00:03:39.940> us<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.659> not<00:03:41.409> let<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.560> happen

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
fire in us and and not let that happen

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.880 
fire in us and and not let that happen
