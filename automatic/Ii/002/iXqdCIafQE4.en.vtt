00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.349
 hello very good this time 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.689
 I want to teach how to tune the tdt 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.789
 without windows media center obviously 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.800
 you need a physical tuner a 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.680
 let's go and a program the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.870
 program itself is vlc the link is in the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.990
 description we install it but not what 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.320
 open we open the browser 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.080
 and the second link of the description by 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.720
 course the description we paste it and what 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.790
 we copy and open capacity as you see 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.290
 we get all our own all 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.850
 the provinces of Spain maybe we have 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.240
 to select where we say I am 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.240
 Andalusian 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.370
 ok here are all the programs 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.900
 grouped in frequency as you see are 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.770
 all of us are missing and one I will not open 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:12.640
 no software copyright but good 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.979
 I'll open these are local and copy of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
 this number 5 the number that 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.630
 here next to the frequency if 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.500
 I would like to open 3 hd antenna would this 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.659
 but good we copied this shtick and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.149
 now if we open the vlc media player 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.719
 we're going to half open devices 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.390
 capture and here we select digital tv 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.880
 very important if not we are not 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.209
 We reserve to reproduce to nothing was 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.400
 digital dvb t and this is where we have the 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:47.740
 copy the frequency 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.740
 we copy and we play 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.170
 and as you can see we already have the tdt 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.380
 and we have the theory here 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.750
 then here between almerÃ­a of love 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 well 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.100
 we go as if we had half time is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.540
 a little more bear because you have to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.170
 be with the frescoes up or for 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.470
 down but good 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.470
 a fix makes us go 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.050
 and well this has been everything I hope to have you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.630
 been helpful and if you liked the video 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.780
 like and nothing until the next 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.780
 bye
