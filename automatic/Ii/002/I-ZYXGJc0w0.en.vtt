00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.780
 after 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.130
 good for those who always 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.340
 they ask me to send messages out there 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.700
 in the youtube or in the facebook that yes 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.300
 that by God I recommend you to 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.670
 start and always always always 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.880
 I recommend joel with the panter because 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:30.270
 he owns them is very economical is very 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.790
 soft very light buttons are 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.980
 I facilitate soft what is the bellows 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.260
 It also opens and closes very 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.260
 you can easily make the bellows or 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.010
 compared to other resources that are more 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.230
 or less in the same price range 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.720
 they are really hard the buttons are 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.300
 very raised very hard what is the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.430
 fire is also fought a lot for 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.290
 open and close and clear because if they want 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.180
 make strength as fatty because it is super 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.460
 perfect true but what one wants 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.220
 when it's playing then it's that 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.020
 what the mind go here in the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.050
 fingers but be worrying that there 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.420
 that the air ran out that no no 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.190
 then another thing that I noticed the excess 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.460
 of bellows or with each other accordion 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.270
 that is to say no more no or more is done 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.380
 but more and you can not but you can not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.210
 I say it is very good I recommend it 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.829
 is more in my opinion and something else then 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 It is very important because you have the 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.570
 backing of what is the hummer brand 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.210
 that has been little 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:42.920
 you know then 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.100
 for those who want to start 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.390
 I recommend it to you and set aside 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.119
 it also serves as it can be played 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.520
 for the cheek and for everyone it's very 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.520
 good the truth and well anyone not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109
 to drink 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 Y 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.240
 m 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.990
 once 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.390
 it is more or less like a sample 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.340
 of how the border function sounds 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.350
 or border also as they say what 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.770

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.480

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.120
 accordion for those who want 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.980
 learn even if they want to play 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.520

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.210
