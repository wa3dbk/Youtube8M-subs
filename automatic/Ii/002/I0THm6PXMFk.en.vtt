route that B is on you want a motion him

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.310 
route that B is on you want a motion him
inside<00:00:59.380> about<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.190> step<00:01:00.489> ahead<00:01:00.610> 42<00:01:01.420> steps<00:01:01.719> he

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
inside about a step ahead 42 steps he

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.829 
inside about a step ahead 42 steps he
always<00:01:02.590> gives<00:01:02.890> inside<00:01:03.430> position<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.509> cannot

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
always gives inside position and cannot

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.460 
always gives inside position and cannot
get<00:01:05.020> bumped<00:01:05.470> as<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:06.130> see<00:01:06.369> he<00:01:06.729> cuts<00:01:07.119> in<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
get bumped as you see he cuts in and the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.180 
get bumped as you see he cuts in and the
safety<00:01:08.770> cannot<00:01:09.399> react<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> ball<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:11.190> his

safety cannot react to the ball and his

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.249 
safety cannot react to the ball and his
defender<00:01:12.700> cannot<00:01:13.180> react<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.780> ball<00:01:13.990> either

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
defender cannot react to the ball either

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.950 
defender cannot react to the ball either
so<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.550> was<00:01:15.700> versa<00:01:15.880> two<00:01:16.150> min<00:01:16.360> under<00:01:16.540> both

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
so that was versa two min under both

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.350 
so that was versa two min under both
safeties<00:01:17.440> are<00:01:17.560> too<00:01:17.740> slow<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.250> react<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:18.790> that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
safeties are too slow to react and that

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.810 
safeties are too slow to react and that
is<00:01:19.479> an<00:01:19.600> easy<00:01:19.869> touchdown<00:01:20.350> as<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.430> saw<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.790> right

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
is an easy touchdown as you saw it right

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.450 
is an easy touchdown as you saw it right
there<00:01:21.970> then<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.900> still<00:01:23.170> have<00:01:23.200> all<00:01:23.650> be<00:01:23.979> on<00:01:24.280> his

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
there then you still have all be on his

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.420 
there then you still have all be on his
route<00:01:24.970> that's<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.659> nice<00:01:25.869> look<00:01:26.200> maybe<00:01:26.590> five<00:01:27.070> to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
route that's a nice look maybe five to

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.300 
route that's a nice look maybe five to
ten<00:01:27.700> yards<00:01:28.180> on<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.990> right<00:01:29.290> side<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:30.040> whip

ten yards on the right side that whip

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.490 
ten yards on the right side that whip
route<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.820> that's<00:01:31.570> basically<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.020> against

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
route and that's basically it against

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.370 
route and that's basically it against
man<00:01:32.710> coverage<00:01:32.979> display<00:01:33.760> um<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.510> drought<00:01:35.110> does

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
call that route but it destroys zone

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.690 
call that route but it destroys zone
also<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:08.290> want<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.009> throw<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.340> around<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
also and you want to throw it around the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.509 
also and you want to throw it around the
same<00:02:09.970> timing<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.989> is<00:02:11.200> red<00:02:11.860> zone<00:02:12.160> you

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
same timing but that is red zone you

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.580 
same timing but that is red zone you
want<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> throw<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:12.940> after<00:02:13.510> he<00:02:13.660> cuts<00:02:13.959> not<00:02:14.320> right

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
want to throw it after he cuts not right

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.949 
want to throw it after he cuts not right
before<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.549> want<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.820> wait<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.180> me<00:02:16.299> clears<00:02:16.660> the

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
before you want to wait to me clears the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.560 
before you want to wait to me clears the
second<00:02:17.620> level<00:02:17.799> hook<00:02:18.190> zone<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.450> want

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
second level hook zone and then you want

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.940 
second level hook zone and then you want
to<00:02:19.690> throw<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.049> against<00:02:20.260> his<00:02:20.410> own<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.919> that

to throw it against his own and that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.180 
to throw it against his own and that
route<00:02:21.820> demands<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:22.690> much<00:02:23.019> attention<00:02:23.769> because

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
route demands so much attention because

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.530 
route demands so much attention because
it<00:02:24.790> takes<00:02:25.060> away

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
it takes away

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.780 
it takes away
about<00:02:25.719> three<00:02:26.170> defenders<00:02:26.829> and<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.549> leaves

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
about three defenders and that leaves

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.270 
about three defenders and that leaves
AIDS<00:02:28.120> crossing<00:02:28.689> route<00:02:28.870> completely<00:02:29.500> wide<00:02:29.769> open

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
AIDS crossing route completely wide open

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.209 
AIDS crossing route completely wide open
as<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.939> see<00:02:31.180> he<00:02:31.450> has<00:02:31.599> four<00:02:31.989> defenders<00:02:32.769> on<00:02:33.159> him

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
as you see he has four defenders on him

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.949 
as you see he has four defenders on him
and<00:02:34.060> boom<00:02:34.659> easy<00:02:35.200> pass<00:02:35.980> maybe<00:02:36.430> 20<00:02:36.939> 25<00:02:37.120> yards<00:02:37.870> to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
and boom easy pass maybe 20 25 yards to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.229 
and boom easy pass maybe 20 25 yards to
a<00:02:38.109> because<00:02:38.920> they<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.129> so<00:02:39.370> worried<00:02:39.760> about<00:02:39.819> eggs

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
a because they are so worried about eggs

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.660 
a because they are so worried about eggs
on<00:02:40.510> his<00:02:40.659> route<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:41.500> why<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.739> route<00:02:42.159> is<00:02:42.370> very

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
on his route that's why I route is very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.550 
on his route that's why I route is very
very<00:02:42.909> useful<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.870> makes<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.290> play

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
very useful and really makes this play

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160 
very useful and really makes this play
as<00:02:45.129> you<00:02:45.310> saw<00:02:45.489> right<00:02:45.700> there<00:02:45.909> this<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.720> verse<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
as you saw right there this is verse a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.979 
as you saw right there this is verse a
cover<00:02:47.500> three<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.250> he's<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:49.090> wide<00:02:49.299> open<00:02:49.750> as

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
cover three and he's that wide open as

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.319 
cover three and he's that wide open as
if<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.379> is<00:02:50.409> a<00:02:50.590> cover<00:02:50.859> too<00:02:51.159> because<00:02:52.000> both

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
if it is a cover too because both

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.399 
if it is a cover too because both
safeties<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.220> left<00:02:54.430> side<00:02:54.670> are<00:02:55.170> guarding<00:02:56.170> X

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
safeties on the left side are guarding X

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.199 
safeties on the left side are guarding X
as<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.889> see<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.069> there<00:02:57.459> they're<00:02:57.939> both

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
as you see right there they're both

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.679 
as you see right there they're both
guarding<00:02:58.689> eggs<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.200> then<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.829> safety<00:03:00.310> is

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
guarding eggs and then the safety is

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.629 
guarding eggs and then the safety is
trailing<00:03:01.689> the<00:03:02.079> post<00:03:02.349> route<00:03:02.590> on<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:02.920> right<00:03:03.370> as
