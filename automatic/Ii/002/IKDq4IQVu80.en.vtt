00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hi friends from youtube I bring you a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.230
 review delineated aligner is a pencil 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:14.610
 good down this you know here I leave you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 this how I made this makeup and here 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.180
 I also leave you how I painted my nails 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.980
 well springtime hopefully and you cheer and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.439
 also see them that I had bought 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 at the time an eyeliner in a down 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 to call them man cost me quite 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.719
 cheap is quite expensive because it was the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.460
 novelty and I came out in around between 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.190
 40 or 50 Mexican pesos 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.020
 and then family says it did not work 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.120
 then this one I said good I'm going to give 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.649
 a tour of the news here in my 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.890
 city and I found two versions that to 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.890
 you can work pretty well 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.530
 this the first one I found was this one 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 love 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 and up to here you can see the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.730
 the pencil says this and the angel and this one 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.150
 I only found it in black 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.520
 and already has a very nice design are some 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.720
 little flowers and here is the down 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.430
 super finito super delgadito and gives you two 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.730
 effects gives you the pretty down effect 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.450
 pretty chubby and also gives you the plus 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.800
 of the option that you do it very very 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.820
 finito you saw bone and here is something 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.160
 pulse and practice on all this the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.400
 another version that I found that I also 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.940
 it worked quite well this is this one 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.310
 kegel this there are two presentations in a 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.369
 for eyes and another for this lips 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.799
 and I like I said to see let's go we're going to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.979
 try and the truth works for me 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.530
 well I did not buy for lips because 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.920
 As I'm telling you, I was not testing and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 this is the presentation 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.860
 it's quite chubby this the tip is very 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.290
 hard 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.769
 that is, it does not bend, it does not just give you a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.819
 a thick this is the thickness that gives you and 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.909
 with the exquisite what you can do is 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.430
 this try to do it as directly 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.020
 possible but if it's a little bit more 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.010
 work 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.909
 this textures 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.650
 the love one has already dried up definitively 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.810
 It is dry and yes a super layer 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.480
 thin or like a super down 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.829
 delgadita and that of kegel has a 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.530
 texture as sticky is this even 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.540
 It can work for you, I think it's a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.379
 first because it leaves you a texture 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.569
 quite as very sticky this arrives a 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.629
 moment when it dries it dries and the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.379
 it's really hard, you know, I hope 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.799
 and you anime and you liked the video 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:22.060
 I'm going to be using this in 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.060
 my makeups these 2 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.849
 I already told you last long enough feel a 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.530
 lots do not irritate your skin does not hurt 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:35.650
 no, it's not above all it does not look like that 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.250
 run not do not run they're great 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.080
 I hope and you cheer and 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.820
 bye 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.820
 and move around the country
