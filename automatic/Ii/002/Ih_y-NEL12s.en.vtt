okay<00:00:01.319> there<00:00:01.469> are<00:00:01.500> three<00:00:01.589> types<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.280> shock<00:00:02.760> in

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay there are three types of shock in

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.730 
okay there are three types of shock in
this<00:00:03.149> video<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.510> will<00:00:03.659> talk<00:00:03.840> about<00:00:03.990> hypovolemic

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
this video I will talk about hypovolemic

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.530 
this video I will talk about hypovolemic
and<00:00:04.950> cardiogenic<00:00:05.339> shock<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.029> next<00:00:06.299> video

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
and cardiogenic shock and the next video

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.000 
and cardiogenic shock and the next video
will<00:00:06.660> talk<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:07.109> septic<00:00:07.500> shock

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
will talk about septic shock

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.759 
will talk about septic shock
first<00:00:08.880> there<00:00:09.090> are<00:00:09.150> four<00:00:09.450> parameters<00:00:09.769> cardiac

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
first there are four parameters cardiac

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.930 
first there are four parameters cardiac
output<00:00:11.280> total<00:00:11.969> peripheral<00:00:12.389> resistance<00:00:13.940> lead

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
output total peripheral resistance lead

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.090 
output total peripheral resistance lead
ventricular<00:00:15.570> end<00:00:15.809> diastolic<00:00:16.020> pressure<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
ventricular end diastolic pressure and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 
ventricular end diastolic pressure and
finally<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.699> will<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:17.880> mixed<00:00:18.449> venous

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
finally you will have mixed venous

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.130 
finally you will have mixed venous
oxygen<00:00:19.020> content<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.090> each<00:00:21.480> parameter<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
oxygen content so for each parameter you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.630 
oxygen content so for each parameter you
have<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.560> whether<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.980> decrease<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
have to know whether it is decrease and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
have to know whether it is decrease and
increase<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> exact<00:00:24.539> mechanism<00:00:25.080> behind

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
increase and the exact mechanism behind

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.250 
increase and the exact mechanism behind
that<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.029> case<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> hypovolemic<00:00:27.840> shock<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
that in case of hypovolemic shock the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
that in case of hypovolemic shock the
cardiac<00:00:28.680> output<00:00:28.890> will<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.429> decrease<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.090> case

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
cardiac output will be decrease in case

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.450 
cardiac output will be decrease in case
of<00:00:30.480> cardiogenic<00:00:30.810> shock<00:00:31.080> also<00:00:31.679> decrease<00:00:32.099> but

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
of cardiogenic shock also decrease but

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.900 
of cardiogenic shock also decrease but
both<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.899> different<00:00:34.110> reason

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
both of them have different reason

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
both of them have different reason
so<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> colored<00:00:36.360> carpet<00:00:36.600> will<00:00:36.989> decrease<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
so the colored carpet will decrease in

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
so the colored carpet will decrease in
case<00:00:37.649> heart-opening<00:00:38.370> shock<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
case heart-opening shock because you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.030 
case heart-opening shock because you
will<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.660> decrease<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> blood<00:00:40.469> volume<00:00:40.680> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
will have decrease in a blood volume you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610 
will have decrease in a blood volume you
don't<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> blood<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> blood<00:00:43.379> volume

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
don't have a blood so the blood volume

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
don't have a blood so the blood volume
in<00:00:44.010> decrease<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.420> enough<00:00:45.750> amount

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
in decrease you don't have enough amount

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.049 
in decrease you don't have enough amount
of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> blood<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> come<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> venous

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
of the blood that come from the venous

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
of the blood that come from the venous
system<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.730> ventricles<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> atria

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
system to the ventricles to the atria

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.970 
system to the ventricles to the atria
and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> ventricles<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> result<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and the ventricles as a result of this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.889 
and the ventricles as a result of this
the<00:00:53.309> pump<00:00:53.610> activity<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> heart<00:00:54.719> will

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the pump activity of the heart will

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.830 
the pump activity of the heart will
decrease<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> preload<00:00:56.100> decrease

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
decrease because the preload decrease

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.849 
decrease because the preload decrease
how<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:58.020> cardiogenic<00:00:58.440> shock

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
how about cardiogenic shock

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
how about cardiogenic shock
why<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.670> cardiogenic<00:01:00.180> shock<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.719> have

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
why in cardiogenic shock you have

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
why in cardiogenic shock you have
decrease<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.379> calcutta<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.340> basically

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
decrease in calcutta because basically

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.359 
decrease in calcutta because basically
the<00:01:02.969> contractile<00:01:03.600> force<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.650> contractile

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the contractile force the contractile

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
the contractile force the contractile
force<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> heart<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.720> decreased

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
force of the heart will be decreased

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
force of the heart will be decreased
so<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> contractile<00:01:08.670> forces<00:01:09.090> because

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
so here the contractile forces because

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.250 
so here the contractile forces because
while<00:01:10.080> here<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.830> hypovolemic<00:01:11.400> shock<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
while here on the hypovolemic shock is a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
while here on the hypovolemic shock is a
blood<00:01:13.260> volume<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.710> decreased<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.580> keep<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
blood volume is decreased but keep in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.679 
blood volume is decreased but keep in
your<00:01:15.330> mind

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
your mind

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.510 
your mind
both<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.290> decreased<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.040> calorie

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
both of them have decreased in calorie

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
both of them have decreased in calorie
code<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> result<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.020> decrease<00:01:19.380> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
code as a result of decrease in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
code as a result of decrease in
character<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> both<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> them<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
character of that both of them will it

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
character of that both of them will it
will<00:01:21.540> increase<00:01:21.960> total<00:01:22.380> peripheral

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
will increase total peripheral

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.070 
will increase total peripheral
resistance<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> reflex<00:01:24.450> mechanism

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
resistance and this is reflex mechanism

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.990 
resistance and this is reflex mechanism
what<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> mean<00:01:26.310> by<00:01:26.490> reflex

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
what what I mean by reflex

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600 
what what I mean by reflex
I<00:01:27.090> mean<00:01:27.420> sympathetic<00:01:28.229> effect<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.100> will

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I mean sympathetic effect will be will

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.130 
I mean sympathetic effect will be will
be<00:01:29.810> stimulated<00:01:30.810> ADH<00:01:31.740> will<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.159> stimulated<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
be stimulated ADH will be stimulated and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
be stimulated ADH will be stimulated and
even<00:01:34.140> angiotensin<00:01:35.040> 2<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> stimulated<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
even angiotensin 2 will be stimulated so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.810 
even angiotensin 2 will be stimulated so
catecholamine<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.650> increased<00:01:38.159> ADH<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
catecholamine is increased ADH and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
catecholamine is increased ADH and
angiotensin<00:01:39.659> 2<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.259> usually<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
angiotensin 2 and this is usually the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.550 
angiotensin 2 and this is usually the
common<00:01:41.750> manifestation<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:42.899> patient<00:01:43.380> which

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
common manifestation any patient which

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.480 
common manifestation any patient which
is<00:01:43.590> hypotension

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
is hypotension

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
is hypotension
any<00:01:44.610> patient<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.479> hypertension<00:01:45.720> reflex<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
any patient with hypertension reflex and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.679 
any patient with hypertension reflex and
part<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> activity<00:01:47.399> will<00:01:47.549> increase<00:01:47.689> ADH

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
part of the activity will increase ADH

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.319 
part of the activity will increase ADH
angiotensin<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> increase<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.250> try<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
angiotensin to increase because try to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
angiotensin to increase because try to
unstable<00:01:51.750> eyes<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> blood<00:01:52.409> pressure<00:01:52.649> and

how<00:02:00.450> about<00:02:00.719> levantar<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.380> understand

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
how about levantar can understand

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.399 
how about levantar can understand
exposure<00:02:02.390> because<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
exposure because you do it because you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
exposure because you do it because you
have<00:02:04.439> decrease<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> blood<00:02:05.430> volume<00:02:05.640> again

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
have decrease in a blood volume again

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.350 
have decrease in a blood volume again
because<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.780> decrease<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.409> blood<00:02:07.560> volume

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
because you are decrease in blood volume

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.500 
because you are decrease in blood volume
so<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> pressure<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.760> pressure<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so the pressure the pressure in the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.929 
so the pressure the pressure in the
heart<00:02:12.660> will<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.080> also

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
heart will be also

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.240 
heart will be also
because<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.959> don't<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.349> blood<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.950> this

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
because you don't have a blood so this

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.649 
because you don't have a blood so this
is<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.459> same<00:02:16.640> reason<00:02:16.849> decreasing<00:02:17.540> blood

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
is the same reason decreasing blood

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.780 
is the same reason decreasing blood
volume<00:02:18.019> as<00:02:18.379> a<00:02:18.620> result<00:02:19.069> of<00:02:19.189> decrease<00:02:19.549> in<00:02:19.700> blood

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.000 
volume as a result of decrease in blood
volume<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.360> pressure<00:02:21.079> they<00:02:21.439> have<00:02:21.470> and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
volume the pressure they have and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.860 
volume the pressure they have and
pressure<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> heart<00:02:22.970> at<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.569> end<00:02:23.720> of

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
diastole II because the diastolic

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.380 
diastole II because the diastolic
pressure<00:02:25.549> will<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.909> decreased

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
pressure will be decreased

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.539 
pressure will be decreased

have extraction of oxygen in arterial

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.990 
have extraction of oxygen in arterial
system<00:03:42.169> so<00:03:42.500> as<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> result<00:03:42.889> of<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.400> oxygen

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
system so as a result of this oxygen

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.939 
system so as a result of this oxygen
content<00:03:44.269> here<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.349> arterial<00:03:45.829> system

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
content here and the arterial system

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.009 
content here and the arterial system
will<00:03:46.250> be<00:03:46.400> high<00:03:46.609> but<00:03:47.209> when<00:03:47.359> oxygen<00:03:47.780> content

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
will be high but when oxygen content

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.809 
will be high but when oxygen content
comes<00:03:48.470> from<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.919> the<00:03:49.010> venous<00:03:49.280> system<00:03:49.430> now<00:03:49.760> the

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
comes from to the venous system now the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.550 
comes from to the venous system now the
oxygen<00:03:50.359> will<00:03:50.510> be<00:03:50.540> low<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:51.019> result<00:03:51.440> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
oxygen will be low as a result of

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.770 
oxygen will be low as a result of
extraction<00:03:52.160> okay<00:03:52.609> this<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.299> think<00:03:53.660> it's

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
extraction okay this is I think it's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780 
extraction okay this is I think it's
easy<00:03:54.019> what's<00:03:54.919> the<00:03:55.069> problem<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.549> case<00:03:55.730> of

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
easy what's the problem in case of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.000 
easy what's the problem in case of
hypovolemic<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.690> cardiogenic<00:03:57.109> shock<00:03:57.319> let's

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock let's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.830 
hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock let's
draw<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.400> same<00:03:58.699> page<00:03:58.940> let's<00:03:59.209> draw<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.569> same

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
draw the same page let's draw the same

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.319 
draw the same page let's draw the same
diagram<00:03:59.900> again<00:04:00.609> imagine<00:04:01.609> this<00:04:01.730> is<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:01.909> artery

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
diagram again imagine this is the artery

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.849 
diagram again imagine this is the artery
and<00:04:02.569> this<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.900> venous<00:04:03.199> system<00:04:03.349> this<00:04:03.709> is

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
and this is the venous system this is

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.550 
and this is the venous system this is
micro<00:04:04.159> circulations<00:04:04.849> in<00:04:05.180> case<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:06.109> hyperbola

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
micro circulations in case of hyperbola

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.770 
micro circulations in case of hyperbola
mechanical<00:04:07.159> genic<00:04:07.579> shock<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:08.000> will<00:04:08.120> have<00:04:08.359> you

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
mechanical genic shock you will have you

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.099 
mechanical genic shock you will have you
will<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.379> more<00:04:10.370> extraction<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.359> oxygen<00:04:11.900> so

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
will have more extraction of oxygen so

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.469 
will have more extraction of oxygen so
increased<00:04:12.620> oxygen<00:04:13.129> extraction<00:04:13.609> so<00:04:14.299> as<00:04:14.449> a

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
increased oxygen extraction so as a

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.960 
increased oxygen extraction so as a
result<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:15.079> this<00:04:15.349> this<00:04:15.590> oxygen<00:04:16.070> extraction<00:04:16.609> is

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
result of this this oxygen extraction is

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.270 
result of this this oxygen extraction is
increased<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:17.750> an<00:04:17.900> increase<00:04:18.199> extraction<00:04:19.070> as<00:04:19.220> a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
increased so an increase extraction as a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.460 
increased so an increase extraction as a
result<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.090> an<00:04:20.209> increasing<00:04:20.690> instruction<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
result of an increasing instruction the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.500 
result of an increasing instruction the
oxygen<00:04:21.859> content<00:04:22.099> now<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.909> venous<00:04:23.240> system

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
oxygen content now in the venous system

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.870 
oxygen content now in the venous system
will<00:04:24.169> be<00:04:24.349> much<00:04:24.590> much<00:04:24.800> less<00:04:24.860> that's<00:04:25.610> why<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
will be much much less that's why the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.080 
will be much much less that's why the
oxygen<00:04:26.389> content<00:04:26.630> is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
oxygen content is

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.210 
oxygen content is
case<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.660> cardiogenic<00:04:28.020> also<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> case<00:04:29.070> of

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
case of cardiogenic also a case of

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.670 
case of cardiogenic also a case of
hypovolemic<00:04:29.850> why<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.449> will<00:04:30.720> have<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.560> is

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
hypovolemic why you will have this is

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.379 
hypovolemic why you will have this is
the<00:04:31.800> question<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.160> all<00:04:32.280> have<00:04:32.699> an<00:04:32.910> increase<00:04:33.240> in

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
the question we all have an increase in

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.360 
the question we all have an increase in
extraction<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:33.990> oxygen<00:04:34.470> because<00:04:35.070> both<00:04:35.340> of

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
extraction of oxygen because both of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.810 
extraction of oxygen because both of
them<00:04:35.729> water<00:04:35.940> cardiogenic<00:04:36.419> are<00:04:36.810> hypovolemic

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
them water cardiogenic are hypovolemic

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.250 
them water cardiogenic are hypovolemic
both<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:38.970> them<00:04:39.180> they<00:04:39.360> have<00:04:39.570> both<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.840> them<00:04:40.080> they

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
both of them they have both of them they

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.480 
both of them they have both of them they
have<00:04:40.440> decrease<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.850> blood<00:04:42.169> flow<00:04:43.169> so<00:04:43.530> once

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
have decrease and the blood flow so once

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.550 
have decrease and the blood flow so once
you<00:04:44.729> will<00:04:44.880> have<00:04:45.090> decrement<00:04:45.600> once<00:04:46.229> you<00:04:46.440> will

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
you will have decrement once you will

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.439 
you will have decrement once you will
have<00:04:46.770> decrement<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.550> blood<00:04:47.760> flow<00:04:48.060> you

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
have decrement in the blood flow you

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.659 
have decrement in the blood flow you
will<00:04:48.570> have<00:04:48.780> more<00:04:49.050> time<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:50.040> will<00:04:50.190> have<00:04:50.370> more

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
will have more time you will have more

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.350 
will have more time you will have more
time<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.690> extract<00:04:52.020> oxygen<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:54.060> will<00:04:54.210> have

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
time to extract oxygen so we will have

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.420 
time to extract oxygen so we will have
more<00:04:54.630> time<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.990> extract<00:04:55.260> oxygen<00:04:55.590> as<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.040> result

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
more time to extract oxygen as a result

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.640 
more time to extract oxygen as a result
of<00:04:56.580> more<00:04:56.820> time<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.330> extract<00:04:57.540> oxygen<00:04:57.840> oxygen

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
of more time to extract oxygen oxygen

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.990 
of more time to extract oxygen oxygen
content<00:04:58.949> in<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> venous<00:04:59.520> system<00:04:59.639> will<00:04:59.880> be

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
content in the venous system will be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760 
content in the venous system will be
decreased<00:05:00.450> that's<00:05:00.870> why<00:05:01.020> mixed<00:05:01.350> venous<00:05:01.470> oxygen

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
decreased that's why mixed venous oxygen

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.409 
decreased that's why mixed venous oxygen
content<00:05:02.250> will<00:05:02.520> be<00:05:02.550> decreased<00:05:02.940> in<00:05:03.000> both<00:05:03.180> cases

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
content will be decreased in both cases

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.930 
content will be decreased in both cases
again<00:05:03.900> what<00:05:04.410> is<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.650> reason<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:05.400> blood<00:05:05.610> flow

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
again what is the reason the blood flow

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.790 
again what is the reason the blood flow
will<00:05:06.090> decrease<00:05:06.479> as<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.720> result<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.260> decreasing

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
will decrease as a result of decreasing

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.250 
will decrease as a result of decreasing
in<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.040> blood<00:05:08.220> flow<00:05:08.550> which<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.540> which<00:05:10.110> is

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
in the blood flow which is the which is

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.870 
in the blood flow which is the which is
the<00:05:10.380> case<00:05:10.590> of<00:05:10.770> cardiogenic<00:05:11.130> hypovolemic

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
the case of cardiogenic hypovolemic

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.300 
the case of cardiogenic hypovolemic
shock<00:05:11.940> here<00:05:12.840> now<00:05:13.200> once<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.740> blood<00:05:13.889> flow<00:05:14.160> will

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
shock here now once the blood flow will

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.250 
shock here now once the blood flow will
decrease<00:05:14.700> you<00:05:14.940> would<00:05:15.030> have<00:05:15.210> more<00:05:15.540> time<00:05:15.810> you

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
decrease you would have more time you

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.460 
decrease you would have more time you
will<00:05:16.410> have<00:05:16.530> more<00:05:16.979> time<00:05:17.700> for<00:05:18.350> extraction<00:05:19.350> of

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
will have more time for extraction of

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.040 
will have more time for extraction of
oxygen<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.460> arterial<00:05:20.910> system<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.870> end

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
lotta pressure in this patient all on

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.820 
lotta pressure in this patient all on
the<00:05:53.340> decreasing<00:05:54.300> blood<00:05:54.479> pressure<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.110> don't

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
the decreasing blood pressure and don't

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.040 
the decreasing blood pressure and don't
forget<00:05:56.220> there<00:05:56.760> is<00:05:56.789> a<00:05:56.910> reflex<00:05:57.300> tachycardia<00:05:57.450> so

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
forget there is a reflex tachycardia so

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.839 
forget there is a reflex tachycardia so
the<00:05:58.200> heart<00:05:58.410> rate<00:05:58.560> is<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.250> heart<00:05:59.460> rate<00:05:59.550> will

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
the heart rate is the heart rate will

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.370 
the heart rate is the heart rate will
increase<00:06:00.000> but<00:06:00.479> Raja<00:06:00.810> will<00:06:00.930> decrease<00:06:01.260> the

increase but Raja will decrease the

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.409 
increase but Raja will decrease the
heart<00:06:01.560> rate<00:06:01.710> will<00:06:01.889> increase<00:06:01.979> so<00:06:02.370> for<00:06:02.669> basic

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
heart rate will increase so for basic

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.050 
heart rate will increase so for basic
