 need to allow yourself to be real and not 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.309
 hesitate to show other people who 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.570
 we really are with our 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.629
 disadvantages 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.330
 failures defeats both past and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.549
 current 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 I never thought about it before but 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.479
 Tbilisi here I was asked a question after 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 I told the law of transparency 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.020
 by nir guy raised his hand and ask 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 Nikolay something in my head is not 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 it is that you are talking about 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.780
 to your teacher jackie kennedy about what are you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.880
 because watching him came understanding 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.790
 what is the law of transparency he said 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 about the fact that he is the third time that his wife 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 17 year old son addict 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 that he suffers from overweight you know 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140
 Nikolay something in my head is not here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.070
 is shaping up 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.960
 you say that he is successful 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 man or well of course he's successful 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.630
 but people have not already and see how 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 deficiencies how can then be 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.899
 successful and unsuccessful at the same time 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.920
 I understand what the problem is most people 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.570
 who does not succeed in life 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.119
 most people think that successful 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 man is it then wherever 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.350
 look at his life and he is everywhere 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.350
 perfect and flawless 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.250
 I personally think about this 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.430
 ideal can only be robots and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.500
 people 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.410
 a and nato and people to see their 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.599
 disadvantages have their problems and have 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.660
 every super successful person on 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.709
 the earth has life problems 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.890
 tests and failures happen all the time 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.989
 and defeat and then I painted on 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.450
 flipchart chart I'm today and it's the same 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.310
 I'll draw you 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.549
 which shows how life looks 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:43.049
 successful person life successful 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.799
 human looks like a curved line where there is 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.260
 ups and downs and ups and there is a fall 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.940
 there are ups and there are ups and downs and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.849
 falls if you look at some one 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.819
 time point then a successful person can 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.640
 he can't be with me today 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.220
 quarrel with the wife or something does not work with 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.060
 children or maybe customer suppliers 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.190
 and summed or stars with a partner 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.350
 there was a quarrel today and failed 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.540
 agree and some point today 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.180
 he turned out to be in days but tomorrow he decided 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 his problems and again he is doing well 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.319
 it turns out there are no perfect people 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.549
 It happens people who all flawless 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.609
 if someone tells you that everything 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.280
 believe perfectly he tries you 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.639
 cheat this does not happen but what most 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.290
 important the most important thing in this curve is that 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.930
 when you look at him 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.640
 yes you will notice 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.579
 that she is not looking what she looks like 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:55.629
 both ups and downs she doesn't care 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:58.239
 where goes she goes up this is how 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.430
 life looks any super successful 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.299
 human super successful person understands 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.750
 what's important to me here today 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.480
 was at a higher level than 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.599
 was a week ago 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.340
 a month ago a year ago I want to 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.459
 thinking about this 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.000
 if you make mistakes if you 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:29.080
 experiencing failure in life is 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.889
 ok but what can you how can you 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:38.229

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.780

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.789

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.270
 it's an integral part of the journey and everything is fine 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:12.159
 there is never more than that 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.430
 to understand that you are a successful person 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:17.470
 you need to understand what is not success in order 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.810
 to understand what happiness is needed 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.810
 to experience what a misfortune is for 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.759
 to understand what truth is 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.220
 filled with happiness joy of support 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:32.620

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.210
 when there is no relationship and precisely thanks 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.639

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.710
 successful people become even more 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.810

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.370
 fluctuations every day they can better and 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.540
 better understand that they grow 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.889
 I have for you homework 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.540
 remember where you were five years ago 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.760
 ten years ago and compare with where you are 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.040
 there is now 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.850
 if you watch this video I'm practically 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.160
 one hundred percent sure that today we 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.460
 much more successful than you were 5 years 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.960
 back or ten years ago I ask you 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.960
 stop thinking that you are successful 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.639
 only when you are fine you are not 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.490
 can be successful 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.260
 so that everything is always good if 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.660
 this happens your life then 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.510
 think maybe you are a robot 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.490
 otherwise over or alien which is all 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.030
 by definition it should be good and you 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:39.229
 you superman okay if 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.889
 you go through recessions and take off and again 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.669
 falling and lifting and this is what it looks like 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.830
 a life 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:49.789
 a successful person is also important to 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:52.820
 everything went up and today was better than 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.380
 it was yesterday and please never again 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.419
 don't think that you are not successful 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.419
 man if you have everything anyway 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.430
 going up means you are a successful person a 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.190
 the reason people don't get 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.650
 successful in business life lies in 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.870
 the fact that they are making mistakes turns out 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.000
 turning out to be a certain my starts about 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.970
 I say I'm a loser I'm a loser 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.370
 and run this negative internal 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.199
 talk loser loser you become 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.449
 really more and more 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.090
 loser so what you need to think 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.460
 the fact that I am successful and today is just 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.150
 I pass another lesson from which I 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.470
 get out 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.660
 and rise even higher higher than before 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.240

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.940
