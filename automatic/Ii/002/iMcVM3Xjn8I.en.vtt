00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.120
 Hi darlings, whats up

 Look here back to bring one more 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.590
 video for you and today's craft 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.020
 It's not about makeup, okay? 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.720
 it's about makeup but it's not for 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.750
 maquiar tÃ¡ is a shorter video of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.170
 My friend, even though I was doing 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.570
 experiments and total efina certain I solved 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 pass on to you because it's a tip 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.220
 So wonderful, I searched the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.070
 internet and I do not find anything like it 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.559
 by the way I found it on the subject but 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.269
 I did not find what I did so I decided 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.410
 passing on to you today 's tip is very 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.899
 simple how to compress shadows blushes 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.580
 things that broke that are loose 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.509
 I saw on the internet that people 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.200
 compact with alcohol and place it undo 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.740
 everything that little one turns into 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.690
 new pozinho and compact with ao placed 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.710
 alcohol and will knead until he gets 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.440
 cute 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.220
 I discovered a new way because so 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.079
 people when I did with alcohol what 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.210
 happened to me I do not know if it happens with 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:42.520
 You 're a haunting subject, uol the blush. 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.460
 they did not stay curious do not know with that 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.229
 levezinho aspect not they were not 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.299
 they were like this more or less but not 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.619
 they were as close as they were 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.509
 originally it was and another they became a 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.250
 bit of smell and often was 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.780
 bush that I wanted to use I dropped 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.430
 roguishly because I 'm nothing 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.030
 You have seen the first video 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.360
 huh 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 and I let it go out there was that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.829
 that I wanted to use and now how do I 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.989
 I'll do it, I 'll have to share it 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.730
 Leave it to use at another time. 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.760
 because you have to leave it for 24 hours and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.370
 And this way I did I did not 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.989
 I needed to leave it dry I could use it 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.700
 at the time and a beautiful secret of beautiful is the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.170
 clothes iron 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.239
 just to remind you that if you are a child 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.040
 Ask for help from an adult because you 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.500
 It can burn, let's go then. 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.560
 so now start getting love, look at the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.480
 The first thing we'll do is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.760
 take all this little thing that's here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.959
 It's now we're going to knead well for 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.959
 that he gets very thin 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.080
 ready love after much threat 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.850
 he will stay like this 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.530
 hence what we compare to the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.170
 That we kneaded people will play 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.630
 Inside the little pot back, I'm ready. 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.630
 the spoon here is cute 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.520
 and now we get an iron 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:12.710
 It's okay to wear regular clothes and 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.710
 people are going to put pressure on that here 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.610
 Now we can fix our fingers. 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:39.290
 wait cool for a little bit because he 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:42.350
 It gets super peeling of course has a 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.940
 and let's put it one more time. 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.770
 to make sure you 're ready after 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.320
 to spend the little finger on him 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.930
 catch well looks good 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.120
 and we'll wait and give him a 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.670
 cooled is because like him with a 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.480
 his helmet around iron and people 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.610
 ironed it up it got hot 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.890
 so I'll wait for it to cool 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.350
 I'll make another shadow for you both. 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.720
 accelerated so that you do not get too 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.760
 long video I'll make one more and then 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.970
 back to show the two at the end to 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.970
 you 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.100
 good staff the end result is this 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.850
 Here you are giving it to me and I do not know how it is. 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.790
 that is the focus there but he does not 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.720
 transfer color it or it does not change the color 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:30.310
 how can you see what to do about a 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.820
 just that it does not change the cut and you 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.100
 can use it on time and it looks good 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.650
 you need not wait and dry and 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.570
 very good idea the same thing happened 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.160
 with the shadow 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.050
 She's the one here that I had to 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.200
 get her out of the place 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:53.470
 here the shadow she continues with the same 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:06:01.450
 color and you can use it on time too 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:04.660
 they look kaita does not fall and they get super 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.260
 Prezinho the very pretty and very easy 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.000
 to use 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.680
 So this is it, my loves, I hope 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.100

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.220
 How did you even make a video? 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.180
