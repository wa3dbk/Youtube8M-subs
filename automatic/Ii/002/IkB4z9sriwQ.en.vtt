is

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
is

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
think this is a nice size so it doesn't

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
think this is a nice size so it doesn't
say<00:01:07.020> anything<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.520> waterproof<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.760> water

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
resistant or long wearing which made me

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
resistant or long wearing which made me
a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.490> hesitant<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.299> buying<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
a little hesitant when buying it but I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
a little hesitant when buying it but I
guess<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.100> thought<00:01:14.189> oh<00:01:14.549> well<00:01:14.909> 20<00:01:15.689> dollars

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

my<00:01:54.810> opinion<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> drier<00:01:55.680> side<00:01:55.829> which<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
my opinion on the drier side which is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
my opinion on the drier side which is
where<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> flaking<00:01:57.000> comes<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> would

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
where the flaking comes in but it would

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
where the flaking comes in but it would
wear<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.829> or<00:01:59.219> wear<00:01:59.520> off<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.210> would

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
wear down or wear off it would

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.850 
wear down or wear off it would
especially<00:02:00.869> come<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> right<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.829> my

especially come off like right in my

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920 
especially come off like right in my
inner<00:02:02.130> corner<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.759> course<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> mono

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
litters problem areas the consistency

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
litters problem areas the consistency
was<00:02:06.540> almost<00:02:06.930> clay<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.770> that's<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> weird

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
was almost clay like that's the weird

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.820 
was almost clay like that's the weird
thing<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.270> came<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.479> my

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
thing that came to my

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.860 
thing that came to my
when<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.190> first<00:02:10.490> used<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.240> picked<00:02:11.450> up<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.720> my

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
when I first used it it picked up on my

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.390 
when I first used it it picked up on my
brush<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.290> easy<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.920> then<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.190> would<00:02:13.310> have

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
brush really easy but then I would have

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.040 
brush really easy but then I would have
a<00:02:13.460> lot<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.240> I'd<00:02:14.300> have<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.600> work<00:02:14.810> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
a lot on it and I'd have to work to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.570 
a lot on it and I'd have to work to
spread<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.410> out<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:15.980> some<00:02:16.220> parts<00:02:16.490> were

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
spread it out and then some parts were

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.370 
spread it out and then some parts were
kind<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:16.910> inconsistent<00:02:17.570> I'd<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.960> go<00:02:18.110> over

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
kind of inconsistent I'd have to go over

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.770 
kind of inconsistent I'd have to go over
them<00:02:18.530> what<00:02:18.890> else<00:02:19.220> like<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.850> said<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.120> used<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.630> for

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
them what else like I said I used it for

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.480 
them what else like I said I used it for
two<00:02:20.930> weeks<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.440> think<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.770> was<00:02:21.920> manageable

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
two weeks and I think it was manageable

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.640 
two weeks and I think it was manageable
it<00:02:22.910> didn't<00:02:23.270> kill<00:02:23.570> me<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:24.170> flakes<00:02:24.470> were

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
it didn't kill me the flakes were

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.200 
it didn't kill me the flakes were
definitely<00:02:25.070> annoying<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.820> wasn't<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
definitely annoying but it wasn't the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.030 
definitely annoying but it wasn't the
end<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> world<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.080> would<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:27.740> repurchase

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
end of the world and would I repurchase

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.850 
end of the world and would I repurchase
this<00:02:28.640> no<00:02:29.090> would<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.630> recommend<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.380> for<00:02:30.410> other

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
this no would I recommend it for other
