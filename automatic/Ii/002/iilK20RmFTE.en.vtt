is<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.290> location<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.190> aware<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> where

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
is one location that I'm aware of where

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350 
is one location that I'm aware of where
there's<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> chest<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> route<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:39.210> mean

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
there's a chest on the route and I mean

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
there's a chest on the route and I mean
I<00:00:39.570> ran<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.079> three<00:00:40.649> times<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:42.059> got<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I ran this three times and I got the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.299 
I ran this three times and I got the
chest<00:00:44.370> twice<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.710> it's<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> place<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:46.980> kind<00:00:47.219> of

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
chest twice so it's a place to kind of

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.990 
chest twice so it's a place to kind of
look<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.820> obviously<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.899> extra<00:00:49.110> for

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
look out for obviously a bit extra for

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
look out for obviously a bit extra for
your<00:00:51.000> farming<00:00:54.710> all<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
your farming all you want to do is just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
your farming all you want to do is just
keep<00:00:56.550> following<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> outside<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.109> cliff

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
keep following the outside of the cliff

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.260 
keep following the outside of the cliff
between<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> cliff<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> temple<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
between the cliff and the temple and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
between the cliff and the temple and
obviously<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.420> quite<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:04.260> there's<00:01:04.890> hardly

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
obviously it's quite like there's hardly

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.480 
obviously it's quite like there's hardly
any<00:01:05.309> enemies<00:01:05.729> around<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:08.100> don't<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
any enemies around so you don't get that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
any enemies around so you don't get that
much<00:01:08.670> interference<00:01:09.210> when<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.540> running

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
much interference when you're running

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.600 
much interference when you're running
this<00:01:10.439> run<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.100> there<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.189> quite<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
this run and there is quite a bit of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
this run and there is quite a bit of
water<00:01:14.820> around<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.159> location<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.310> luckily

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
water around the location but luckily

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
water around the location but luckily
isn't<00:01:18.000> too<00:01:18.150> deep<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> don't

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.450 
isn't too deep so it you know you don't
have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> swim<00:01:20.250> which<00:01:20.430> slows<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
have to swim which slows you down and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.950 
have to swim which slows you down and

you come past you know you just keep an
eye<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.729> up<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.150> where

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
eye out for the or and up here is where

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.480 
eye out for the or and up here is where
the<00:01:33.720> location<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> chest<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.159> between

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the location of the chest is is between

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
the location of the chest is is between
the<00:01:35.610> tree<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.360> stairwell<00:01:39.650> all<00:01:40.650> right

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the tree and the stairwell all right

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230 
the tree and the stairwell all right
we've<00:01:40.890> been<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.220> across<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.670> north<00:01:41.909> side

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
we've been going across the north side

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.380 
we've been going across the north side
of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.280> temple<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.520> you're<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.180> about<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
of the temple and you're just about to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
of the temple and you're just about to
come<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> part<00:01:46.049> where<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> cliff<00:01:46.590> keeps

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
come to a part where the cliff keeps

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.249 
come to a part where the cliff keeps
going<00:01:47.250> around<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.610> other<00:01:48.570> parts<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> map

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
going around to other parts of the map

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.889 
going around to other parts of the map
so<00:01:50.040> basically<00:01:50.820> around<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> when<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
so basically around here is when you

so basically around here is when you
want<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> head<00:01:52.590> back<00:01:52.770> towards<00:01:53.100> the
