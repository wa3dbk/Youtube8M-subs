path to the file that we want to create

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.479 
path to the file that we want to create
and<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:46.260> does<00:00:46.500> include<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> name<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
file that we want to create just like

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
file that we want to create just like
them<00:00:49.320> you're<00:00:50.030> creating<00:00:51.030> other<00:00:51.329> types<00:00:51.660> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
them you're creating other types of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.970 
them you're creating other types of
files<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.440> stream<00:00:52.739> writer<00:00:53.070> class<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
files you can stream writer class so I

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.069 
files you can stream writer class so I
already<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.399> copied<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
already have it all copied off but you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.750 
already have it all copied off but you
can<00:00:58.140> use<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> save<00:00:58.649> file<00:00:58.890> dialog<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
can use a save file dialog here if you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.529 
can use a save file dialog here if you
want<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.590> necessary<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
want but I think it's necessary so just

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
want but I think it's necessary so just
have<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> folder<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.549> doing

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
have the folder that's going in my doing

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550 
have the folder that's going in my doing
the<00:01:06.060> test<00:01:06.330> folder<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> name<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the test folder and then the name of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
the test folder and then the name of the
file<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.159> three<00:01:08.580> mines<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
file that you have three mines in you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.429 
file that you have three mines in you
called<00:01:09.600> X<00:01:09.900> doc<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.470> XML<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.930> second

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
called X doc one XML the second

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
called X doc one XML the second
parameter<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.070> calls<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> type<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
parameter that it calls for the type of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.070 
parameter that it calls for the type of
encoding<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.430> just<00:01:17.430> put<00:01:17.610> encoding<00:01:18.150> got<00:01:18.330> utf-8

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
encoding so just put encoding got utf-8

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
encoding so just put encoding got utf-8
it's<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.770> type<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> encoding<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.759> text

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
it's just a type of encoding for text

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.230 
it's just a type of encoding for text
you<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.240> so

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you don't really know what it is it so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.789

with<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.909> start<00:01:33.049> start<00:01:34.049> element<00:01:34.470> means<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
with the start start element means is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.880 
with the start start element means is
well<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.150> our<00:01:36.270> XML<00:01:36.810> document<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.439> had<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.770> a

formatting<00:04:27.550> equals<00:04:28.550> formatting<00:04:29.350> invented

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
formatting equals formatting invented

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.560 
formatting equals formatting invented
yeah<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:30.890> just<00:04:31.070> makes<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:31.460> look<00:04:31.640> a<00:04:31.880> lot

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
yeah so this just makes it look a lot

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.120 
yeah so this just makes it look a lot
better<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:32.990> now<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.350> can<00:04:33.560> actually<00:04:33.860> read<00:04:34.100> it

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
better and now you can actually read it

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.640 
better and now you can actually read it
and<00:04:34.910> this<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.390> just<00:04:35.420> how<00:04:35.810> we<00:04:36.110> wrote<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.560> before

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
and this is just how we wrote it before

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.940 
and this is just how we wrote it before
so<00:04:37.520> we<00:04:37.820> now<00:04:37.940> create<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.390> file<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.560> open<00:04:39.650> it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
so we now create the file and open it

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.670 
so we now create the file and open it
yeah<00:04:40.310> now<00:04:40.580> it's<00:04:41.030> much<00:04:41.450> easier<00:04:41.870> just<00:04:41.900> about<00:04:42.470> all

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
yeah now it's much easier just about all

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.100 
yeah now it's much easier just about all
on<00:04:42.710> one<00:04:43.040> line<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.550> if<00:04:44.540> we<00:04:44.630> wanted<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:44.960> create

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
on one line and if we wanted to create

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.320 
on one line and if we wanted to create
more<00:04:45.710> nodes<00:04:46.040> inside<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.580> here<00:04:46.700> such<00:04:46.970> as<00:04:47.120> for

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
more nodes inside of here such as for

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.450 
more nodes inside of here such as for
their<00:04:47.480> aging<00:04:47.900> email<00:04:48.230> we<00:04:49.040> could<00:04:49.190> do<00:04:49.280> that<00:04:49.400> very

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
their aging email we could do that very

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.120 
their aging email we could do that very
easily<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:50.660> all<00:04:51.020> we<00:04:51.230> have<00:04:51.350> to<00:04:51.410> do<00:04:51.620> really<00:04:51.860> is

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
easily so all we have to do really is

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.310 
easily so all we have to do really is
copy<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:54.160> new<00:04:55.160> writing<00:04:55.550> name<00:04:55.940> node<00:04:56.510> we'll
