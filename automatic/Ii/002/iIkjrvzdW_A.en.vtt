let's crack on with the emblem now to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.120 
let's crack on with the emblem now to
make<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.330> realistic<00:00:30.720> human<00:00:31.080> face<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:31.980> it's

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
make a realistic human face I think it's

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
make a realistic human face I think it's
really<00:00:32.369> important<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> start<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
really important to start with a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
really important to start with a
skeleton<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:35.430> skull<00:00:35.760> underneath<00:00:36.030> really

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
skeleton the skull underneath really

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.260 
skeleton the skull underneath really
color<00:00:37.140> gives<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.090> structure<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
color gives it the structure and the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.020 
color gives it the structure and the
body<00:00:39.510> behind<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.350> face<00:00:40.640> which<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.670> something

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
body behind the face which is something

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
body behind the face which is something
that<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> people<00:00:42.960> miss<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> that's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that a lot of people miss out and that's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
that a lot of people miss out and that's
why<00:00:44.219> I'm<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.329> quite<00:00:45.510> often<00:00:45.719> unrealistic

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
why I'm it's quite often unrealistic

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.200 
why I'm it's quite often unrealistic
when<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.920> people<00:00:47.250> try<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.579> faces<00:00:47.850> but

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
when that people try and make faces but

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
when that people try and make faces but
if<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.079> skull<00:00:49.620> behind<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
if you just put that skull behind it you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
if you just put that skull behind it you
know<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.480> gives<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.020> some<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
know it really gives it some kind of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.010 
know it really gives it some kind of
body<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.329> move<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.870> from

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
body and you can you can move on from

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.490 
body and you can you can move on from
