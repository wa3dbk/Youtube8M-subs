 opportunity we will be seeing the 38 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.740
 of divided if they want the table that 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 Visit www.att.com to enjoy it 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.449
 very well the theme starts in a way 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.930
 very simple as it says for the agreement 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.930
 of dimayor 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.220
 of the sun 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.140
 all this sequence of chords until 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.750
 begins to play the drums that is the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.750
 end of the introduction here goes slow 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.390
 at speed this would look like this 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.030
 with the same chords but this time 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 add the stripe chord to the end 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.000
 then it would be higher 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.180
 at low speed this sounds like this 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.319
 the speed we have is like this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.849
 for the pri is vision of the songs 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.270
 the part before the chorus but that 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.060
 comes after the verses that we live 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.570
 they repeat all chords simply the sun 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.630
 greater and D major in two eighths 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.630
 bars of each chord then only 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 9 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.640
 this would be this way 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.510
 again only eighth notes two measures 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.510
 to 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.010
 after two measures 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.580
 at speed 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.150
 the song continues with a chorus 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.760
 that occurs between the dishes 7 and 5 of the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.920
 guitar starts with finger 3 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:15.750
 in contrast 7 of the fifth goes to the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.750
 fret 5 of door 37 of the fifth 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.889
 then the song continues 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.240
 touching with finger 3 the 13 7 of the 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.110
 sixth by dante with 5 of the fifth 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.340
 rope 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.340
 repeat these last notes five times 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.340
 so 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:55.699
 and ends with finger 367 of the agreement 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.699
 this first half of the rif would sound like this 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.810
 is continuous in its second part 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.400
 repeating the beginning of the fourth 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.400
 previous is to say 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.160
 ah 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.160
 yes 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160
 yes 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:31.970
 and then repeat the same part of the 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:34.420
 previous 7 of the sixth and 53 times instead 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.420
 of 5 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.310
 and 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:49.200
 then all the river at low speed 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.200
 it would sound like this 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 m 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.720
 where 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.720
 again 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.449
 five times 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.160
 repeat the first part 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.999
 three times 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.879
 touching the rapids 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.669
 the last time
