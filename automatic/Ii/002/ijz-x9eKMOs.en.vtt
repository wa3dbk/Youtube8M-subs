been using a system myself since we're
the<00:01:42.780> last<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.320> five<00:01:43.829> months<00:01:44.460> we've<00:01:44.670> had

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

the last I think five months we've had
up<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.149> running<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.159> it's<00:01:47.159> been<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.610> most

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
up and running and it's been the most

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.359 
up and running and it's been the most
fruitful<00:01:48.240> flat<00:01:48.479> season<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.530> date<00:01:49.710> bar<00:01:50.340> none

and<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.600> front<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.439> you'll<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and in front of you you'll see on the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.850 
and in front of you you'll see on the
screen<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
screen actually you know that that that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
screen actually you know that that that
statement<00:01:59.189> almost<00:01:59.790> shouldn't<00:02:00.659> ring<00:02:00.869> true

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
statement almost shouldn't ring true

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
statement almost shouldn't ring true
because<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> look<00:02:01.979> over<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.310> 2009

because if you look over here 2009

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.600 
because if you look over here 2009
probably<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.380> far<00:02:04.619> since<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> system's<00:02:05.430> been

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
