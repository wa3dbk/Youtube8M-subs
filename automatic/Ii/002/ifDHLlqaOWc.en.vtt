00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
thing to do so basically got to go to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
thing to do so basically got to go to
these<00:00:48.780> crates<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.890> also<00:00:50.070> go<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
these crates and you also go to the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.029 
these crates and you also go to the
small<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> jump<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
small one to jump up and then I like to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.290 
small one to jump up and then I like to
go<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> edge<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> crate<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.210> then

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
go at the edge of the crate and then

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
go at the edge of the crate and then
kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.600> hop<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.010> that

kind of hop up like that and then that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.959 
kind of hop up like that and then that
time<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.520> obviously<00:00:56.820> failed<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.719> forget<00:00:58.710> that

good<00:01:05.309> thing<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.729> eventually<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.930> right

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
good thing of that eventually but right

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.800 
good thing of that eventually but right
here<00:01:07.290> i<00:01:07.350> press<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> hold<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.600> one

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.320 
here i press a and kind of hold you one
way<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> left<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.580> if

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
way or like the left of the right and if

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
way or like the left of the right and if
i<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> things<00:01:13.890> pushes<00:01:14.369> me

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
i have to if one of the things pushes me

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.609 
i have to if one of the things pushes me
then<00:01:15.060> i'll<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.930> across<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.470> wire

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
then i'll just go right across the wire

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.999 
then i'll just go right across the wire
for<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.640> blue<00:01:17.850> area<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> be

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
for that blue area and you got to be

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.260 
for that blue area and you got to be
careful<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.490> i<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
careful because i think there is a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.950 
careful because i think there is a
countdown<00:01:21.720> timer<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:23.009> eventually<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:23.960> guess

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
countdown timer that eventually i guess

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.920 
countdown timer that eventually i guess
make<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> fall<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:25.979> death<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.369> whatever

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
make you fall to your death or whatever

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.300 
make you fall to your death or whatever
but<00:01:27.930> those<00:01:28.560> were<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> whole<00:01:28.920> bunch<00:01:28.950> people

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but those were a whole bunch people

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
but those were a whole bunch people
failing<00:01:29.729> eventually<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.540> got<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:30.990> had<00:01:31.079> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
failing eventually they got it we had a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.069 
failing eventually they got it we had a
little<00:01:31.290> dance<00:01:31.560> party<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.540> besides<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> once

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
little dance party but besides that once

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679 
little dance party but besides that once
you're<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.590> platform<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.390> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you're on that little platform you can

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.620 
you're on that little platform you can
jump<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.770> tree<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.450> hop

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
jump to this tree and then you can hop

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.620 
jump to this tree and then you can hop
up<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.680> second<00:01:41.009> branch<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.210> want<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
up on the second branch and you want to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.850 
up on the second branch and you want to
go<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:43.049> closer<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
go a little bit closer to you so if you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.230 
go a little bit closer to you so if you
follow<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> first<00:01:44.939> branch

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
follow you go back to the first branch

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
follow you go back to the first branch
but<00:01:46.170> once<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> second<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:46.829> go<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
but once you have the second one go to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
but once you have the second one go to
the<00:01:47.189> third<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> i<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.540> go<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.200> bit

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the third and i just go up a little bit

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350 
the third and i just go up a little bit
and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.460> wanna<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> little

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and then you wanna be like a little

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.050 
and then you wanna be like a little
sprint<00:01:51.840> jump<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.619> off<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.159> jump<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
sprint jump right off and jump on that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
sprint jump right off and jump on that
platform<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.049> takes<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
platform and that takes a lot of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.039 
platform and that takes a lot of
practice<00:01:56.460> took<00:01:56.939> me<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.270> while<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.899> guys

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
practice took me a little while you guys

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.560 
practice took me a little while you guys
may<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.770> pro<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.820> do<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.299> away<00:02:00.329> but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
