00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:05.420 

right<00:06:00.129> so<00:06:00.339> I<00:06:00.399> guess<00:06:00.430> jury<00:06:00.999> survived

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:15.830 

apparently

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:26.959 

alright<00:06:16.840> let's<00:06:17.500> fall<00:06:17.949> into<00:06:18.370> elevator

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:46.469 

wondering<00:06:27.969> if<00:06:28.060> this<00:06:28.090> is<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.539> end<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.259> Act<00:06:29.500> two

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.110 

um

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.400 

stop<00:06:50.840> the<00:06:50.960> massacre<00:06:51.250> or<00:06:52.250> it<00:06:53.030> wasn't<00:06:53.210> him<00:06:54.199> as

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
stop the massacre or it wasn't him as

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:08.010 
stop the massacre or it wasn't him as
stopped<00:06:54.800> it<00:06:54.979> was<00:06:55.280> him<00:06:57.850> hello

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.320 

in<00:07:09.020> supplies<00:07:09.969> but<00:07:10.969> in<00:07:11.659> his<00:07:11.960> eyes<00:07:12.849> this<00:07:13.849> marked

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
in supplies but in his eyes this marked

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:24.129 
in supplies but in his eyes this marked
me<00:07:14.599> as<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:15.080> enemy<00:07:21.249> okay<00:07:22.249> Yuri<00:07:22.900> you<00:07:23.900> bought

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
me as the enemy okay Yuri you bought

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:37.600 
me as the enemy okay Yuri you bought
yourself<00:07:24.319> some<00:07:24.830> time<00:07:34.240> all<00:07:35.240> right<00:07:36.550> all<00:07:37.550> right

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
yourself some time all right all right

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.730 
yourself some time all right all right
so<00:07:38.539> I<00:07:38.599> guess<00:07:38.659> that<00:07:38.779> was<00:07:39.050> the<00:07:39.080> end<00:07:39.289> of<00:07:39.379> that<00:07:39.439> one

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 
so I guess that was the end of that one

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.670 
so I guess that was the end of that one
and<00:07:40.639> and<00:07:42.849> we're<00:07:43.849> looking<00:07:44.509> about<00:07:44.839> 15<00:07:45.439> minutes

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 
and and we're looking about 15 minutes

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.110 
and and we're looking about 15 minutes
