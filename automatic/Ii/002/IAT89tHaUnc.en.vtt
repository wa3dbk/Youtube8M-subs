this<00:00:22.970> weird

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.950 

two

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:01:07.680 

at<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.680> center<00:00:44.070> week

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:19.700 

ha

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.280 

it<00:01:20.710> has<00:01:20.890> been<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.250> long<00:01:21.280> process<00:01:22.050> which<00:01:23.050> I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
it has been a long process which I

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.010 
it has been a long process which I
started<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.690> way<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.740> reduce<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.960> much

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
started with the way to reduce as much

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.420 
started with the way to reduce as much
as<00:01:29.590> possible<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.960> technique<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.710> painting

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
as possible the technique of painting

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.470 
as possible the technique of painting
when<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.420> really<00:01:34.840> start<00:01:35.170> which<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.740> already

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
when I really start which is already

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.230 
when I really start which is already
many<00:01:37.480> years<00:01:37.810> ago<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.220> 65<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.490> get<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.210> a

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
many years ago in 65 so when I get to a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.170 
many years ago in 65 so when I get to a
certain<00:01:43.600> point<00:01:44.050> with<00:01:44.710> what<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.190> more<00:01:46.030> or<00:01:46.150> less

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
certain point with what I more or less

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.680 
certain point with what I more or less
wanted<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.980> field<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.550> painting<00:01:49.420> I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
wanted in the field of painting I

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.790 
wanted in the field of painting I
realized<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:51.540> whatsoever<00:01:52.540> you<00:01:52.960> do<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.590> are

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
realized that whatsoever you do you are

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.650 
realized that whatsoever you do you are
always<00:01:55.080> even<00:01:56.080> with<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.320> very<00:01:56.860> very<00:01:57.010> basic<00:01:57.850> kind

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
always even with a very very basic kind

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.700 
always even with a very very basic kind
of<00:01:58.900> object<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.700> are<00:02:00.880> more<00:02:01.300> or<00:02:01.450> less<00:02:01.479> band<00:02:02.320> and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
of object you are more or less band and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.830 
of object you are more or less band and
inside<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:04.119> very<00:02:04.750> specific<00:02:06.000> let's<00:02:07.000> head<00:02:07.240> system

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
inside a very specific let's head system

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.210 
inside a very specific let's head system
and<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.530> system<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.910> framed<00:02:10.690> by<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.350> gallery

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and that system is framed by the gallery

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.860 
and that system is framed by the gallery
of<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.300> museum<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:15.280> wanted<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.880> see<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.510> it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
of the museum and I wanted to see if it

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.490 
of the museum and I wanted to see if it
was<00:02:17.110> possible<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.860> continue<00:02:18.310> such<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.850> work

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
was possible to continue such a work

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.100 
was possible to continue such a work
outside<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.250> frame<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.330> started<00:02:22.810> then

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
outside of that frame and I started then

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.199 
outside of that frame and I started then
to<00:02:23.140> work<00:02:24.209> mostly<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> street<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:28.000> of

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
to work mostly in the street and then of

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.870 
to work mostly in the street and then of
course<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:29.200> work<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.590> was<00:02:29.620> doing<00:02:29.860> was<00:02:30.519> not

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
course the work I was doing was not

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.259 
course the work I was doing was not
possible<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.840> used<00:02:32.590> anymore<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:34.060> only

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
possible to be used anymore and I only

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.990 
possible to be used anymore and I only
kept<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:35.650> was<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.160> background<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.940> my

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
kept what was the background of my

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.490 
kept what was the background of my
painting<00:02:37.690> which<00:02:37.989> was<00:02:38.489> vertical<00:02:39.989> stripes<00:02:40.989> so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
painting which was vertical stripes so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.620 
painting which was vertical stripes so
in<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.769> way<00:02:41.950> these<00:02:42.220> vertical<00:02:42.850> stripes<00:02:43.209> which

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
in a way these vertical stripes which

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.600 
in a way these vertical stripes which
are<00:02:44.130> always<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.550> same<00:02:45.820> since<00:02:46.410> 65<00:02:47.410> are<00:02:48.220> still

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
are always the same since 65 are still

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.850 
are always the same since 65 are still
used<00:02:48.880> today<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:49.600> in<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.900> very<00:02:49.930> different<00:02:50.470> way

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
used today but in a very different way

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.030 
used today but in a very different way
as<00:02:51.190> soon<00:02:51.489> as<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.900> quit<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.250> strictly<00:02:55.019> some

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
as soon as I quit what was strictly some

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
as soon as I quit what was strictly some
way<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.100> work<00:02:57.670> with<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:59.560> painting<00:03:00.100> not<00:03:00.850> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
way to work with this painting not to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.720 
way to work with this painting not to
said<00:03:01.330> it's<00:03:01.360> not<00:03:02.080> any<00:03:02.320> more<00:03:02.410> paintings<00:03:03.220> because

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
said it's not any more paintings because

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.030 
said it's not any more paintings because
I<00:03:03.790> don't<00:03:04.120> really<00:03:04.209> care<00:03:04.660> less<00:03:04.959> if<00:03:05.739> it's

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
I don't really care less if it's

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.660 
I don't really care less if it's
separate<00:03:06.820> or<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.450> still<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:08.080> partly<00:03:08.800> work

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
separate or if it still but partly work

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.080 
separate or if it still but partly work
as<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.269> painting<00:03:10.959> but<00:03:11.260> it's<00:03:12.130> not<00:03:12.280> anymore<00:03:12.850> with

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
as a painting but it's not anymore with

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.050 
as a painting but it's not anymore with
the<00:03:13.239> concept<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.110> frame<00:03:14.500> or<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:15.130> with<00:03:16.030> the

workings of that salt and
it's<00:03:20.200> involved<00:03:21.200> space<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.900> site<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:25.810> my

it's involved space and the site and my
ID<00:03:27.230> with<00:03:27.920> using<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.550> stripes<00:03:29.120> it's<00:03:29.480> always<00:03:29.900> to

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
ID with using the stripes it's always to

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.380 
ID with using the stripes it's always to
use<00:03:31.090> reference<00:03:32.090> which<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:33.290> visual<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.400> which

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
use reference which is visual and which

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.120 
use reference which is visual and which
is<00:03:35.920> being<00:03:36.920> always<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.550> same<00:03:38.710> has<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.740> quality

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
is being always the same has a quality

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.570 
is being always the same has a quality
of<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.670> tool<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.530> as<00:03:43.010> soon<00:03:43.070> as<00:03:43.400> you

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
of a tool so it's like as soon as you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.540 
of a tool so it's like as soon as you
know<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.480> recognize<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.650> when<00:03:46.400> you

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
know it you can recognize and when you

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.610 
know it you can recognize and when you
recognize<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.660> also<00:03:47.980> calculate<00:03:49.270> just<00:03:50.620> an

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
recognize you can also calculate just an

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.790 
recognize you can also calculate just an
idea<00:03:51.890> if<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.550> start<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.060> count<00:03:53.300> all<00:03:53.800> the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
idea if you start to count all the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.980 
idea if you start to count all the
stripes<00:03:55.160> which<00:03:55.640> are<00:03:55.910> behind<00:03:56.150> me<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:56.810> will

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
stripes which are behind me you will

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.190 
stripes which are behind me you will
know<00:03:57.230> exactly<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.980> size<00:03:58.220> of<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.700> wall<00:03:59.200> so

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
know exactly the size of the wall so

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.090 
know exactly the size of the wall so
that's<00:04:00.440> one<00:04:00.740> way<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.820> read<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:03.470> see<00:04:03.770> the
