 memory system and projects which 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:12.949
 processes 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.549
 may apply for one operation 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.880
 uniquely for temporary storage 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.859

 processor overfulfillment 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.559
 operations with each person 

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.539
 RAM we together 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.429
 individually 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.689
 RAM is one of 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.539
 most important elements of the computer is her 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.699
 the process goes the program source 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.449
 data for processing it is registered 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.070
 results obtained name operational 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.199
 This memory received because she 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.070
 works in very fast so 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.289
 the processor is practically not 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.510
 have to wait to read data from 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.909
 memory and records 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.329
 however, data containing data is saved 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.760
 only while the computer is connected 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.640
 bodywork can be made as 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.580
 separate block go 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.030
 in the design, however, no steel surfaces 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.700

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.960
 RAM appeared by words

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.710
 since the board on which is recorded 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 intermediate results with 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.600
 problem solving can also be considered 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 random access memory 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.920
 but such views are interesting to us therefore 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620
 let's see what passions 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.590
 used when creating the village 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.740
 computers of different generations 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 the first computers used cast 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.920

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.780
 perform functions 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 main memory ie hundreds or 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 millennia 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.460
 some of which were with arbitrary 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.590
 access some 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.400
 a prime example of vacuum memory 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.020
 played with victor 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.350
 all the same electrostatics

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.060
 all this he turned out the dollar had a number 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.569
 production problems 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.790
 and do not enjoy success 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.050
 locks and constantly drive laws 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.280
 and put discrete transistors 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 used in quantities of more 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.409
 direct access memory often 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.900
 was created using

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.359

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.319
 magnetic cores 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.589
 developed in 1949 1951 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.079
 and the consequences are used in

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.480
 not applicable
