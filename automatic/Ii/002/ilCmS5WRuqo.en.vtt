00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 this weekend the test is disputed 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.179
 most important area upon four 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.549
 wheels and for this the different 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 crews 4x4 challenge no 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.890
 They spare every effort to prepare the best 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.350
 possible your vehicles but this test 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 it's not like any other design the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.029
 tracing and level required to overcome 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.980
 every obstacle makes only the best 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 of the country are able to achieve this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.870
 travel to the goal and better yet in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 the shortest time but which is really 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:43.980
 the challenge facing things 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
 sections are heavily loaded water 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 they place along the route as 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 part of the obstacles between tests 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 also one is formed right at the foot of the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.370
 hip hop one of the most steps 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.370
 Spectacular of the competition 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 ah 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.510
 the bucs are mounds of earth very 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.200
 similar to those used in motocross 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.980
 traditionally they are also called 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.410
 saw 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.450
 but they are even more pronounced with 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.550
 more marked levels that allow to put 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.780
 to the maximum torsion of the chassis 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.520
 among others the cucas make up a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.450
 section loaded with large timber 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.950
 size placed one followed by the other 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.230
 crossing the two lanes some 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 crews take this section with 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.700
 a lot of technique others take advantage for the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.600
 speed depending on the qualities 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600
 of your vehicle 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.110
 the mud trap is located in a curve 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.630
 unevenness also known as the elbow 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.940
 since it takes this boxed form of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.070
 way that the pilot's handling is measured 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:01.390
 and the traction of the vehicle is what 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:03.909
 popularly we call a peladero later 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.490
 comes a stretch of giant stones 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.560
 stacked along both lanes in 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.959
 the suspension of the vehicles 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.920
 they test this is one of the most 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.920
 hard of the project 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.680
 the test of the irazú hill is a small 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.500
 mountain that traditionally precedes the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.989
 main hill the chirripó and lets go 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.720
 measuring the attraction of the car and driving 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.290
 it is equally technical the descent as 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.290
 the rise 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.780
 the chipo is a mountain of 8 meters 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.459
 height with an ascent in which it is measured 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.099
 the attraction and a descent practically 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.470
 vertical that requires a technique 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.420
 impeccable is the queen proof of 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.500
 circuit and where traditionally 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.780
 present the greatest incidents since 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.430
 the previous edition has added a 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.200
 try more on the goal where 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.599
 previously the co-pilot would make a 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.330
 portillo finca style for the car 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.190
 will happen now just before the goal 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.470
 will be marked from the area where the car 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.239
 must stop and then the goal 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.670
 the buried toques will be 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.799
 vertically where the copilot should 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 hook the wing the circulations 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.840
 they should then on 'www inflate the car 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.850
 and put it into action so that this is the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.860
 to drag the vehicle along the line 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.049
 goal with this also increases the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.870
 participation of the co-pilot and work 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.220
 as a team 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.230
 definitely a challenge to achieve 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.900
 reach the goal in the shortest possible time 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.480
 without getting stuck in any of these 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.880
 obstacles and just for this to 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.840
 spectacular tests the cars what 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.390
 they must also be originally these 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.400
 cars can be like any 4x4 that 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.920
 circulates in the streets of the country without 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.110
 However, they are modified and set to two of 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.020
 so that they can pass obstacles 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.730
 As for the regulation they are grouped in 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.490
 categories four six eight 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.730
 cylinders are also not allowed to use 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.650
 nitrous oxide starting from these its 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.650
 engines are worked in search of 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.140
 greater power and torque or strength that are 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.750
 the most basic points needed in the 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.700
 test nonetheless there is a balance 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.670
 between having the highest torque but at 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.440
 same time being light looking for the 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.170
 maximum complement in that relationship 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.300
 strength is just the key to 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.430
 get well rid of the tests then 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.800
 some require speed other than 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.660
 resistance and some strength the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 suspension is one of the parts that most 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.120
 you work with her you are looking 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.710
 resistance the cto of this can also 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 be according to the characteristics of the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.270
 carriage and the pilot's handling for example 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.180
 to overcome tests like stones 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.370
 giants the more you fit will yield 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.160
 better the obstacle that more puts to the test 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.110
 the suspension are the bucs the rims 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.450
 that are used in this competition are from 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.000
 very large measures above 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.800
 that normally must be traveled 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.080
 besides looking logically the biggest 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.270
 traction with them is looking for the greatest 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.370
 height so that the part of 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.680
 below the vehicle do not get hurt or 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.540
 get trapped in the mud in this 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.880
 test you can see tires of a 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.060
 diameter up to 40 inches in height 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.190
 the most popular are the cmt or the super 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.380
 samper in tests like the rise and 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.600
 descent of the chipo these are justly 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.820
 the most efficient 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.980
 finally adapt a wing is 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.710
 indispensable because it is the additional support 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.620
 most important with which they can count 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.470
 in case of getting caught is a winche 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.240
 they range from 8,000 to 15,000 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.240
 pounds depending on the weight of the vehicle 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.949
 they are also indispensable by regulation 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.780
 since the james test was included 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.940
 next Sunday we will know who they are 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.789
 the new monarchs of mud in the 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.490
 4x4 challenge the tickets are already at 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.490
