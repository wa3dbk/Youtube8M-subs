good construction as you can see and
here<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:31.040> man<00:00:32.040> filter<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
here we have the man filter which is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.260 
here we have the man filter which is
also<00:00:33.660> made<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.079> Germany<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.850> we've<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.120> made

also made in Germany and we've got made
in<00:00:36.360> Germany<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.680> also<00:00:37.829> has<00:00:38.219> pretty<00:00:38.550> good

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
in Germany and it also has pretty good

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.610 
in Germany and it also has pretty good
construction<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.079> almost<00:00:40.410> identical

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
construction and it's almost identical

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
construction and it's almost identical
it<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.700> much<00:00:41.850> identical<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:44.329> Audi

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it was pretty much identical to the Audi

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
it was pretty much identical to the Audi
filter<00:00:46.129> just<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:48.379> wording<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
filter just at the wording and the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
filter just at the wording and the
pictures<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> filter<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.449> different<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
pictures on the filter is different the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.760 
pictures on the filter is different the
threads<00:00:53.309> look<00:00:53.460> pretty<00:00:53.760> much<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> same<00:00:54.770> feels

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
threads look pretty much the same feels

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
threads look pretty much the same feels
like<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> same<00:00:56.309> material<00:00:56.789> pretty

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
like it's the same material pretty

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.040 
like it's the same material pretty
durable

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
durable

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.150 
durable
even<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.270> audi<00:01:00.270> filter<00:01:00.870> also<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
even the audi filter also there's the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.750 
even the audi filter also there's the
part<00:01:02.699> number<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> man<00:01:03.449> filter<00:01:03.809> which<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
part number of the man filter which is

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.969 
part number of the man filter which is
w71<00:01:05.760> 9/4<00:01:06.540> 5<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.400> w71<00:01:09.240> 9/4<00:01:09.960> 5<00:01:10.170> let's

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
w71 9/4 5 and here it is w71 9/4 5 let's

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.200 
w71 9/4 5 and here it is w71 9/4 5 let's
go<00:01:11.100> ahead<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> open<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:11.760> filters<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
go ahead and open up these filters and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.920 
go ahead and open up these filters and
see<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:12.510> look<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.689> inside<00:01:17.570> ok<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.630> now

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
see what they look like inside ok so now

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
see what they look like inside ok so now
that<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.560> two<00:01:19.830> filters<00:01:20.100> cut<00:01:21.060> open

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that I have these two filters cut open

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.499 
that I have these two filters cut open
let's<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.560> at<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> filters<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
let's take a look at the filters so this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.550 
let's take a look at the filters so this
one<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.049> OEM<00:01:25.710> outer<00:01:26.040> filter<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
one here is the OEM outer filter and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.020 
one here is the OEM outer filter and
this<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.960> man<00:01:30.960> filter<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
this one here is the man filter and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.600 
this one here is the man filter and
let's<00:01:33.030> look<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.479> back<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.490> sorry<00:01:35.490> for

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
let's look at the back of it sorry for

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.249 
let's look at the back of it sorry for
the<00:01:35.670> shadow<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> back<00:01:40.229> of

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the shadow there so this is the back of

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.020 
the shadow there so this is the back of
the<00:01:40.409> filter<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:41.159> look<00:01:41.340> identical<00:01:41.520> these<00:01:41.909> are

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the filter they look identical these are

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.499 
the filter they look identical these are
the<00:01:42.119> ports<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:43.259> where<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.890> oil<00:01:44.850> fills<00:01:45.329> into

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the ports from where the oil fills into

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
the ports from where the oil fills into
the<00:01:45.689> filter<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.189> ports<00:01:47.430> where

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the filter and these are the ports where

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.960 
the filter and these are the ports where
the<00:01:47.610> filter<00:01:47.939> oil<00:01:47.970> enters<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.170> engine<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
the filter oil enters the engine and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.280 
the filter oil enters the engine and
they're<00:01:50.970> almost<00:01:51.149> identical<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.259> only

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
they're almost identical the only

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.940 
they're almost identical the only
difference<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.960> OEM<00:01:55.320> filter<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
difference is that in the OEM filter you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
difference is that in the OEM filter you
can<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.719> port<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
can see that this port right here is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.969 
can see that this port right here is
threaded<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> little<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.579> deeper<00:01:59.880> than<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
threaded a little bit deeper than the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.300 
threaded a little bit deeper than the
Matt<00:02:01.979> filter<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> construction<00:02:04.920> looks

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
Matt filter but the construction looks

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.449 
Matt filter but the construction looks
almost<00:02:05.549> identical<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.979> now<00:02:08.099> let's<00:02:08.310> take<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
almost identical so now let's take a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.290 
almost identical so now let's take a
deeper<00:02:08.759> look<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.090> these<00:02:09.179> filters

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
deeper look into these filters

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.110 
deeper look into these filters
so<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> OEM<00:02:11.800> filter<00:02:15.030> pulling<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so this is the OEM filter pulling the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.460 
so this is the OEM filter pulling the
canister<00:02:16.600> out<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.570> here<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> bottom<00:02:20.380> of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
canister out and here at the bottom of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.360 
canister out and here at the bottom of
the<00:02:20.560> filter<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.300> plate<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.370> right

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the filter we have this plate and right

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.300 
the filter we have this plate and right
here<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.940> pressure<00:02:25.810> relief<00:02:26.110> valve<00:02:26.320> so

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
here is the pressure relief valve so

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.490 
here is the pressure relief valve so
this<00:02:28.150> plate<00:02:28.420> what<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.840> does<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.140> keeps<00:02:29.380> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
this plate what it does it keeps the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.380 
this plate what it does it keeps the
filter<00:02:30.310> from<00:02:30.430> bottoming<00:02:30.820> out<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
filter from bottoming out of the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.000 
filter from bottoming out of the
canister<00:02:31.870> which<00:02:32.290> allows<00:02:32.500> oil<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:35.010> actually

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
canister which allows oil to actually

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.830 
canister which allows oil to actually
flow<00:02:36.190> into<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> pressure<00:02:36.760> relief<00:02:37.060> valve<00:02:37.270> just

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
flow into the pressure relief valve just

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.350 
flow into the pressure relief valve just
in<00:02:38.020> case<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.830> filter<00:02:39.190> element<00:02:39.370> I'm<00:02:40.030> sorry<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
in case the filter element I'm sorry the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.990 
in case the filter element I'm sorry the
filter<00:02:40.600> media<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.900> blocked<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.350> or<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.640> oil<00:02:42.880> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
filter media is blocked up or the oil is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.440 
filter media is blocked up or the oil is
too<00:02:43.150> viscous<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.870> go<00:02:43.990> through<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.230> media<00:02:45.450> so

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
too viscous to go through the media so

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.580 
too viscous to go through the media so
this<00:02:46.570> right<00:02:46.690> here<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:46.930> an<00:02:47.050> anti<00:02:47.230> backflow

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
this right here is an anti backflow

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.520 
this right here is an anti backflow
valve<00:02:47.830> which<00:02:48.100> feels<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:49.350> silicone<00:02:50.350> material

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
valve which feels like silicone material

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.970 
valve which feels like silicone material
feels<00:02:51.160> pretty<00:02:51.310> good<00:02:51.760> quality<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.830> is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
feels pretty good quality and this is

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.670 
feels pretty good quality and this is
the<00:02:54.100> media<00:02:54.370> here<00:02:54.580> itself

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
the media here itself

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.650 
the media here itself
this<00:02:56.680> looks<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> really<00:02:57.970> good<00:02:58.450> quality

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
this looks to be a really good quality

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.890 
this looks to be a really good quality
also<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.880> now<00:03:04.000> let's<00:03:04.330> take<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> look<00:03:04.630> at<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
also so now let's take a look at the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:14.520 
also so now let's take a look at the
main<00:03:05.050> filter<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.830> now<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:14.020> pretty

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
main filter and now you have pretty

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.770 
main filter and now you have pretty
similar<00:03:14.860> construction<00:03:20.880> these<00:03:21.880> plates<00:03:22.600> look

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
similar construction these plates look

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.150 
similar construction these plates look
pretty<00:03:22.990> much<00:03:23.170> identical<00:03:23.350> they're<00:03:23.980> pretty

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
pretty much identical they're pretty

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.560 
pretty much identical they're pretty
much<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> same<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.870> here<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.230> what<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:30.570> anti

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
much the same so here is what the anti

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.880 
much the same so here is what the anti
drain<00:03:31.780> valve<00:03:32.020> on<00:03:32.200> both<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.470> these<00:03:32.530> photos<00:03:32.860> look

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
drain valve on both of these photos look

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.610 
drain valve on both of these photos look
like<00:03:33.160> together<00:03:33.490> they<00:03:33.940> look<00:03:34.090> identical<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.500> me

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
like together they look identical to me

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.730 
like together they look identical to me
they're<00:03:35.830> pretty<00:03:36.160> much<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.370> same

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
they're pretty much the same

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.220 
they're pretty much the same
the<00:03:39.480> high<00:03:40.480> pressure<00:03:40.720> relief<00:03:41.200> valve<00:03:41.850> also

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
the high pressure relief valve also

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.070 
the high pressure relief valve also
looks<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.320> same

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.680 

and<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.770> have<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:48.950> filter<00:03:49.250> media<00:03:49.520> which<00:03:49.690> also

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
and you have the filter media which also

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.250 
and you have the filter media which also
looks<00:03:51.220> identical<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.870> feel<00:03:54.080> like<00:03:54.110> that

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
looks identical so I feel like that

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.830 
looks identical so I feel like that
demand<00:03:54.710> filter<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.940> an<00:03:56.120> awesome<00:03:56.420> emplacement

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
demand filter is an awesome emplacement

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.330 
demand filter is an awesome emplacement
for<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:56.990> alley<00:03:57.080> filter<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.800> me<00:03:57.920> they're<00:03:58.250> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
for the alley filter to me they're the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
for the alley filter to me they're the
exact<00:03:58.640> same<00:03:58.670> filter<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.910> only<00:04:02.060> difference<00:04:02.300> I

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
exact same filter the only difference I

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.570 
exact same filter the only difference I
noticed<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> threading<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> port<00:04:04.400> in

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
noticed is the threading in the port in

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.790 
noticed is the threading in the port in
which<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.940> filter<00:04:05.890> filter<00:04:06.890> oil<00:04:06.920> goes<00:04:07.370> through

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
which the filter filter oil goes through

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.140 
which the filter filter oil goes through
so<00:04:09.800> this<00:04:09.980> filter<00:04:10.160> actually<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.730> got<00:04:10.910> from

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
so this filter actually I got from

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.110 
so this filter actually I got from
Amazon<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:12.320> was<00:04:12.440> like<00:04:12.680> 13<00:04:13.280> bucks<00:04:13.490> I'll<00:04:13.820> leave<00:04:14.090> a

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120
