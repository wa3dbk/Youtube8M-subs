00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello youtube both love out there today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.040
 if there are my tips for hand luggage 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.740
 you travel whether by ship per 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.630
 car by train or by plane 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.130
 My stuff is now explicit for 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.619
 airplane and I have that in a few 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 tips and tricks and a few good ones 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.980
 ideas that help you if that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.960
 next time in the plane rises 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.990
 Of course, the video becomes mine 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.010
 experience reading series or the in 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.779
 Singapore 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.490
 which in any case in the hand luggage 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.630
 have so new passport and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.009
 I believe that it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.610
 of course I have such a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 beautiful case of h &amp; m brings that is so 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.350
 rosy I know it now dazzles clearly 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.820
 through the sun 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 but it's really my passport too 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.149
 really have seen inside that is 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.410
 simply beautiful packaging is also 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.129
 of course protected so now 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.430
 somebody gets sick in the car and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.120
 In Europe, then, after all, is only 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.100
 the case and not the passport messed up 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.600
 she looks completely different from me 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 I'm just turning on the front 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 for the videos is bringing in singapore and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 He still has a great tip 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 I do not want you here 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.750
 withheld and let the whole 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.130
 cards in the wallet api 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 payback card loyalty card points 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.750
 Collection card for frozen yogurt or something 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.900
 Also, always leave it at home only takes 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.009
 your bank cards with 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.960
 And if you do not need the ID card 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 you can also leave at home as well as the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 key less ballast more 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.930
 Relaxation 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.689
 a second tip is this little one 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.070
 travel package there are once that is one 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.450
 sleep cool in there you can do it now 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.140
 unfortunately not see through the brightness 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.000
 is a sleep mask in there and so on 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.770
 neck pillow what you lay around 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 because sometimes it is like that when you are 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.570
 in the train or in the car then sleeps 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 it's more like that someday 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 under bangs it is totally uncomfortable for 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 the neck and that the man hangs so 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.670
 is the possibility that one sabbat and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.860
 to carry the others along 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 that also looks relatively high because of that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.890
 I have this time for this time 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.160
 Nacken coastal decided because I 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.980
 namely really such a 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.590
 also shoulders kuschela in the airplane am 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.119
 the weather then does not want with that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 I do not mean my neighbor with it 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.830
 harass and therefore have this 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.240
 nackenrolle magic by the way also from h &amp; m 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.390
 I thought that was so low because it was pink 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.680
 is exactly i am a girl me 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.770
 That's why I'm not allowed to fly many 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.780
 get used to fluids that will 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.640
 be with my bag a lot with me 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.260
 I think travel then has to and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.790
 have great when you are in the plane 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.100
 Best travel something transparent 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.530
 because the nice people at the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.100
 control at the airport are so often 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.930
 bad temper annoyed and practice their 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.920
 Power position quite unfriendly 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.570
 that's why I can not go with the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.760
 to get together and have it all 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.959
 nicely done fine so that 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360
 By the way, if has can from the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.739
 I called everyone on the bedroom 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.230
 say that he has a sim-lock 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.060
 should use loot because we have 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.660
 Mario Barth learned that life 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.220
 save 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 you have a whole and cosmetics 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.500
 spent in it because someone if one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.709
 bomb can then transport nothing 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.130
 because it happens like it once 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.049
 briefly popov and device finally 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.790
 without nonsense what should that with these 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.290
 tip bag times ne short question on 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.130
 rande writes me the comments if 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 you make it smarter what's in there 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.870
 is, on the one hand, the agent of infection 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.590
 the infection with is easy for me 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.850
 I'm so small 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.140
 bacteria munk and ultimately needs 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.239
 not the very urgent 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.470
 and I 'm just thinking about this shirt 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.920
 It can be really nice 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.799
 I actually take the holidays 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.239
 because my suitcase already packed up 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.320
 Every case of disinfectant must be with 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.540
 whom you look, I considered it to me 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.989
 again on long distances will be yours 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.880
 that 's what the dorsten because the 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.709
 Aeration airplanes dries the skin like that 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.500
 that's why I have one 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.060
 small size of my voice tracer 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.709
 packed that they are now the chip it 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.239
 performance most racer with 15 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.769
 sun protection factor of benefit but me 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.630
 will take a spray with me here as well 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.070
 it was a lukas prehm easier to 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:13.730
 refresh what I do now 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:16.780
 Go hammering for you as well 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.630
 feedback that is just as free after 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.980
 dust that is totally pleasant totally beautiful 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.960
 I 'm looking forward to it in the plane too 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.310
 use and my hands were allowed 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.510
 of course, and that's why I will 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.400
 Take this hand cream with me 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.900
 now you do not pay because that's it 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 somehow also in fulfillment strokes 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.650
 a little self-evident is that way 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.090
 waiting for pastors chopsticks such a face 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.350
 cleaning cloth or something because I like it 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.130
 if you fly for a long time I fly now 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.390
 two hours 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.040
 and I will be there once 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.440
 at least somehow freshen up 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.790
 That's why it needs to and if so 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.620
 you have refreshed then it is too 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.810
 not that bad 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.550
 good to smell you can do that here 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.680
 nice use so you 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.350
 favorite perfume miniature also exists 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.020
 such few for the things 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.840
 I think I trust choice or something 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.450
 can you get out of a real big one 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.210
 cardboard packaging just before the couple 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.220
 pump out and then has a smaller one 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.320
 travels of it 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.500
 and of course the joh but this 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.500
 maybe a little tip is when I am 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.700
 I am so under these ampoules me 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.250
 I will not take all of them with me 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.980
 I will cut out 1 of each 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.250
 for every flight that are once eyes 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.650
 concentrate and then moisture 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.720
 victoire lottner i mean you are sitting there 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.890
 several hours in the plane why that 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 do not use it to regenerate and 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.740
 maybe a small majority too 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.090
 and I will do that 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.520
 when i slept just before i got to sleep 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.810
 arrive so two hours so I then 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.630
 Also look fresh when I picked up 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.910
 my next tip is something 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.000
 helpless said you're actually thinking 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.250
 stupid or something but I just want him 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.940
 record because there is a small one 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.240
 anecdote 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.160
 they say yes in the plane is so much 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.310
 program 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.290
 So of film music to play there need 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.810
 I do not because I can 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.270
 even at the airport would be against me 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.130
 to buy a magazine and you can 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.720
 be defiant all over because of that 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.150
 entertainment system is down is 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.200
 the sven that happens at our 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.340
 Thailand Holiday I should say now 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.140
 not available anymore 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.260
 but in any case, namely something to 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.030
 read with and that can also be by bus 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.500
 and make a ship so i will 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.480
 I take so heavy a journal with me 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.860
 Of course, the guide to another 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.810
 a few things to go through and me still 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.940
 to be more happy and I have one too 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.980
 book bought coop piece himself into the coach 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.390
 not to be a bit smarter to 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.930
 and not completely on vacation 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.070
 dismantle and the last hand luggage is 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.800
 then already what I show is a 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.870
 scarf so a big scarf no matter where 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.330
 he can go nice in the 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.900
 bag so you can hug 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.050
 make tiny 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.480
 but sometimes that is also during 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.320
 the trip in the flight flier also something like that 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.970
 cooler 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.860
 and then you can do that perfectly 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.700
 take and be with it a bit 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.470
 a stroll or, of course, around 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.140
 not to get sick in the neck 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.640
 vacation to start 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.320
 That was my tip for my hand luggage 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.700
 I hope one or the other was there 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.500
 helped you out i would totally fuck me 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.640
 if you send me the comments 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.190
 Write something in your hand luggage 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.900
 takes what I did not mention because 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.240
 we are here community-sides us 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.610
 help each other and I make you 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.100
 still my experience the playlist in 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.710
 the infobox as well as my others 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.700
 the videos I know that was not 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.960
