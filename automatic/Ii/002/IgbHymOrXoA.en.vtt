and then then it goes yellow to to read
I<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.740> basically<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.240> try

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
I think and then basically you can try

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
I think and then basically you can try
them<00:02:29.569> all<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.470> tells<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.010> the

I<00:05:35.320> try<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.350> bypass<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:37.190> I<00:05:37.250> didn't<00:05:37.820> want<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.030> do

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
I try to bypass that I didn't want to do

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.330 
I try to bypass that I didn't want to do
that<00:05:38.210> because<00:05:38.510> my<00:05:38.870> other<00:05:39.440> amp<00:05:39.890> is<00:05:40.040> a<00:05:40.070> little

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
that because my other amp is a little

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.890 
that because my other amp is a little
smaller<00:05:40.730> so<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.180> sounds<00:05:41.480> better<00:05:41.630> coming

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
smaller so it sounds better coming

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.440 
smaller so it sounds better coming

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
and this will be over here so it'll make

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.290 
and this will be over here so it'll make
a<00:07:35.900> lot<00:07:36.139> of<00:07:36.169> sense<00:07:36.440> and<00:07:36.710> will<00:07:36.800> be<00:07:36.919> a<00:07:36.949> lot<00:07:37.159> easier
