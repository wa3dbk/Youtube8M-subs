LATTE ART

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:27.900
Now we are getting to latte art - the decorative design of the surface of espresso-based beverages with milk.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:42.180
It's all about pouring in the milk in a special way, so that the milk and the espresso get combined and I can design the milk’s surface.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.800
Thereby it is very important to use the fine-pored milk foam. I just showed you how to do the foaming.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.200
Also it is important to use a pot with a sharp spout in order to dose the milk stream in the right way.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.940
It is crucial to have the right dosage, which I am going to show you straight away.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.820
Don’t pour in too slowly! In that way only the milk gets into the cup whereas the foam remains in the pot.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.220
Thus, a certain speed has to be achieved.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.860
However don’t be too fast either! In that way the “painting” on the foam won’t be possible.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.720
Now I am going to show to you how the whole process works:

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.000
I start by pouring slowly into the central lower part of the espresso.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.480
It should be a slow and constant stream of milk.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.080
As soon as the cup is half full I increase the speed and lift the pot a little bit.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.680
The form of a heart gets visible and by moving to the other side the final basic form of a heart is created.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.360
As an easy variation on the basic heart you can also create the following form:

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.000
First pour in the milk like before and when half the cup is filled move the pot carefully

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.580
carefully from side to side and finally pull it through like this to create a rosette-like heart.
