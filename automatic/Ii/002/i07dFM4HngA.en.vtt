 report of Lebanese re mien muriel 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.570
 active woman and mother of three 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 complaining about his nails not always very 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 pretty 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.310
 as for mickaël his younger son they 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 gnawing like all of us muriel 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.350
 and his son put their nails to rough 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.790
 test 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 that's what our 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.810
 beautician aude landry so what 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.810
 what's wrong with your hands muriel 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.810
 according to you then I'm right that they are 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.090
 a little damaged that doubles up then I 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.040
 have kiska wireless and limit costs 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.850
 then not happy or not at all 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.590
 only a high customer goes all 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.490
 first observed muriel in his life 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.200
 daily 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 like many women she does the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.399
 cleaning and dishes without gloves is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 pity you do not wear gloves 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.909
 muriel because the prolonged moisture in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 done on your nails 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 it's going to soften them so they 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.609
 are going to be more fragile and they are going 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.049
 break the nail easily 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.399
 itself is solid these are our 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.259
 daily activities that the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.950
 weaken as confirmed by the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.000
 dermatologist 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.530
 hervé degas often intrinsically 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.910
 it's a pretty healthy time 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.340
 it is very rare to have deficiencies 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.260
 nutritional or vitamin inducing 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.130
 a fragility of water except maybe 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.670
 iron deficiency 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.690
 so most often it's the fact of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.430
 soak your hands in 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.460
 water to use costil products and 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.100
 too aggressive tableware products that 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.660
 will weaken long for good 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.420
 understand the effect of water let's see 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.460
 first what a nail it is based on 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.229
 what is called the flesh bed that 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.450
 we see in transparency and who 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.940
 gives its pink color and the nail takes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 root here the white that we see at 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.110
 its base is the lunula the part 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.980
 apparent from the root tip of the nail 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.130
 called free edge 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.720
 it's all that goes beyond the finger if 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.670
 the nail is so sensitive to water it's 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.560
 because it's made up of keratin one 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 very porous protein that is going to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.050
 behave a bit like this piece of 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.520
 wood 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.530
 when we plunge him into the water he 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.480
 absorbs liquid for proof the level 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.760
 of water drops at full speed the bushel 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.350
 softened and becomes brittle exactly 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.950
 like your nails when you do the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.510
 crockery second aggression shocks 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.989
 that you inflict them throughout 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.510
 the day 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.030
 the only way to protect them apply 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.290
 a shock varnish 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.580
 it is first of all the green we who will 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.709
 take and pasta so it's a 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.930
 small protection tool and varnish 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.640
 protects indeed shocks but also 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.690
 water the proof with this new 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.250
 experience 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.290
 find our piece of wood that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.360
 this time we're going to varnish and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.620
 watch after letting it soak 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.959
 in the water for three hours 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.420
 the water level remain intact the wood 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.340
 did not absorb anything the polish did 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.950
 dam is exactly the same thing 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.220
 only on your nails stop with your 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 fingers 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.620
 and here is the third source of aggression 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.280
 onychophagia, in other words, biting 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.260
 nails 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.870
 one in three French people would suffer from this 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 toc then little trick when you look 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.440
 the TV just you take a 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.510
 object on which you are going to divert his 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.310
 watch out for a little ball 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.959
 anti stress or your bunch of keys and 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.910
 you touch them go back in all 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.380
 the senses it will avoid your fingers 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.480
 in talent and for women 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.650
 there is a radical way to hide 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.959
 damaged nails 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.239
 it is the laying of false nails first 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.170
 method the plastic capsules 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.730
 commercially available for 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.500
 a few euros they are easy to 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.750
 ask with a single dot of glue that 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.700
 removes solvent but beware they 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.770
 should not be kept more than 48 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.940
 hours explanations al plastic or the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.560
 problematic glue that will be 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.569
 dangerous it's mostly the way the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.220
 version is on nail so there we 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.870
 sees that the capsule is already lifting 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.790
 has not put enough school question 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.500
 did not dice one of the natural rays and there 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.440
 we have a risk of infiltration of others 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.269
 or germs of germs and 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.980
 proliferation and appearances nico other 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.480
 problem when these capsules are 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.610
 worn too long they can 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.349
 adhere to longued the embrittle then 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.250
 for a prosthesis perfectly adapted to 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.470
 your morphology 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.280
 opt for filling fashioned on 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.460
 the natural nail 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.160
 jessica will test the gel uv and cathy the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.750
 resin started to make resin 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.669
 we mix a plastic powder and 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.710
 from acrylic to a shaping liquid 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.620
 to give it the consistency of a gel 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.780
 we will ask the reason directly on 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.490
 the angle for that the prosthesis is place 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.409
 a paper guardian at the end of 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.320
 nail this scale ranging from 1 to 5 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.349
 allows to define the desired length 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.210
 when we work on form we put the 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.590
 much less invasive resin 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.810
 we did not go through the system of 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.520
 capture with glue the application has to 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.599
 to be done quickly because the resin dries 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.220
 and hardens quickly 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.960
 then just the file and the 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.030
 ends to give it the shape of a 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.010
 nail the resin seems to be one with 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.229
 the natural nails of cathy a 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.660
 very special feeling magazine is 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.920
 a very very old material so 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.120
 really have the feeling of having 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.800
 something strange and on his 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.690
 fingers but she'll also have 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.400
 the impression of a solidity a matter 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.890
 very resistant but which has a 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.720
 aesthetic disadvantage she yellows with 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.190
 the time the resin and son matter more 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.730
 porous go much more sensitive to 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.440
 assault 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.910
 it is in contact with the light that she 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.370
 deteriorates as this proves 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.440
 experience we placed a stick of 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.330
 resin 20 hours under a UV lamp and 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.030
 look at the result the resin has 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.980
 considerably yellow in order to hide 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.900
 this effect must imperatively 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.810
 wear a varnish of color on the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.670
 resin nails to prevent this 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.320
 annoyance jessica chose another 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.240
 formula the UV gel 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.740
 it is also composed of acrylic and 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.690
 its method of application is the same 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.760
 so the gel is a product that is 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.580
 very late in his point we will 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.090
 apply it on the nail make it harden 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.000
 under the inked 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.100
 and yes because unlike the resin it 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.470
 needs his rays to harden and he 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.170
 does not jaunit rappaz other advantage it is 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.620
 much more flexible and not sensible nor 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.750
 rHONE 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.120
 we know very very good level is very 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.470
 natural only downside the uv gel is 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.330
 much more sensitive to shocks 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.920
 if you are a woman active resin 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.200
 is better because it is stronger 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.670
 but for all these methods a fitting 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.380
 is required every three weeks 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.940
 you now have all the keys 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.940
 to be beautiful to the tips of your nails
