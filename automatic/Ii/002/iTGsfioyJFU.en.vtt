00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
teams that we played you know I probably

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
played again sir I've seen me so they

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
played again sir I've seen me so they
know<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> threat<00:01:13.680> down

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
know that you know we have a threat down

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.590

the<00:01:14.460> field<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> yeah<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.390> eventually

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the field and yeah I think eventually

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.760 
the field and yeah I think eventually
that<00:01:16.229> would<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.770> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
that would be something you know to to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.300 
that would be something you know to to
keep<00:01:19.950> them<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.909> their<00:01:21.210> heels<00:01:21.390> but

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
keep them you know on their heels but

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
keep them you know on their heels but
