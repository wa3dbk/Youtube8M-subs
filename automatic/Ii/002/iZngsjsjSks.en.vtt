00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:40.670
 on the opposite side, nothing below 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.899
 We have to recharge the phone transfer 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.659

 book last typed missed 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.290
 numbers and the like, and then here we are 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.120

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.970
 app control belt 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.410
 Phone settings 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.810
 this click on it you can see that you can 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.470
 wireless networking tab calls sound 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 screen and so on if we go to 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.560
 these buttons are here home button here

 button to return the action that you have 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.380
 was want on action back let's say 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:17.079
 this search button that's all here too 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.769

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.780
 desktops of your smartphone i'm her 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.890
 disabled them not enough 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.230
 it seemed uncomfortable as a classic 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.830
 standard option when switching 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.390
 between the tables or not so pro 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.160
 This phone can impress 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 tell about the smartphone and many wrote 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.270
 that he can spontaneous phone 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.860
 quite often reboot either 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.660
 shut down go to sleep 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.850
 either discharged i don't know my not 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.010
 faced for three months of use 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.810
 I have it once he crashes on 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.739
 for unknown reasons, turned off and on again 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.410
 hangup either some 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.150
 brakes vlohov name as you like 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:10.700
 I did not notice the jargon with their words 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:14.209
 enough the app is playing does not work 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.160
 smartly I don't ship him games 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.570
 yes here and what games can be serious 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.310
 enable yourself understand wai-fay only 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.830
 use for downloading from play 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.790
 Market any installation apps 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.010
 also from this smartphone I did 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.020
 some review available on my 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.830
 channel including applications 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.280
 installed on android smartphones 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.200
 android phone call whatever you like 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.780
 Basically, this is about rebooting. 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.760
 its either off relative in 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.010
 shape pour into it such round edges 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.210
 slanted and some wrote that he 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.890
 somehow unreliable sitting in hand is 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.630
 what sometimes pops up really 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.680
 I then less 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.330
 and his fate support that when 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.940
 holding a phone wanda you take them 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.100
 somehow slips out of my hands 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.470
 only in the liver and developed 2 times 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.440
 in the search it seems to seem like he can 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.660
 speak out but it did 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.270
 what else can I say about the photo and 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.700
 video cameras but here stated 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.610
 permission is now milds 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:29.830
 let's see the resolution of this smartphone 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:35.990
 we include all characteristics of pictures we look for 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.510
 5 megapixels 2,592 by 1944 indulging 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.570
 I want to say that here is the camera 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.090
 takes off in my mind mediocre me and 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.270
 chose not to use 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.720
 camera soap box for photographing 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.250
 some a4 documents in order 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.200
 so that you can then transfer to 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.350
 laptop on computers to see already 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.010
 he copes with this task in principle 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:04.100
 okay but for example i have a photo 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:07.010
 soap dish canon which is 5 megapixels 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.110
 a long time ago bought years eight volumes 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.570
 pictures do much better than this 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.700
 phone 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.460
 but this is not the essence of a4 format 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.370
 can do with him some other no 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.410
 not really 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.290
 camera photos do i would say 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.370
 quite mediocre camcorder 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:32.030
 here it is stated 1280 to 720 that is 720p 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.020
 quality seems to be born leaves 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.230
 want something better 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.150
 because this is a video camera which 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.690
 here has she removes that if you 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.970
 will start 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.000
 Here is the video camera on the smartphone 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.980
 enter side aside either 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.350
 the frame will be some kind of dynamic objects 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.050
 moving then you will see what it takes 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.880
 a very bad number appears definitely 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.190
 image clarity is a minus 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.790
 of course let's see video cameras 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.350
 here nayl we activate on video cameras 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.390
 There are certain settings that are 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:09.620
 standard effects you can 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:12.500
 apply auto glow lamp by me 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.600
 the light here flash is on either 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:19.340
 off and here quality 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.440
 video images high low here 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.880
 the cameras will work back frontally 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.370
 can be transferred to the section dedicated 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.920
 the camera has certain settings here 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.500
 which in principle are duplicated 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.480
 like a camcorder but plus certain it 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.540
 as far as I understand you can bring those 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.450
 objects that you shoot but in 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.190
 In principle, everything is in brief about this smartphone 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.280
 I want to say that his money is very 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:50.170
 justify buying it 4 500 years 4 600 and 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.090
 and even less than 4 300 works with a bang 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.310
 any significant flaws i 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.470
 I want to say significant shortcomings 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.900
 which answer him technical 

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:03.230
 I did not notice the characteristics so who 

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.700
 wants an inexpensive smartphone within 4 5 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.010
 thousand that is at least very 

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.010
 good offer good choice
