00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
found that the current certification

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.090 
found that the current certification
path<00:00:52.370> doesn't<00:00:52.850> have<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.660> basics<00:00:54.140> how<00:00:54.680> am<00:00:54.949> I

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
path doesn't have the basics how am I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.000 
path doesn't have the basics how am I
supposed<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.789> teach<00:00:56.149> kids<00:00:56.379> at<00:00:57.379> this<00:00:57.679> level

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
supposed to teach kids at this level

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.490 
supposed to teach kids at this level
when<00:00:58.820> they<00:00:59.030> don't<00:00:59.179> really<00:00:59.629> know<00:00:59.840> what<00:01:00.170> server

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
when they don't really know what server

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.590 
when they don't really know what server
permissions<00:01:01.160> are<00:01:01.429> and<00:01:01.730> they<00:01:02.149> don't<00:01:02.300> really

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
permissions are and they don't really

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.700 
permissions are and they don't really
know<00:01:02.960> how<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.350> deal<00:01:03.679> with<00:01:03.710> users<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.120> MTA

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
know how to deal with users the MTA

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.280 
know how to deal with users the MTA
certainly<00:01:06.710> gives<00:01:07.250> kids<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:08.290> fundamentals

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
certainly gives kids the fundamentals

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.590 
certainly gives kids the fundamentals
and<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.590> foundation<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.520> they<00:01:10.760> need<00:01:11.060> for<00:01:11.420> me

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
and the foundation that they need for me

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.200 
and the foundation that they need for me
to<00:01:11.870> build<00:01:12.080> upon<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.520> want<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:13.820> think<00:01:14.060> of

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
to build upon then we want to think of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.570 
to build upon then we want to think of
what<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.630> user<00:01:14.870> did<00:01:15.260> in<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.530> last<00:01:15.740> week<00:01:16.280> what

MCTS<00:01:37.250> basically<00:01:38.120> we<00:01:38.450> began<00:01:38.750> by<00:01:38.810> looking<00:01:39.320> at

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
MCTS basically we began by looking at

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.750 
MCTS basically we began by looking at
the<00:01:39.680> curriculum<00:01:39.800> looking<00:01:40.220> at<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.400> sort<00:01:40.700> of

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
the curriculum looking at the sort of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
the curriculum looking at the sort of
core<00:01:40.880> curriculum<00:01:41.150> in<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.390> Microsoft

official<00:01:42.140> curriculum<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.010> deciding<00:01:43.490> what

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
official curriculum and deciding what

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.460 
official curriculum and deciding what
route<00:01:44.150> we<00:01:44.300> wanted<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.540> take<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.050> then<00:01:45.380> we

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
route we wanted to take and then we

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.320 
route we wanted to take and then we
decided<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:46.610> also<00:01:46.760> needed<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.180> give

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
decided that we also needed to give

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.780 
decided that we also needed to give
students<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.960> way<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.290> test<00:01:48.830> before<00:01:49.520> they<00:01:49.640> took

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
students a way to test before they took

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.490 
students a way to test before they took
the<00:01:49.970> official<00:01:50.330> test<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.960> what<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:51.320> found

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the official test and what we found

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.720 
the official test and what we found
there<00:01:51.650> was<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.040> measure<00:01:52.280> up<00:01:52.490> was<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
there was that measure up was the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.610 
there was that measure up was the
perfect<00:01:52.910> solution<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.630> kids<00:01:54.290> love

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
perfect solution for that kids love

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
such a strong foundation and technology

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.240 
such a strong foundation and technology
and<00:02:43.049> we<00:02:43.260> want<00:02:43.439> to<00:02:43.530> get<00:02:43.620> into<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.129> they

and we want to get into it but they

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.009 
and we want to get into it but they
don't<00:02:44.609> quite<00:02:44.849> know<00:02:44.939> how<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.389> get<00:02:45.629> into<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
don't quite know how to get into it

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.750 
don't quite know how to get into it
there's<00:02:46.409> so<00:02:46.500> much<00:02:46.620> information<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.370> it's

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
there's so much information that it's

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.970 
there's so much information that it's
kind<00:02:47.939> of<00:02:47.970> overwhelming<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.139> to<00:02:49.409> put<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.769> into

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
kind of overwhelming so to put that into

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.940 
kind of overwhelming so to put that into
a<00:02:50.159> course<00:02:50.549> that's<00:02:51.450> simpler<00:02:52.139> and<00:02:52.349> provides<00:02:52.769> a

a course that's simpler and provides a
strong<00:02:53.280> foundation<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:54.060> think<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.659> lot

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
