00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
do you just to try to tighten up the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
do you just to try to tighten up the
lower<00:00:26.460> part<00:00:26.669> of<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.789> face<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.509> have<00:00:27.689> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.740 

I've<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.220> had<00:00:35.310> any<00:00:35.370> surgery<00:00:35.940> done<00:00:36.150> but<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.540> have

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
I've not had any surgery done but I have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
I've not had any surgery done but I have
done<00:00:36.960> chemical<00:00:37.410> peels<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:38.010> other<00:00:38.130> things<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
done chemical peels and other things to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.310 
done chemical peels and other things to
help<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.879> texture<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.539> tone<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:39.899> skin

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
help with texture and tone of my skin

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260 
help with texture and tone of my skin
yeah<00:00:40.469> your<00:00:40.649> skin<00:00:40.829> looks<00:00:41.010> good<00:00:41.219> okay<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:42.210> do

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
yeah your skin looks good okay what do

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.819 
yeah your skin looks good okay what do
we<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> lean<00:00:43.020> back<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.620> little

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we do have you lean back just a little

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
we do have you lean back just a little
bit<00:00:43.949> I'm<00:00:44.609> gonna<00:00:44.789> pilo<00:00:45.149> ultrasound<00:00:45.690> gel<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.199> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
bit I'm gonna pilo ultrasound gel so the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.259 
bit I'm gonna pilo ultrasound gel so the
idea<00:00:46.590> behind<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.219> fracked<00:00:47.460> aura<00:00:47.699> is<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
idea behind the fracked aura is it's a

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.540 
idea behind the fracked aura is it's a
radio<00:00:48.690> frequency<00:00:49.019> device<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.519> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
radio frequency device and it's not a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
radio frequency device and it's not a
laser<00:00:50.850> meaning<00:00:51.269> we<00:00:51.359> don't<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> wear<00:00:52.010> any

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
laser meaning we don't have to wear any

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.970 
laser meaning we don't have to wear any
ice<00:00:53.850> shielding<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.600> anything<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:55.019> that<00:00:55.079> but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
ice shielding or anything like that but

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
ice shielding or anything like that but
what<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> does<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.730> creates<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.210> deep

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
what it does is it creates some deep

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
what it does is it creates some deep
heating<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:57.989> skin<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> idea<00:00:59.100> behind

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
heating of the skin and the idea behind

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.150 
heating of the skin and the idea behind
all<00:00:59.640> lasers<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:00.690> heat<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> skin<00:01:01.260> up

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
all lasers is that they heat the skin up

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.700 
all lasers is that they heat the skin up
to<00:01:02.219> try<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> tighten<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> skin

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to try to tighten it and when the skin

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.930 
to try to tighten it and when the skin
gets<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> certain<00:01:05.160> temperature<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
gets to a certain temperature and that

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.980 
gets to a certain temperature and that
temperature<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.480> about<00:01:06.890> 42<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.070> 43<00:01:08.400> degrees

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
temperature is about 42 to 43 degrees

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
temperature is about 42 to 43 degrees
Celsius<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.560> causes<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> skin<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> tighten<00:01:11.340> up

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
Celsius it causes the skin to tighten up

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
Celsius it causes the skin to tighten up
and<00:01:12.090> even<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> lifts<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:12.900> now<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.829> hear

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and even the lifts a bit now you hear

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
and even the lifts a bit now you hear
that<00:01:14.280> beeping<00:01:14.880> sound<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.360> beeping<00:01:15.630> sound<00:01:15.689> is

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that beeping sound that beeping sound is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.100 
that beeping sound that beeping sound is
telling<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.509> hot<00:01:18.509> her<00:01:18.689> skin<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
telling me just how hot her skin is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.330 
telling me just how hot her skin is
getting<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.590> we're<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.799> about<00:01:19.890> 30<00:01:20.280> degrees

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
getting and we're at about 30 degrees

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
getting and we're at about 30 degrees
right<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.479> quite<00:01:21.720> quite<00:01:22.680> there

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
right now so we're not quite quite there

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.639 
right now so we're not quite quite there
to<00:01:23.040> therapeutic<00:01:23.430> yet<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> about

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
to therapeutic yet so what is it about

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.710 
to therapeutic yet so what is it about
the<00:01:25.799> heat<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.460> causes<00:01:26.670> activity<00:01:27.390> among

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the heat it just causes activity among

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080 
the heat it just causes activity among
the<00:01:27.960> cells<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.829> grow<00:01:29.159> new<00:01:29.369> cells<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:29.970> something

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the cells to grow new cells or something

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
the cells to grow new cells or something
yeah<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.020> heat<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> collagen<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
yeah when you heat the collagen of the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.679 
yeah when you heat the collagen of the
skin<00:01:32.399> up<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> certain<00:01:32.939> temperature<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.420> 40

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
skin up to a certain temperature that 40

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.389 
skin up to a certain temperature that 40
to<00:01:33.810> 43<00:01:34.110> degrees<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.770> collagen<00:01:35.159> actually

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
to 43 degrees the collagen actually

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.580 
to 43 degrees the collagen actually
breaks<00:01:35.700> down<00:01:35.969> okay<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.600> when<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> collagen

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
breaks down okay and when the collagen

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
breaks down okay and when the collagen
reformulates<00:01:38.369> itself<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.000> reformulates

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
reformulates itself they reformulates

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
reformulates itself they reformulates
itself<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.170> tighter<00:01:40.469> patterns<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
itself into tighter patterns so the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
itself into tighter patterns so the
old-style<00:01:42.360> lasers<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> people

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
face get it to that temperature oh the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.380 
face get it to that temperature oh the
new<00:01:49.680> treatments<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.240> burn

the skin but we can still get the
temperature<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> therapeutic

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

tightening<00:01:54.689> level<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.409> Chris<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
feel anything just warmth this warm so

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.600 
feel anything just warmth this warm so
it<00:01:58.469> doesn't<00:01:58.710> hurt<00:01:58.860> No

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
it doesn't hurt No

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.779 
it doesn't hurt No
very<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.350> how<00:02:01.979> often<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
very so you would do this how often and

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.450 
very so you would do this how often and
and<00:02:03.060> how<00:02:03.299> permanent<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> results<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.340> we

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and how permanent are the results so we

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.260 
and how permanent are the results so we
do<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.729> typically<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.420> once<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.409> week

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
do this typically is once a week

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.510 
do this typically is once a week
about<00:02:08.570> six<00:02:09.140> to<00:02:09.320> eight<00:02:09.350> weeks<00:02:09.470> for<00:02:10.070> maximum

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
about six to eight weeks for maximum

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.900 
about six to eight weeks for maximum
results<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:11.540> after<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:12.140> get<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
results then after that we get to a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.680 
results then after that we get to a
maintenance<00:02:13.910> treatment<00:02:14.300> where<00:02:14.420> it's<00:02:14.540> about

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
maintenance treatment where it's about

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.510 
maintenance treatment where it's about
quarterly<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.710> isn't<00:02:15.890> something<00:02:16.220> where

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
quarterly so this isn't something where

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.610 
quarterly so this isn't something where
you<00:02:16.640> do<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.990> years<00:02:18.200> later<00:02:18.440> you're

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
you do it and two years later you're

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.810 
you do it and two years later you're
gonna<00:02:18.710> still<00:02:19.010> have<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.280> result<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
gonna still have the result of a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.300 
gonna still have the result of a
treatment<00:02:20.060> two<00:02:20.420> years<00:02:20.630> before<00:02:20.810> okay<00:02:21.500> but<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
treatment two years before okay but it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.400 
treatment two years before okay but it
is<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.460> situation<00:02:22.760> where<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.020> you
