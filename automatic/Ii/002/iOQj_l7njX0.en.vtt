00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
training and then it was great to get

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.790 
training and then it was great to get
into<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> four-year<00:04:26.449> program<00:04:27.020> where<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.440> could

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
into a four-year program where I could

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.240 
into a four-year program where I could
continue<00:04:28.610> my<00:04:29.270> training<00:04:29.479> every<00:04:30.169> single<00:04:30.199> day<00:04:30.680> so

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
continue my training every single day so

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.320 
continue my training every single day so
I<00:04:31.639> loved<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.720> loved<00:04:33.020> being<00:04:33.550> submerged<00:04:34.550> into

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
I loved it I loved being submerged into

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.450 
I loved it I loved being submerged into
the<00:04:36.020> world<00:04:36.199> of<00:04:36.380> acting<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:37.039> singing<00:04:37.220> and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
the world of acting and singing and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.879 
the world of acting and singing and
dancing<00:04:37.550> every<00:04:38.510> single<00:04:38.810> day<00:04:38.900> uh<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.710> helped

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
dancing every single day uh it helped

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.200 
dancing every single day uh it helped
because<00:04:40.070> there<00:04:40.430> were<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:40.729> many<00:04:40.849> opportunities

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
because there were so many opportunities

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.439 
because there were so many opportunities
to<00:04:41.960> perform<00:04:42.409> it<00:04:42.919> made<00:04:43.430> me<00:04:43.610> realize<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.000> it

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
to perform it made me realize that it

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.260 
to perform it made me realize that it
was<00:04:44.690> possible<00:04:45.260> for<00:04:45.320> me<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.800> get<00:04:46.070> up<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.820> stage

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
was possible for me to get up on stage

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.500 
was possible for me to get up on stage
in<00:04:47.419> front<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:47.900> people<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.320> do<00:04:48.500> my<00:04:48.650> own<00:04:48.800> thing

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
that that could grow and we both you

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.100 
that that could grow and we both you
know<00:05:31.009> spend<00:05:31.280> time<00:05:31.449> applying<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.720> things<00:05:32.870> that

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
know spend time applying the things that

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.600 
know spend time applying the things that
we<00:05:33.199> the<00:05:33.409> fundamentals<00:05:34.039> that<00:05:34.220> we<00:05:34.310> learned<00:05:34.520> to

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
we the fundamentals that we learned to

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.939 
we the fundamentals that we learned to
the<00:05:34.699> musical<00:05:35.030> theater<00:05:35.300> center<00:05:35.569> into<00:05:36.349> our<00:05:36.680> art

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
the musical theater center into our art

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.379 
the musical theater center into our art
and<00:05:38.289> kept<00:05:39.289> kind<00:05:39.530> of<00:05:40.090> trying<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.210> hone<00:05:41.360> our

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
and kept kind of trying to hone our

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.270 
and kept kind of trying to hone our
technique<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:42.020> a<00:05:42.110> way<00:05:42.229> that<00:05:42.830> was<00:05:42.919> gonna<00:05:43.099> make

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
technique in a way that was gonna make

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.920 
technique in a way that was gonna make
it<00:05:43.430> possible<00:05:43.580> for<00:05:43.909> us<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.150> do<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.449> in<00:05:44.599> a<00:05:44.690> sort<00:05:44.840> of

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
it possible for us to do it in a sort of

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.930 
it possible for us to do it in a sort of
a<00:05:45.020> second<00:05:45.349> nature<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.949> know<00:05:46.370> sort<00:05:46.759> of<00:05:46.819> way

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
a second nature you know sort of way

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.790 
a second nature you know sort of way
because<00:05:47.750> when<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.930> comes<00:05:48.020> down<00:05:48.259> to<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:48.680> you

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
because when it comes down to it you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.070 
because when it comes down to it you
have<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.130> let<00:05:49.220> your<00:05:49.340> technique<00:05:49.729> go<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.300> just

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
have to let your technique go and just

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.080 
have to let your technique go and just
bring<00:05:51.349> what<00:05:51.590> you<00:05:51.740> have<00:05:52.090> about<00:05:53.090> your<00:05:53.210> technique

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
bring what you have about your technique

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.309 
bring what you have about your technique
and<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.180> only<00:05:56.360> way<00:05:56.539> you<00:05:56.599> can<00:05:56.810> do<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.110> is

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
and the only way you can do that is

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.950 
and the only way you can do that is
through<00:05:57.590> having<00:05:58.280> intensive<00:05:58.940> training<00:05:59.330> with

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
through having intensive training with

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.180 
through having intensive training with
people<00:06:00.289> that<00:06:00.380> you<00:06:00.470> trusted<00:06:00.949> who<00:06:01.069> are

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
people that you trusted who are

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
that's how lucky we are to have had MTC

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.670 
that's how lucky we are to have had MTC
to<00:06:06.199> have<00:06:06.320> had<00:06:06.560> that<00:06:06.770> opportunity<00:06:07.810> I'm<00:06:08.810> not<00:06:09.650> a

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
day goes by that I don't think about MTC

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.939 
day goes by that I don't think about MTC
I<00:06:16.310> mean<00:06:17.000> really<00:06:17.479> because<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:18.590> just<00:06:18.740> because
