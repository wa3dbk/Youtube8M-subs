Punch and we're recording our version of
a<00:00:07.620> new<00:00:08.010> level<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.610> Pantera<00:00:09.679> compilation

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.460 

we<00:00:23.910> were<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> couple<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.019> different

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
we were going to a couple of different

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
we were going to a couple of different
you<00:00:25.650> know<00:00:25.769> possibilities<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.029> figured

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
you know possibilities and we figured

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.029 
you know possibilities and we figured
like<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.750> know<00:00:27.840> cemetery<00:00:28.410> gates<00:00:28.650> all<00:00:28.890> those

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
like you know cemetery gates all those

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.980 
like you know cemetery gates all those
songs<00:00:29.220> would<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.429> very<00:00:29.730> obvious<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
songs would be very obvious kind of a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.049 
songs would be very obvious kind of a
choice<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.309> has<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.730> nice

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
choice or this one has a really nice

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.000 
choice or this one has a really nice
group<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.840> figured<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.559> gonna<00:00:34.680> fit

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
group so we figured this one gonna fit

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.040 
group so we figured this one gonna fit
you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.280> -<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.670> already<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> groove

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you know - you're already kind of groove

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
you know - you're already kind of groove
kind<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.829> style<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> talked<00:00:39.210> about

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
kind of style and when so I talked about

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
kind of style and when so I talked about
it<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.629> talked<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.960> obviously<00:00:40.230> bringing<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it we talked about obviously bringing it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
it we talked about obviously bringing it
down<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.550> that's<00:00:41.670> sort<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.090> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
down to because that's sort of what we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.569 
down to because that's sort of what we
do<00:00:42.450> already<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.140> has<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.530> pretty<00:00:43.920> big<00:00:44.070> nasty

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
do already it has a pretty big nasty

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.389 
do already it has a pretty big nasty
groove<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> add<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.320> low<00:00:46.920> heavy

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
groove you know you add that low heavy

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.979 
groove you know you add that low heavy
tuning<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.420> gonna<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.629> pretty

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
tuning to it and it's gonna be pretty

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.330 
tuning to it and it's gonna be pretty
nasty<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> idea

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.820 

yes<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:56.760> yep<00:00:57.760> now<00:00:58.120> it's<00:00:58.300> all<00:00:58.450> B's

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
Ontario is kind of homeland for us

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.730 
Ontario is kind of homeland for us
because<00:01:04.000> they<00:01:04.210> live<00:01:04.420> off<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.809> same<00:01:05.050> sort

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
because they live off of the same sort

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:14.280 
because they live off of the same sort
of<00:01:05.800> heavy<00:01:06.100> picked<00:01:06.490> grooves<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.180> know

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.060 

obviously<00:01:15.290> we're<00:01:15.409> gonna<00:01:15.500> have<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.800> remake

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070
