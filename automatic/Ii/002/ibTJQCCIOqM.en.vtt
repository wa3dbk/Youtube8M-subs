control<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:25.599> bottle<00:00:26.599> top<00:00:26.779> off<00:00:26.990> with<00:00:27.199> this

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
control the bottle top off with this

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.960 
control the bottle top off with this
unit<00:00:27.619> it's<00:00:27.769> just<00:00:27.920> pretty<00:00:28.130> much<00:00:28.220> plug<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.759> go

unit it's just pretty much plug and go
and<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:29.810> relies<00:00:30.080> on<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:31.339> probe<00:00:31.699> here<00:00:31.970> which

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
and it relies on this probe here which

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.690 
and it relies on this probe here which
is<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.300> air<00:00:32.689> pressurized<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.710> measures<00:00:34.160> the

is a air pressurized and measures the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.720 
is a air pressurized and measures the
level<00:00:35.030> of<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.110> water<00:00:36.260> has<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.770> drops<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.280> then

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
level of the water has it drops and then

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.350 
level of the water has it drops and then
will<00:00:38.270> trigger<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:39.520> pump<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:40.760> come<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:41.120> and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
will trigger the pump to come on and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.860 
will trigger the pump to come on and
refill<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.350> water<00:00:42.850> that<00:00:43.850> has<00:00:44.030> evaporated<00:00:44.330> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
tsunami auto top off system all I did

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.219 
tsunami auto top off system all I did
was<00:01:55.439> Joe<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.429> little<00:01:56.640> hole<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.420> jug<00:01:57.960> there

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
was Joe a little hole in the jug there

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
was Joe a little hole in the jug there
and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:59.960> placed<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> lion<00:02:01.350> inside<00:02:01.939> but<00:02:02.939> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and then placed the lion inside but you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.149 
and then placed the lion inside but you
should<00:02:03.720> probably<00:02:04.020> consider<00:02:04.200> doing<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
should probably consider doing is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
should probably consider doing is
because<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> line<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.360> flimsy<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:07.229> won't<00:02:07.439> go

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
because the line so flimsy it won't go

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
because the line so flimsy it won't go
all<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> bottom<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:09.179> went<00:02:09.720> ahead

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
all the way to the bottom I went ahead

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.490 
all the way to the bottom I went ahead
and<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.110> tied<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> piece<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:12.019> dry<00:02:13.019> rock<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
and just tied a piece of dry rock to it
and<00:02:13.819> use<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.849> as<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> water<00:02:15.390> weight<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:16.349> keep

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and use that as a water weight to keep

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.729 
and use that as a water weight to keep
it<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.880> gonna<00:02:21.180> stop<00:02:21.450> here

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.800 

that's<00:02:26.250> where<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.519> tsunami<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.420> back

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that's where the tsunami is way back

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.550 
that's where the tsunami is way back
there

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
there

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.550 
there
see<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.190> am

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.759 

so<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.530 

pump<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.430> any<00:02:37.579> plugged<00:02:37.879> into<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
pump is any plugged into the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.959 
pump is any plugged into the
tsunami<00:02:40.409> that's<00:02:41.069> what<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> plug<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.790> there

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
tsunami that's what the plug is there

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.360 
tsunami that's what the plug is there
it's<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.689> the<00:02:42.810> pump

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it's to the pump

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.550 
it's to the pump
and<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.819> tsunami<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.660> plugged<00:02:44.959> into<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.379> reef

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
and the tsunami is plugged into the reef

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.000 
and the tsunami is plugged into the reef
keeper<00:02:46.510> one<00:02:47.510> thing<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.750> did<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.019> mention<00:02:48.080> is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
keeper one thing I did not mention is

keeper one thing I did not mention is
you<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.849> reef<00:02:50.120> keeper<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.959> an<00:02:51.379> SL

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
you if you have a reef keeper and an SL

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.290 
you if you have a reef keeper and an SL
one<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:53.030> don't<00:02:53.180> really<00:02:53.330> need<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:54.800> buy<00:02:55.060> an<00:02:56.060> auto

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
one you don't really need to buy an auto

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.000 
one you don't really need to buy an auto
top<00:02:56.569> off<00:02:56.780> because<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.170> SL<00:02:57.440> want<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.830> that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
top off because it SL want to do that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.309 
top off because it SL want to do that
for<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.459> but<00:02:59.360> because<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.989> particular

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
for you but because this particular

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.050 
for you but because this particular
model<00:03:00.680> has<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:02.060> pressurized<00:03:02.959> air<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.790> measure

model has the pressurized air to measure
the<00:03:05.510> water<00:03:06.080> volume<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:07.250> why<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.489> went<00:03:07.700> ahead

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
the water volume that's why I went ahead

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.970 
the water volume that's why I went ahead
and<00:03:07.940> bought<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.390> one<00:03:08.450> because<00:03:09.319> with<00:03:09.860> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
and bought this one because with the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.740 
and bought this one because with the
float<00:03:10.220> switches<00:03:10.879> they<00:03:11.299> tend<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.629> have

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
float switches they tend to have

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.600 
float switches they tend to have
problems<00:03:12.549> getting<00:03:13.549> stuck<00:03:13.879> long<00:03:14.060> as<00:03:14.239> well<00:03:15.610> you

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
problems getting stuck long as well you

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.039 
problems getting stuck long as well you
could<00:03:16.790> see<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:18.430> probe<00:03:19.430> for<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.150> tsunami<00:03:20.690> I

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
could see the probe for the tsunami I

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:28.089 
could see the probe for the tsunami I
placed<00:03:21.980> against<00:03:22.579> just<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.480> standard<00:03:27.099> glass

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
placed against just a standard glass

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.729 
placed against just a standard glass
cleaner<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.700> magnet<00:03:29.209> glass<00:03:29.450> cleaner<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.989> then

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
cleaner a magnet glass cleaner and then

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.330 
cleaner a magnet glass cleaner and then
use<00:03:31.720> zip<00:03:32.720> ties<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.379> place<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.829> on<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.129> glass

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
use zip ties to place it on the glass

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.770 
use zip ties to place it on the glass
cleaner<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:36.819> probe<00:03:37.819> comes<00:03:38.150> with<00:03:38.799> some

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
cleaner the probe comes with some

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.550 
cleaner the probe comes with some
suction<00:03:41.780> cups

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
suction cups

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.220 
suction cups
however<00:03:43.400> those<00:03:43.519> suction<00:03:43.910> cups<00:03:44.180> can<00:03:44.450> fail<00:03:44.959> and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
however those suction cups can fail and

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.660 
however those suction cups can fail and
if<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.620> float<00:03:45.860> switch<00:03:46.160> starts<00:03:46.459> floating

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
if that float switch starts floating

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.340 
if that float switch starts floating
around<00:03:46.849> you're<00:03:47.090> gonna<00:03:47.180> have<00:03:47.329> problems<00:03:47.600> so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
around you're gonna have problems so

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.960 
around you're gonna have problems so
just<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.620> make<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.799> more<00:03:49.010> secure<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.430> put<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.790> on

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
just to make it more secure I put it on

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.400 
just to make it more secure I put it on
this<00:03:50.540> glass<00:03:50.840> cleaner<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:53.290> zip-tied<00:03:54.290> it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
this glass cleaner and zip-tied it

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.619 
this glass cleaner and zip-tied it
together

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.589 

so<00:03:59.140> I'll<00:03:59.230> go<00:03:59.349> ahead<00:03:59.439> and<00:03:59.650> do<00:03:59.769> a<00:04:00.599> demonstration

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
so I'll go ahead and do a demonstration

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.300 
so I'll go ahead and do a demonstration
of<00:04:01.810> how<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:01.989> works<00:04:02.230> what<00:04:02.829> I'm<00:04:02.889> gonna<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.129> now<00:04:03.280> is

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
of how it works what I'm gonna do now is

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.849 
of how it works what I'm gonna do now is
do<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.609> demonstration<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.569> how<00:04:04.659> this<00:04:05.379> auto<00:04:05.590> top

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
do a demonstration on how this auto top

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.879 
do a demonstration on how this auto top
off<00:04:06.010> works<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:08.290> theory

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
off works in theory

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.839 
off works in theory
I<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:11.379> waterline<00:04:11.829> marked<00:04:12.129> off<00:04:12.280> there<00:04:12.609> so

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
I have the waterline marked off there so

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.910 
I have the waterline marked off there so
we<00:04:13.209> can<00:04:13.389> see<00:04:13.659> how<00:04:13.840> much<00:04:14.019> water<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.469> coming<00:04:14.680> out

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
we can see how much water is coming out

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.789 
we can see how much water is coming out
I<00:04:15.780> have<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.959> jug<00:04:17.199> that's<00:04:17.380> gonna<00:04:17.590> be

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
I have the jug that's gonna be

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.589 
I have the jug that's gonna be
collecting<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.639> water<00:04:18.880> coming<00:04:19.150> out<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.509> the

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
collecting the water coming out of the

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:25.170 
collecting the water coming out of the
tank<00:04:19.979> marked<00:04:21.150> by<00:04:22.150> gallons<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.380> then<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.550> auto

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
tank marked by gallons and then the auto

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.180 
tank marked by gallons and then the auto
top<00:04:25.509> off<00:04:25.690> water<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.169> filled<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.919> five

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
top off water is filled to the five

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.110 
top off water is filled to the five
gallon<00:04:27.400> mark<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:29.620> I'll<00:04:29.770> go<00:04:29.919> ahead<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.250> pull

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
gallon mark so I'll go ahead and pull

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.210 
gallon mark so I'll go ahead and pull
some<00:04:31.300> water<00:04:31.449> out<00:04:31.539> and<00:04:31.870> see<00:04:32.169> when<00:04:32.349> that<00:04:32.500> auto

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
some water out and see when that auto

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.089 
some water out and see when that auto
top<00:04:33.490> off<00:04:33.669> kicks<00:04:33.970> off<00:04:34.120> all<00:04:34.930> right<00:04:35.050> we<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
top off kicks off all right we have the

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.779 
top off kicks off all right we have the
auto<00:04:36.370> top<00:04:36.669> off<00:04:36.880> now<00:04:37.180> running<00:04:37.570> gives<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.349> the

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
auto top off now running gives you the

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:46.159 
auto top off now running gives you the
hairline<00:04:39.789> rose<00:04:41.400> water<00:04:44.520> took<00:04:45.520> out

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
hairline rose water took out

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.560 
hairline rose water took out
approximately<00:04:47.190> 1<00:04:48.190> gallon<00:04:48.460> before<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.330> auto

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
approximately 1 gallon before the auto

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.270 
approximately 1 gallon before the auto
top<00:04:49.900> off<00:04:50.430> kicked<00:04:51.430> on<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:53.199> 1<00:04:53.410> gallon<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.009> about

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
top off kicked on so 1 gallon and about

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.180 
top off kicked on so 1 gallon and about
a<00:04:54.669> hundred<00:04:55.360> gallon<00:04:55.900> system<00:04:58.440> sounds<00:04:59.440> about<00:05:00.039> to

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
a hundred gallon system sounds about to

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.270 
a hundred gallon system sounds about to
be<00:05:00.310> ok<00:05:00.759> I<00:05:01.090> know<00:05:01.750> there's<00:05:02.199> some<00:05:02.500> sensors<00:05:03.070> out

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
be ok I know there's some sensors out

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.420 
be ok I know there's some sensors out
there<00:05:03.310> that'll<00:05:04.139> immediately<00:05:05.139> pick<00:05:05.470> up<00:05:05.650> glory

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
there that'll immediately pick up glory

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.430 
there that'll immediately pick up glory
evaporation<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.479> start<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.930> water<00:05:08.169> back

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
evaporation and start to the water back

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.110 
evaporation and start to the water back
in<00:05:09.270> now<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.300> want<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.840> see<00:05:11.110> if<00:05:12.099> this<00:05:12.759> floats

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
in now I want to see if this floats

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.990 
in now I want to see if this floats
which<00:05:13.479> is<00:05:13.690> going<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.199> stop<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.680> water<00:05:14.919> at<00:05:15.729> the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
which is going to stop the water at the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.899 
which is going to stop the water at the
water<00:05:16.180> line<00:05:16.599> work<00:05:17.220> when<00:05:18.220> we<00:05:18.340> first<00:05:18.580> started

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
water line work when we first started

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.330 
water line work when we first started
the<00:05:19.000> water<00:05:19.270> was<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:20.199> above<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.889> water<00:05:21.070> line

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
the water was just above the water line

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.550 
the water was just above the water line
mark

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.840 

so<00:05:25.560> let's<00:05:25.710> see<00:05:25.830> if<00:05:25.920> it<00:05:26.010> gets<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.310> same<00:05:26.520> spot

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
so let's see if it gets the same spot

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.960 
so let's see if it gets the same spot
and<00:05:27.480> shut<00:05:28.170> itself<00:05:28.440> off<00:05:28.620> all<00:05:29.580> right<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:29.880> for

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
and shut itself off all right just for

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.490 
and shut itself off all right just for
the<00:05:30.060> purposes<00:05:30.450> of<00:05:30.510> not<00:05:30.780> screwing<00:05:31.200> around<00:05:31.260> with

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
the purposes of not screwing around with

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.010 
the purposes of not screwing around with
my<00:05:31.650> salinity<00:05:32.240> taking<00:05:33.240> out<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.390> gallon<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.870> water

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
my salinity taking out a gallon of water

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.560 
my salinity taking out a gallon of water
and<00:05:34.350> then<00:05:34.650> replace<00:05:35.490> him<00:05:35.670> gallon<00:05:36.240> water<00:05:36.330> with

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
and then replace him gallon water with

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.020 
and then replace him gallon water with
just<00:05:36.780> fresh<00:05:36.990> water<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.500> went<00:05:38.340> ahead<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.580> dumped

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
just fresh water I went ahead and dumped

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.620 
just fresh water I went ahead and dumped
out<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.540> water<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:41.010> siphoned<00:05:41.370> out<00:05:41.670> got

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
out the water that I siphoned out got

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.070 
out the water that I siphoned out got
the<00:05:42.750> water<00:05:42.990> line<00:05:43.260> right<00:05:43.290> exactly<00:05:44.010> back<00:05:44.310> to

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
the water line right exactly back to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.640 
the water line right exactly back to
where<00:05:46.080> we<00:05:46.200> started<00:05:46.530> from<00:05:46.590> and<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:48.660> auto<00:05:49.320> top

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
where we started from and the auto top

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.980 
where we started from and the auto top
off<00:05:49.830> shut<00:05:50.130> off<00:05:50.160> right<00:05:50.600> when<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:51.630> got<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.930> that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
off shut off right when I got to that

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.770 
off shut off right when I got to that
point<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:53.550> looks<00:05:53.850> like<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.300> part<00:05:54.540> of<00:05:54.600> its

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
point so it looks like that part of its

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.170 
point so it looks like that part of its
working<00:05:55.020> and<00:05:56.010> looks<00:05:56.190> like<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.520> auto<00:05:56.670> top<00:05:56.970> off

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
working and looks like the auto top off

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.780 
working and looks like the auto top off
will<00:05:57.540> kick<00:05:57.780> on<00:05:57.990> when<00:05:58.770> there's<00:05:58.980> about<00:05:59.220> three

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
will kick on when there's about three

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.550 
will kick on when there's about three
quarters<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.420> gallon<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.900> one<00:06:01.110> gallon<00:06:01.470> of

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
quarters of a gallon to one gallon of

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.120 
quarters of a gallon to one gallon of
water<00:06:01.940> without<00:06:02.940> grated<00:06:03.480> from<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:03.750> system<00:06:04.140> and

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
water without grated from the system and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.470 
water without grated from the system and
what's<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:07.190> emergency<00:06:08.190> overflow<00:06:08.790> arrives

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
what's the emergency overflow arrives

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.570 
what's the emergency overflow arrives
from<00:06:09.810> both<00:06:10.020> leaf<00:06:10.290> I'll<00:06:10.740> plug<00:06:11.010> that<00:06:11.130> into<00:06:11.370> that

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
from both leaf I'll plug that into that

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.650 
from both leaf I'll plug that into that
sl1<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.480> then<00:06:13.170> I'll<00:06:13.320> overfill<00:06:13.890> the<00:06:14.040> sump<00:06:14.310> and

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
sl1 and then I'll overfill the sump and

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.650 
sl1 and then I'll overfill the sump and
we'll<00:06:15.660> see<00:06:16.530> how<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:17.450> emergency<00:06:18.450> overflow

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
we'll see how the emergency overflow

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.200 
we'll see how the emergency overflow
works<00:06:18.990> on<00:06:19.170> the<00:06:19.260> system<00:06:19.790> okay<00:06:20.790> the<00:06:20.940> last<00:06:21.090> part

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
works on the system okay the last part

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.000 
works on the system okay the last part
of<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:21.540> auto<00:06:21.780> top<00:06:22.020> off<00:06:22.200> is<00:06:22.500> this<00:06:22.620> the

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
of the auto top off is this the

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.460 
of the auto top off is this the
emergency<00:06:23.190> float<00:06:23.670> switch<00:06:23.970> which<00:06:24.930> I<00:06:25.110> explained

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
emergency float switch which I explained

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.700 
emergency float switch which I explained
would<00:06:25.820> stop<00:06:26.820> the<00:06:27.120> auto<00:06:27.630> top<00:06:27.900> off<00:06:28.080> water<00:06:28.410> from

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
would stop the auto top off water from

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.140 
would stop the auto top off water from
running<00:06:28.830> into<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:29.250> sump<00:06:29.610> from<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:29.790> event

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
running into the sump from the event

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.760 
running into the sump from the event
that<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.570> pump<00:06:31.170> failed<00:06:32.130> and<00:06:32.490> was<00:06:32.670> stuck<00:06:32.910> on<00:06:33.770> so

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
that the pump failed and was stuck on so

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.860 
that the pump failed and was stuck on so
it's<00:06:34.890> just<00:06:35.010> a<00:06:35.250> security<00:06:36.060> measure<00:06:36.390> to<00:06:36.540> ensure

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
it's just a security measure to ensure

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.890 
it's just a security measure to ensure
that<00:06:36.900> on<00:06:37.200> I<00:06:37.410> don't<00:06:37.530> have<00:06:37.950> flooding<00:06:38.660> or<00:06:39.660> do<00:06:39.870> a

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
that on I don't have flooding or do a

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.660 
that on I don't have flooding or do a
little<00:06:40.080> quick<00:06:40.350> test<00:06:40.650> run<00:06:40.890> obviously<00:06:41.490> this

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
little quick test run obviously this

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.280 
little quick test run obviously this
float<00:06:41.970> switch<00:06:42.240> is<00:06:42.390> gonna<00:06:42.570> be<00:06:42.690> mounted<00:06:42.990> on<00:06:43.170> the

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
float switch is gonna be mounted on the

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.440 
float switch is gonna be mounted on the
inside<00:06:43.620> of<00:06:43.650> the<00:06:43.830> sump<00:06:44.100> on<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:44.490> outside<00:06:44.850> I<00:06:45.150> have

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
inside of the sump on the outside I have

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.150 
inside of the sump on the outside I have
it<00:06:45.600> on<00:06:45.690> the<00:06:45.840> outside<00:06:46.140> just<00:06:46.470> for<00:06:46.620> demonstration

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
it on the outside just for demonstration

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.310 
it on the outside just for demonstration
purposes<00:06:47.540> so<00:06:48.540> we'll<00:06:48.660> go<00:06:48.810> ahead<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.050> kick<00:06:49.170> off

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
purposes so we'll go ahead and kick off

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.890 
purposes so we'll go ahead and kick off
the<00:06:49.500> auto<00:06:49.680> top<00:06:49.980> off<00:06:50.390> the<00:06:51.390> water<00:06:51.600> is<00:06:51.750> now

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
the auto top off the water is now

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.750 
the auto top off the water is now
running<00:06:52.140> can<00:06:52.440> see<00:06:52.620> coming<00:06:52.860> out<00:06:53.010> of<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.250> air

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
running can see coming out of the air

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.390 
running can see coming out of the air
hose<00:06:54.000> and<00:06:54.680> now<00:06:55.680> we'll<00:06:55.950> say

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
hose and now we'll say
