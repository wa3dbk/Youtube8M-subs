I<00:00:57.800> was<00:00:58.039> very<00:00:58.190> cynical<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.300> do<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.629> course<00:01:00.199> I

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
I was very cynical to do this course I

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.650 
I was very cynical to do this course I
don't<00:01:00.530> like<00:01:00.710> role<00:01:00.949> play<00:01:01.370> didn't<00:01:02.090> like<00:01:02.210> any<00:01:02.420> non

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
don't like role play didn't like any non

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.680 
don't like role play didn't like any non
clinical<00:01:03.289> courses<00:01:03.800> really<00:01:04.039> but<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:04.879> think<00:01:05.270> it

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
clinical courses really but I think it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.139 
clinical courses really but I think it
just<00:01:05.990> changed<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.100> way<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.520> look<00:01:07.789> at<00:01:07.970> my

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
just changed the way of look at my

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.200 
just changed the way of look at my
practice<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:09.229> think<00:01:09.380> just<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.039> can<00:01:10.340> get<00:01:10.970> more

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
practice I think just you can get more

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.630 
practice I think just you can get more
acceptance<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.320> treatment<00:01:12.860> from<00:01:12.979> patients

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
acceptance to treatment from patients

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.870 
acceptance to treatment from patients
then<00:01:13.849> so<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.840> think<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.979> just<00:01:16.250> will<00:01:16.399> change<00:01:16.670> your

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
then so I think it just will change your

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.070 
then so I think it just will change your
life
