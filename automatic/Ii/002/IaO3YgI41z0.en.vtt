00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.719
 what is soccer 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.270
 football like that a boat we could soon 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.730
 say that soccer is a sport in the 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.039
 which 11 against 11 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.439
 they go after a ball and they have to 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.619
 put it inside some baskets that there 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.590
 at the sides there is a referee who manages 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.080
 the game the rules and then there are two 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.930
 coaches that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.630
 direct their players to have 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.630
 order and maintain a strategy and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.800
 at the beginning that's football but for 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.829
 what football really does soccer 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.449
 serves to control the social mass the 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.900
 football is a great medium and 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.070
 fantastic to have the town 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.760
 controlled its front elevation 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.090
 they give you some news that keeps you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.090
 there in the listening and they sell it to you as the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.900
 panacea of ​​fun and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.810
 entertainment and the end of a life or 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.750
 be to defend some colors of a team 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490
 that 's good that's super important and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.900
 that keeps us at odds with each other 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.450
 others because if you defend are the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.210
 colors there is always a very enemy 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.000
 usually near the nearest 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.420
 there can be if Real Madrid 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.369
 Atlético de Madrid is an enemy and for 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 Of course Barcelona yes to the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.700
 barcelona because Spanish is your great 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.369
 enemy at the same time as the real madrid that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.340
 it keeps us in a state of aggressiveness 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.500
 frustration because you do not always win 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.350
 team team sometimes loses with what 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 which maintains a state of anxiety 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.649
 maintains a state of little pacification 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.969
 of the body with which you will need 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.549
 medicines you will need, you will not be 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.909
 good with yourself because your team of 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.340
 your life that is your team and everything 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:05.720
 what you have then has lost and that hurts you 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.570
 and then when you go to the field 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.820
 christie are you creating anxiety so that 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.580
 your team score a goal which comes 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.250
 be a state of non-pacification of the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.540
 mind of harmony for that is the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460
 football in that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.100
 that's why they promote football so much 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.140
 That's what they pay those huge salaries to 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.230
 the soccer players why they keep it in 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.840
 the sports press is sinking so much 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.210
 that's why it's the business that's mounted 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 because it keeps us in a state of little 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.700
 health, which encourages us to 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.350
 consume more products to consume more 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.800
 drugs and go to the doctor in 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.050
 hospitals maintains a level of consumption 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.290
 and of expense and also does not maintain a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.170
 state of absolute absolute lack of 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.850
 conscience because because football is 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.010
 something that you can not control you are 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.040
 the second player say you are the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.760
 football animator are you what 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.590
 who is there cheering and but is not 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.329
 in the consciousness that is the energy 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.069
 we move the energy in the field 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.510
 of football if we agree in equal terms 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.879
 in the animal soccer field that was 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.019
 moving energy that we have to be more 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.220
 aware that we are 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.700
 able to move the energy of creating 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.900
 an energetic but clear movement of 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.040
 the way they are trying 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.500
 make understand the means of 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.770
 communication governments policies 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.820
 the general noel 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.980
 the information the multinationals all 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.630
 what the media all 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.790
 what they sell us is not to acquire 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.170
 awareness that we are capable 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.810
 to move the energy but what we 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.540
 transmit is the opposite and we 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.880
 encourage and encourage us to the contrary to 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.310
 that we are dependent on the system for 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.640
 that we are contributors to the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.920
 system continue to teach us to be 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.349
 dependents 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.250
 in the schools they do not inform us in the 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:08.370
 schools disinform doctrines create 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.650
 beings that in the end are going to be more 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.430
 that slaves who work for the 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:19.480
 system and live grow reproduce and 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.800
 die and follow the same process 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.860
 throughout life and soccer here 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.310
 plays an important role of domains 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.500
 of the mind with some genes that are the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.900
 that are of all kinds with those talk of 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.910
 his players is fantastic this player 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.280
 it's great that he surrounds our 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.120
 team as the opposing team gave 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.770
 have to lose such 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.710
 a joint podium towards a sector 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.660
 and something that links you to another sector 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.230
 at the same time it's called you want that state of 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.380
 aggressiveness 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.890
 and you keep that state of anxiety 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.639
 because if now for example the madrid 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.509
 wins the tenth European Cup 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.960
 Barcelona wins its fifth or sixth cup 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.960
 of Europe 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.400
 Well, next year will be the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.560
 same first and if the next one wins it 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.420
 the twelfth and there will be anxiety for 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.660
 win the thirteenth the following year 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.410
 and if he does not win it, there will be frustration and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.180
 there will be grief and the people will be 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.970
 he will feel bad because he will have won the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.650
 barcelona or will have won the Manchester or 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.130
 he will have won the bayern and he is the enemy 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:41.330
 of borussia to deserve manchester is 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.870
 the enemy of the chelsea and the and so not and 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.060
 so always every year is like never 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.430
 there is no end there is never a pacification 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.460
 Real succeeded never a one achievement 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.900
 it's only the next day and small 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.270
 period until the competition begins 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.240
 next where that 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:03.560
 anxiety and that need to win 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.849
 to get from 32 leagues 33 leagues 34 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.849
 lives and so not 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.930
 very little very little football contributes very 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:15.360
 little is really all thanks to the 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.509
 sophistication to which they have us in the 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.520
 that keep us and in that state of 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:24.479
 lethargy in which football is a big 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.599
 contributor to to create a fault 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.340
 of global consciousness because 11 22 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.030
 players there losing a little ball 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.650
 to put it in the party can not be 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.500
 of the most important things that happen 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.750
 in a country and that move a society not 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.759
 they should be it should not be 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.500
 we should be more aware and 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.490
 worry about things that are 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.650
 truly important 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.650
 up here thank you very much
