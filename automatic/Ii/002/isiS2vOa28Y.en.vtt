it right here right here and you know
this<00:02:25.700> part<00:02:25.970> should<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.239> right<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.930> you

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
this part should be right here so you

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:27.680

up and now it also comes with three

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.480 
up and now it also comes with three
different<00:02:33.120> coils<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.860> coils<00:02:35.370> are

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
different coils now the coils are

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.530 
different coils now the coils are
different<00:02:35.880> colors<00:02:36.330> are<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:37.800> pink<00:02:38.280> purple<00:02:38.940> and

green<00:02:40.130> colors<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:43.020> reason<00:02:43.440> why<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
green colors and the reason why is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470 
green colors and the reason why is
different<00:02:44.310> colors<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.850> because<00:02:45.270> there's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
different colors is because there's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.680 
different colors is because there's
different<00:02:45.870> types<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.680> pressures<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
different types of pressures you know so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.660 
different types of pressures you know so
like<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.350> beginning<00:02:49.560> pressure<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.430> different

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
like the beginning pressure is different

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.020 
like the beginning pressure is different
so<00:02:51.600> I'm<00:02:52.200> going<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:52.800> ahead<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.220> symbol<00:02:53.820> a
