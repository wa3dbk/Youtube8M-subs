00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.180
 hi good morning it is tuesday today 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.949
 Tuesday 2 June and today I am used to 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.890
 so a nice day at home at work 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.560
 I am going to do nice tutorials and filming as well 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 write some post and you it is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.259
 almost noon again 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 almost lunchtime even i have this morning 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.560
 also very briefly 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 worked behind the computer and through 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 answered so you can see what you have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.769
 I just showered and my hair is 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.870
 is still wet, I have to go straight away 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.640
 dry blow dry and well i have mine 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.559
 half of makeup already done because it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 is already in for tutorial I will only 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 the eye look has to do and it is one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.840
 a bit more intense and make-up 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 now at those moments eyebrows are wanting 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.230
 heavily set my foundation is just 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.309
 what thicker but good I do 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.280
 actually all it just for the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.640
 tutorial because or video then always falls 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.379
 something 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.820
 you do everything a little less so then I put 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.980
 so always be aware of your makeup 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 Just like that should it firmer 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.739
 today also not very nice weather 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.359
 so i am really very happy that i am 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.429
 no further and out the door 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.379
 so and yes today is just actually 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.480
 another day at home and copy it 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 like to enjoy watching 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.290
 I have also prepared everything to go 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.020
 filming and this time I decided to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 to sit in the bedroom and this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 is then actually the background you what 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 You always see that is actually 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.740
 we're just 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.960
 and I have some things are the way 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 pushed on the tables that you put that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.050
 Not a figurine that is your real ring 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.250
 who can see two lights 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.960
 but my room is fine too 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.400
 fully set yes the exposure 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 lamps that are really very many 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.120
 and then I actually always just go 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 Here comes in the middle of the bed 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.010
 sit and then yes then I go first my 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960
 tutorial take and this is the look I 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.550
 just recorded it is a what 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.040
 more intense happiness than what I normally always do 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.510
 but I had it all last week 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.430
 such nice packets received within 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.420
 with all my very nice bright summer 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.680
 colors 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 that I just had to do something with it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.720
 so I just really have a lot of blue 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.220
 used and also sea ​​green gold and I have 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.220
 I also have a kind of cut crease 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.190
 and and the tutorial are online 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.760
 at the moment and when I have this vlog online 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.890
 have standing 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.930
 so i will also go through that link below 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 in the description of this top note 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.330
 can be clicked sit you can right 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.860
 click through 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.299
 but I don't even have you either 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.650
 show what I'm actually wearing 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.879
 today so I'll go right now 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.250
 take a moment 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.920
 I am very honest that it is not that whole 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.290
 very special is yes now today because me 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.319
 I 'm just at home and my hair 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.140
 I also just kept quiet and me 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.090
 yes and just a white t-shirt fabric 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.739
 chasing something and it's from the front 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.540
 cotton with here 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.290
 side and rear is simply thiev 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.549
 the dust and I and you have worn out 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.230
 jeans and those of the mango with 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.469
 some worn spots and a bit 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.999
 washed out effect and just socks and 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.340
 and you that is actually my answer 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.749
 for today and I think I have more now 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.999
 went shopping because it is 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.620
 almost dinner time again and I had yesterday 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.200
 Missed a package so I'll go for it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.280
 pick up at the neighbors and yes that's what I am 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.379
 now go do it first 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.879
 I was just thinking and something and I have 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.519
 a little bit there too 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.810
 opinion about needed and because yes I have 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.269
 naturally this makeup look 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.069
 recorded and I want the door right now 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.060
 to pick up a package and to 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.450
 to do the groceries 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.519
 but i always feel like me 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.650
 with more make-up than I just have 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.420
 the door goes out that it is pretty strange 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.219
 is looked at from a supermarket 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.700
 then I see people really watching it 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.650
 everything has fake eyelashes us from this and yes 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.540
 I am very curious about you 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.849
 I just think that the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.989
 Dutch women on average 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.849
 probably just a mascara 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.829
 tje and lipglossje in a bag has 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.319
 and that is probably there for the 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.790
 So the rest of life does it so what 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.409
 do you have quite a lot 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.749
 make up or are you smarter too 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.040
 mascarat you about lip gloss i think it is 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.650
 actually very nice to know 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.870
 and what you think would be the financial 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.249
 most would come up with so many and 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.499
 makeup and especially now that I have this 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:54.299
 have done fake eyelashes or whatever you do 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.189
 would normally find is just so 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.989
 door is because I have really 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.719
 idea that it is less accepted 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.459
 here in the netherlands to get so much makeup 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.739
 so wear that I am curious about it 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.900
 because in principle I always love the 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.669
 ran errands will always do my 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.529
 fake eyelashes anyway and then I make 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.480
 it just a little more subtle 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.680
 because I and yes just every child's ideas 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.370
 that people are not so strange to me 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.290
 look 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.579
 and that yes, I think that's really bad 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.900
 sin because I am still very much 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.340
 done my best 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.989
 yes what would you do if you then 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.370
 go do the groceries and you have 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.780
 For example, net included a tutorial 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.310
 example inch as they are pretty good 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.930
 violent with fake eyelashes 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.150
 you would pick it now or it will 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.949
 then I am really sorry 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.960
 curious about it because I get 9 out of it 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.190
 the 10 times just really always what i am 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.479
 now go do it now i just enjoy it 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.650
 let it sit and I'll just go like this 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.449
 do the shopping 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.460
 I just got home from shopping 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.770
 and I am almost completely gone 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.720
 it is completely wet but I rain 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.460
 if is also pick up a package and the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.510
 to no makeup package or summer really 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.580
 something very big 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.919
 but I already know what's in it but me 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.449
 I haven't opened it yet I 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.919
 I've had it with scissors for a while 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.380
 go a bit so i 'm easy 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.750
 can immediately open it for you 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.130
 but I think what a lamp is because 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.770
 we have and presents lamps above the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.020
 dining table the one who now hangs that who 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.760
 we have yet to grant it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.789
 and that was actually more for nuts 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.410
 I don't quite like our taste so yes 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.820
 now we also have the lamps that we ordered 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.560
 have that he is very beautiful and that 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.630
 he once stands across the table i'm going now 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.340
 I finally have for you now 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.810
 opened up did not suppress me myself 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.520
 that I still just robbins help for 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.360
 I really need is gang striking 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.880
 really 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.620
 you have to go through the whole house i have to be here 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.080
 all still but it can also me 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.960
 got that very well packed and is 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.580
 so took a new dining table oh i hope 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.060
 that I can lift it so list looks 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.860
 right out 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.440
 and actually a bit the same as 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.470
 that lamp behind but then above 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.199
 the dining table with its glass plates underneath 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.539
 so and yes that is a bit more ours 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.520
 thing then and no what hangs there I sat 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.530
 a moment later someone is following 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.960
 So this and we have that might 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.240
 we borrow but yes and chandeliers do not 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.610
 really our taste so we will catch it 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.050
 for this and we are going to shine once 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.930
 on the weekend and next weekend 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.729
 and i am cooking right now and 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.190
 I've got it here 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.070
 I tied it in a pan with and 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.060
 mushroom it your bacon and I have one 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.030
 done it for its cruising 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.190
 the what is actually so with cream 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.190
 garlic and herbs which I 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.620
 through this cream and in the oven 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.210
 sit and potato intact and I can do that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.250
 alarm immediately 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.930
 and these are already kipfiletjes a minute 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.320
 are already completely marinated 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.370
 so they are so ready and medical 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.370
 ripped open and tonight 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.290
 I now have a moment behind the 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.270
 computer 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.400
 actually a long time and I since 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.860
 that I have finished eating because I still have 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.780
 I finished some last things 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.870
 had to finish before tomorrow 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.610
 would be published on the internet 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.710
 and then I'm also going to learn songs
