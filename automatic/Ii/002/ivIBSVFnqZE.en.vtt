00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
actually really really good I really

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.620 
actually really really good I really
don't<00:02:23.010> see<00:02:23.100> disadvantage<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.970> these<00:02:24.120> apart

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630

from<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.140> they're<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.440> they've<00:02:26.070> all<00:02:26.340> got

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
from that they're all they've all got

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.930 
from that they're all they've all got
some<00:02:26.760> sort<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.060> sure<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.540> them<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.940> personally

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
some sort of sure in them and personally

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.150 
some sort of sure in them and personally
well<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.300> think<00:02:30.420> they<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.870> anyway<00:02:31.260> but

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
well I think they go anyway but

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.250
