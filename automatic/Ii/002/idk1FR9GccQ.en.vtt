00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey there guys around Mach 5 and in

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.450 
hey there guys around Mach 5 and in
today's<00:00:02.550> video<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:02.939> am<00:00:03.240> introducing<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.290> new

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
today's video I am introducing the new

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.610 
today's video I am introducing the new
Pistons<00:00:05.460> called<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.120> sticky<00:00:06.569> piston<00:00:06.810> as<00:00:07.259> he<00:00:07.379> see

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
Pistons called a sticky piston as he see

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.250 
Pistons called a sticky piston as he see
in<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:08.010> inventory<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> piston

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
in my inventory here what the piston

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.900 
in my inventory here what the piston
does<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.710> push<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> block<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.580> when<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.820> goes

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
does is push a block and when it goes

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
does is push a block and when it goes
back<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.750> brings<00:00:13.469> up<00:00:13.650> block<00:00:13.889> back<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.309> with

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
back in it brings up block back in with

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.000 
back in it brings up block back in with
it<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.940> stuck<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it so it stuck on it so this is what I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.439 
it so it stuck on it so this is what I
made<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:19.460> so<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> hidden

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
made with this so it can be a hidden

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.590 
made with this so it can be a hidden
door<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.460> push<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.180> was<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
door you just push it if it was on the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
down the sticky piston like the other

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
down the sticky piston like the other
one<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.960> change<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.710> by<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.340> over<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it and thus and I'm sure it won't be

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.609 
it and thus and I'm sure it won't be
pushed<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.450> let's<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.500> haven't

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
pushed up let's have a go so I haven't

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.389 
pushed up let's have a go so I haven't
tried<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> yet<00:01:41.509> well<00:01:42.509> Matt<00:01:42.750> sandstone<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:46.399> don't

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
tried it yet well Matt sandstone I don't

tried it yet well Matt sandstone I don't
know<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.610> it'll<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.789> pushed<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.509> stuck<00:01:48.780> on

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
know if it'll be pushed up or stuck on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.169 
know if it'll be pushed up or stuck on
you'll<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.820> stuck<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:52.429> this<00:01:53.429> is<00:01:53.610> an<00:01:53.729> easy<00:01:53.880> way

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
you'll be stuck on this is an easy way

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.910 
you'll be stuck on this is an easy way
to<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.329> trap<00:01:54.810> doors<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> with

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
to make trap doors that go back in with

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.300 
to make trap doors that go back in with
each<00:01:56.250> other<00:01:57.439> what<00:01:58.439> else<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.189> this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
each other what else can I do if this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.130 
each other what else can I do if this
mild<00:01:59.520> yeah<00:01:59.789> I'll<00:01:59.939> try<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> trap

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
mild yeah I'll try and make that trap

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:18.949 
mild yeah I'll try and make that trap
door<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:06.679> basically<00:02:13.670> I'm<00:02:15.019> having<00:02:17.959> a

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
door right here basically I'm having a
