00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
Latin Ibrahimovic of course after his

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.850 
Latin Ibrahimovic of course after his

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
what yellow of killing his football do

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.839 
what yellow of killing his football do
you<00:02:48.930> think<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:49.950> something<00:02:50.549> that

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
you think that this is something that

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.759 
you think that this is something that
could<00:02:51.000> happen<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.390> live<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.540> dusky<00:02:52.049> or<00:02:52.349> it's

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
could happen to live on dusky or it's

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.580 
could happen to live on dusky or it's
just<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:53.459> think<00:02:54.269> it's<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.840> very<00:02:54.989> different<00:02:55.440> case

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
just I think it's a very different case

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.500 
just I think it's a very different case
and<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:56.040> think<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.760> explain<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.360> case

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and I think we have to explain the case

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.620 
and I think we have to explain the case
of<00:02:57.750> Slaton<00:02:58.200> shortly<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.150> to<00:03:00.150> let<00:03:00.299> people<00:03:00.450> know

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
Slaton was bored as a number nine but

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.530 
Slaton was bored as a number nine but
during<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.950> season<00:03:05.390> Pep<00:03:06.390> Guardiola

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
during the season Pep Guardiola

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
during the season Pep Guardiola
discovered<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.620> game<00:03:07.799> against<00:03:08.220> Real<00:03:08.370> Madrid

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
discovered in a game against Real Madrid

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.539

which<00:03:09.030> they<00:03:09.209> won<00:03:09.360> 6-2<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.950> could<00:03:11.340> be<00:03:11.519> very

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
which they won 6-2 that it could be very

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.180 
which they won 6-2 that it could be very
good<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.150> play<00:03:12.180> occasionally<00:03:13.079> Leo<00:03:13.500> Messi<00:03:13.799> as<00:03:14.130> a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
good to play occasionally Leo Messi as a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.740 
good to play occasionally Leo Messi as a
false<00:03:14.819> number<00:03:15.239> 9<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.810> use<00:03:15.959> him<00:03:16.230> behind<00:03:17.750> you

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
false number 9 to use him behind you

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.270

know<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.200> position<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.829> real<00:03:19.950> striker

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
know the the position of a real striker

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.970 
know the the position of a real striker
and<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.970> hit<00:03:21.150> off<00:03:21.329> really<00:03:21.840> well<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.260> Leo<00:03:22.709> Messi

wanted to play in this position

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.590 
wanted to play in this position
so<00:03:25.319> basically<00:03:25.799> Pep<00:03:26.459> Guardiola<00:03:26.609> was<00:03:27.090> forced

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so basically Pep Guardiola was forced

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.809 
so basically Pep Guardiola was forced
into<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> decision<00:03:28.410> between<00:03:29.010> Slaton

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
into a decision between Slaton

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.640

Ibrahimovic<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.720> Leo<00:03:30.900> Messi<00:03:31.109> he<00:03:31.380> couldn't

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
Ibrahimovic and Leo Messi he couldn't

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.289

play<00:03:31.709> both<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> center<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.970> he

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
play both of them in the center and he

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.750 
play both of them in the center and he
decided<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.870> play<00:03:34.079> Leo<00:03:34.350> there<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.519> why

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
decided to play Leo there so that's why

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.750 
decided to play Leo there so that's why
