used<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> owner<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:27.330> occasional

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
used by the owner was occasional

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.380 
used by the owner was occasional
off-road<00:00:28.529> use<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.369> most<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> driving<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
off-road use but most of the driving is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
off-road use but most of the driving is
on-road<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.140> most<00:00:31.650> people<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.219> these<00:00:32.399> cars

on-road now most people with these cars

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.549 
on-road now most people with these cars
spend<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> lot<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> time<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> road<00:00:33.960> they

spend a lot of time on the road they
underestimate<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> advantages<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.149> changing

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
underestimate the advantages of changing

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.060 
underestimate the advantages of changing
some<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> suspension<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:37.739> talking

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
some of the suspension and I'm talking

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.229 
some of the suspension and I'm talking
about<00:00:38.129> suspension<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:38.940> talking<00:00:39.180> about

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
about suspension I'm talking about

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.170 
about suspension I'm talking about
reducing<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.350> body<00:00:40.559> roll<00:00:40.800> even<00:00:41.700> though<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.030> do

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
reducing the body roll even though we do

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
reducing the body roll even though we do
a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> upgraded<00:00:43.260> sway<00:00:44.010> bars<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.460> these

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a lot of upgraded sway bars on these

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.729 
a lot of upgraded sway bars on these
models<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.480> does<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.899> affect<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> off-road

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
models it does not affect the off-road

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.560 
models it does not affect the off-road
capacity<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.760> overall<00:00:48.059> dead<00:00:48.360> weight

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
capacity because the overall dead weight

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.000 
capacity because the overall dead weight
of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> car<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.989> enough<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> overcome<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
of the car is enough to overcome the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.490 
of the car is enough to overcome the
force<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> stiffer<00:00:51.449> sway<00:00:51.660> bar<00:00:52.020> which

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
force of the stiffer sway bar which

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.080 
force of the stiffer sway bar which
still<00:00:52.770> maintains<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> same<00:00:53.610> articulation

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
still maintains the same articulation

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
still maintains the same articulation
settings<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.340> ability<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.370> off-road

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
settings and ability in off-road

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
settings and ability in off-road
situations<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.750> even<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.559> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
situations so even if you do take this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
situations so even if you do take this
particular<00:00:59.100> power<00:00:59.460> offroad<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
particular power offroad you see it's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
particular power offroad you see it's
got<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> ball<00:01:00.570> bar<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.320> high<00:01:01.800> range<00:01:02.039> tank

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
got a ball bar and a high range tank

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
got a ball bar and a high range tank
with<00:01:02.760> underbody<00:01:03.480> protection<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.500> still<00:01:04.739> has

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
with underbody protection it still has

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
with underbody protection it still has
good<00:01:05.040> off-road<00:01:05.339> capacity<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.689> you'll<00:01:06.840> see

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
good off-road capacity but you'll see

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
good off-road capacity but you'll see
here<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.799> particular<00:01:07.979> bar<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:09.000> upgraded

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

sway bar front and rear will

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
sway bar front and rear will
significantly<00:01:27.450> make<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> car<00:01:28.439> flatter<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you'll have a lot less body roll so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.569 
you'll have a lot less body roll so
because<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.200> company<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> ride<00:01:34.829> even
