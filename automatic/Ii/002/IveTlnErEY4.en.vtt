now the brig is incapacitated so we can

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.940 
now the brig is incapacitated so we can

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
board him if we choose to but since we

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.650 
board him if we choose to but since we
still<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> tower<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.730> deal<00:02:59.879> with<00:03:00.120> we'll

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
still have a tower to deal with we'll

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.210 
still have a tower to deal with we'll
take<00:03:00.870> them<00:03:00.989> down<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.620> finish<00:03:01.890> off<00:03:02.069> this

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
take them down and go finish off this

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.830 
take them down and go finish off this
one

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.410 

even<00:03:08.560> though<00:03:08.709> we<00:03:09.069> can<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> fort<00:03:09.610> these<00:03:09.970> towers

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
even though we can the fort these towers

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.300 
even though we can the fort these towers
still<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> lot<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.230> damage<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.129> still

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
still do a lot of damage so we still

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:27.100 
still do a lot of damage so we still
have<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.610> brace<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:13.030> defend<00:03:13.330> ourselves

now<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> towers<00:03:28.650> are<00:03:28.950> down<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.430> need<00:03:29.520> to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
now that the towers are down we need to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.700 
now that the towers are down we need to
