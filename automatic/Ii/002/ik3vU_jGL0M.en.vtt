00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.380
 it is requested 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.600
 Come Holy Spirit have insurance must be in the Treffpunkt Bahnhofstr 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.539
 The Baltic Sea is often considered to be 800 times twelve years old 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:21.949
 Want to add the addition and how uniqueness of this topic now 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.900
 pending 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.319
 why it was just that 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.269
 Mattmann set his mind to the word Singleton 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.920
 where spoken before 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.950
 she paints whiskey from the distillery also cross 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330
 RAA from the owner too 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.750
 Gold will lose so it's in civilian clothes too he's too risky 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.360
 the sensations from which there were no less than a liter bottle 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.760
 the participation meanwhile there is so well occupied Singleton 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.650
 for this Daft Aachen 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.460
 and in Tofte Horn there are 2 versions a man in twelve years 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.770
 and then there is another 15 years the 15-year-old is now back in 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.500
 Schaan Value thought that there are also some Stendal bottles 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.070
 and these twelve year olds will come to you come 7 liter bottle 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.009
 the special thing about this bottle is something 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.810
 what you do 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.890
 So far, Scottish single painting whiskey has been found she is in fact 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.300
 you can never 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.380
 that makes them very reasonably colored Messi green or summer times 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.090
 probably they lead back to bygone times as green 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.370
 manufactured 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.880
 and the couple 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.930
 that the bottle already she is old 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.710
 and very traditional 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.990
 Thawing Berndorf is one of the only things I had to do 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 there 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 December 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 Owner Stands Schote 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.120
 still almost half of the producing 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.200
 Dortmund is the breakdown one in Scotland so far 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 and jumpers 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.760
 that compares to him and June in the market 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.280
 tree 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.790
 and who the marketing people a bit to sleep 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.810
 enjoy dpa to be on 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.749
 To do that, they have to write perfectly into the final again 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.659
 Plus 800 beautiful empty is not her natural color there is behind 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.159
 to be added 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.580
 so what's interesting here is that they write so 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.909
 Exports firmer 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.559
 Brawn Euro go 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.039
 use 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.480
 us two kids Oak Bluffs 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.719
 at these manufacturers 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.919
 usually 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.979
 why Pacher solid 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.129
 meant 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.099
 Howman 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.120
 and again causing confusion on YouTube can now also be my feast 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.369
 the yield was Euro 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.999
 we understand 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.859
 Enter the profession 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.539
 or perhaps no one knows at 8 o'clock in the evening 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.019
 in love 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.549
 a little bit 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 now 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.029
 Lead heart leap 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.029
 points 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.799
 more 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.189
 the European eel shoots immediately 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.189
 to 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.029
 Sharif fruitiness 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.359
 helped with fruit and in the background it comes 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.699
 fresh fruit last worked 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.719
 maybe also after 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.719
 Citrus fruit is not really tasty now 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.439
 Huge Civic 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.699
 well done 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.699
 abundant fruity 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.079
 this fruit complicates beautiful 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 with the wood 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.639
 Same problems 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.639
 really nice sweet 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.740
 Erfurt 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.430
 subjected 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.400
 the delicate bitterness 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.509
 the rich 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.039
 Chat Room 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.039
 may I maybe 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.150
 the departure pupil 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.870
 victory 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.960
 powerfully finished, bit dry 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.539
 not much 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.839
 have this concept 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.659
 Sina Wolf surprised me 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.089
 I hold him 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.849
 for better than the price set 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.710
 clarified it is relatively cheap 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.779
 and 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.779
 So if they are a price to sip 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.059
 today in the place 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.029
 search 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.089
 soothe 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.960
 Heart to offer to their friends 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.500
 that are just often turn up is the right one if it's a bit more 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.120
 should 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.520
 a little earlier, a little bit stronger 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.009
 Aachen then it should often appear behind with 50 years 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.250
 that's exactly what they are for you 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.189
 Sean Roosen Shops is after him 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.199
 the old bottle is not always available. Oberndorf Tor scored at the moment 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.479
 very good 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.479
 to create the interface 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:17.689
