00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I have enough women. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 I have enough weapons. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 I changed each gem ... 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 ... that people love. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 My footprint will continue in this world forever. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Do not! 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 The king of the Heraklion army, Hyperion ... 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 ... declared war on all mankind. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 When the sky can not defend us. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 If any of you are involved in human conflicts ... 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 ... the punishment will be severe. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 A man chosen by the Gods. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 He joined us 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 If there is a man who will lead them in the battle with Hiperyon ... 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 ... that will be Theseus. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Of the 300 producers. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Maybe the gods are on your side, but you have to start. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Those to whom much is given ... 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 a lot they lose. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Today, we all do something that has never been done before! 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Today we fight for honor! 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Even the gods. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 They need a hero. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Fight for your future! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Fight for your children! 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Fight for immortality! 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 The Gods have made a good choice. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 SOON. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.266
