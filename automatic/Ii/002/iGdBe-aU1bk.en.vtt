00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.960
 share these ideas and let's start 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.329
 with the first end for the newspaper what 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.950
 we will do is we will 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.840

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.790

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.739
 crisis the first constants that we're going to 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.600
 take protector for the street do not 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.610
 we will apply in the parts in which 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.620
 let's go to a dollar for how to prevent 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.239
 any damage to the hair first 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.550
 what we're going to see is that we're going to take a 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.010
 hair section I have two forms of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.500
 enter I call it with the iron is the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.940
 first he took a hair and I start it 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.940
 ripple inward 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.190
 and the second way another section of the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.190
 iron we made once 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:22.050
 when I have it like that once 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.050
 and one of those parties 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.149
 like wavy are different and the truth 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.789
 I like the 2 in both of them - something like that 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.590
 which are you which and then they are indicated 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.420
 if you do you want like the first hairstyles 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.450
 something very casual that can use the color 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.980
 easy 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.550
 for a nominee for Tuesday 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.070
 the zetas with carry out and we're going to 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.780
 take the hair and we will pass it to 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.330

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 let's achieve 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.610
 and now let's move this hair part 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.570
 On Wednesday we will use hooks 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.810
 Now we are going to make a decision 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.460
 and this is how it is 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:50.850
 for Thursday we 're going 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.850
 let's have sex over and over 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.190
 and what we have here we are going to carry 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.320

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.150
 and when we have this thread and we 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.700
 we call the strange 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.700
 here we are with a mentor 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.890
 and so it remains 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.720
 the fifth hairstyle that is for the day 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.069
 Friday what are we going to do what 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.450
 next this hairstyle I'm laughing 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.010
 a lot because it was the one I used in the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.060
 last video I'll explain to you the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.489
 super to what I have done in a 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.170
 tutorial but I learned to do it better 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.989
 let's see a little hair 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.599

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.230

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.230

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.360
 when we have 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.400
 we are going to put it 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.410
 on the other side 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.380
 and that is how it is at the end 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:52.429
 for this sixth hairstyle 

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:52.429
 we make a braid in this part 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.370
 and then we just take 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.430
 here 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.580
 and so we finish 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.590

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.240
 we put black 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.010
