00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.970
 do not 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.769
 next we will present you the 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.769
 implant 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.489
 to begin let's see some aspects 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:46.489
 anatomical tooth 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.050
 the tooth is divided into two parts 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.320
 visible part with which we chew a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.230
 part sunk into the bone the root 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.300
 the periodontium is the set of tissues 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 that help fix the tooth to the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.440
 jaw 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.130
 the loss of a tooth is the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.979
 consequence of the loss of the root 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.180
 while from the root a restoration 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.850
 it's possible 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.650
 the root may have been lost well 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.990
 due to a good blow by the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.510
 completion of the process of a caries or 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.970
 well for a lack of flesh due to a 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 periodontal disease 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.650
 even in the absence of pain or 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.040
 aesthetic deficit this lost tooth 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.640
 it must be replaced 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.360
 indeed our 32 teeth form a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.880
 stable set 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.250
 as for missing a teeth the teeth 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 neighbors try to fill the free space 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.380
 and inevitably move 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.360
 the tooth will tend to move and will propitiate 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.460
 the appearance of interdental spaces 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.130
 accumulations of food debris 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.619
 may appear 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.290
 for this reason the neighboring teeth 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.140
 they can often present tooth decay 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.240
 besides these teeth trying to fill 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.820
 the gap no longer work following your 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.850
 old age and a discharge will be inevitable 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.680
 I lie 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.780
 but this is not all 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.700
 the tooth that is in front of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.160
 the other jaw will also look 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.730
 affected 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.490
 indeed nature hating emptiness 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.360
 so that the opposing tooth comes out of 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.330
 your site to look for support 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.970
 this will favor the appearance of spaces 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.370
 interdental and therefore the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.110
 accumulation of food residues whose 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.440
 consequences we have seen previously 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.320
 so we can say that the absence of 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 a tooth affect short - term 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.300
 seven neighboring teeth 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.220
 this process will spread little by little 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.220
 until reaching all the teeth 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.959
 indeed the patient annoyed by the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.079
 tooth loss chew on the side 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.030
 opposite whose teeth too 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.140
 requested will increase the risk of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.440
 cavities 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.630
 now it is important to insist on the fact 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.640
 that a bad mastication will lead to 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.980
 an overload of work for the 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.040
 stomach and these digestive problems 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.440
 may sometimes be accompanied by an increase 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.080
 or weight loss 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.850
 on the other hand the imbalances 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.040
 caused by the absence and 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.810
 displacement of teeth can 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.840
 cause joint disorders 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.910
 between the skull and the lower jaw 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.440
 this can be accompanied by strong 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.440
 pains in the ear area 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.790
 what can be done to avoid all this 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.220
 the dentist will propose the placement of 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.640
 a prosthesis to replace the teeth 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.550
 absent and restore chewing the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.610
 pronunciation and aesthetics 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.190
 the ideal solution to these problems of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.670
 of sensation is the prosthesis on 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.670
 implant 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.259
 an implant is an artificial root that 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.359
 will anchor in the jaw bone 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:23.720
 we should expect a healing of 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.090
 bone around the implant this time 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.280
 of healing will depend on the state 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.540
 general of the patient and also of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.880
 local factors 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.700
 or general rule the time of 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.700
 healing varies between 2 and 3 months 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.670
 the planned prosthesis can only be 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.620
 performed when the implant is 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.620
 find it well integrated into the bone 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.520
 but in which case you can resort to the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.520
 placement of an implant 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.050
 It's simple since the implant allows 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:05.450
 solve all cases of temptation 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.450
 to start the from unitary nation 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.529
 the implant then comes to support 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.289
 a classic crown 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.629
 this avoids touching neighboring teeth that 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.220
 we should mutilate to make a 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.280
 bridge 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.670
 but if the sensation is more extended 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.460
 It is also possible to place one or several 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.190
 implants in order to reestablish the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.889
 integrity of the dental arch without touching 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.169
 the remaining teeth 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.909
 the implant also has another utility 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.370
 of importance 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.529
 indeed implants also allow 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.090
 keep the appliances removable 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.910
 complete 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.280
 especially the one below that due to lack of 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.820
 stability often annoy the 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.940
 patient 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.600
 in this case two or more implants will be 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.600
 required 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.129
 these implants will be joined by a 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.810
 bar or will support link systems 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.810
 with the removable device 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.860
 the implant seems to be the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.960
 ideal solution but it is always 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.729
 recommendable 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.370
 unfortunately not the state of health 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:20.550
 of the patient some diseases like 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.390
 diabetes severe smoking can 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.820
 be unfavorable factors 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.130
 obviously the amount of bone 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.030
 available should be enough to 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.610
 insert the implant 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.790
 otherwise there is the possibility 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.620
 of adding bone using a graft 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.080
 osseous 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.180
 on the contrary the implant will not be 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.610
 possible in the patient with a hygiene 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.740
 deficient and that does not submit to the 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.740
 control visit 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.319
 in conclusion restrictions apart 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.240
 We can affirm that the techniques of 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:07:00.630
 implantation are now totally 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.630
 reliable and offer excellent results 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.009
 we thank you for your attention
