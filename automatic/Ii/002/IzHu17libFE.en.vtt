 live in the kitchen today 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.099
 I bring a recipe for a juice 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.759
 carrot this is super good for the 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:21.100
 skin to keep a skin this with 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:23.650
 healthy shine and to be eliminating if 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.720
 you have acne problems and well let's 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.790
 put oranges because we need the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.490
 Vitamin C also at this time cold 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.280
 the carrot also has vitamin 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.130
 do and well the cucumber is super 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.520
 moisturizing we need to maintain a 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.440
 very nice skin keep our body 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 hydrated and for that is the cucumber the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.450
 cucumber water is structured this 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.550
 it means that everything is like water 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.850
 normal normal water if it helps us a lot 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.890
 but it is to sweep everything that the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.899
 fruits and vegetables are taking off 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.610
 to help the body get it out but 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.020
 the cucumber water is structured and 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.290
 that's going to help you go and take all 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.689
 the nutrients to the cells and good the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.240
 celery has amount of sodium we need 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.760
 good sodium like celery 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.890
 so that we can retain the minerals 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.130
 and good apart also has a lot of water 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.690
 it is moisturizing the carrot all this we 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.600
 is going to help clean our kidneys 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.760
 also to take out that which is not 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 we need is diuretic and good the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 Ginger is super good to remove 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.740
 bugs and apart this will help us 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.410
 open the paths the channels of the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.000
 blood of everything so that they penetrate the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.530
 nutrients well to where they have to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.520
 come and well I'm already shut up and we started 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.799
 putting all the extractor 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.710
 and here I take my juice 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.009
 oranges and make them back in my 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.649
 Super jar leaves and carrot with 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.600
 everything does not fight anything bad is there is 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.369
 super super good 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.100
 disinfect because also the cascarita 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.750
 It has good nutrients and there is a 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.060
 bit more bitter but good as it has 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.860
 a lot of orange is going to leave it like this 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.120
 cucumber we can leave with everything and skin 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.890
 but it's just that it was organic 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.340
 because good this I bought it in the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.720
 super and the truth felt with a lot 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 very bright and so with many of 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.930
 those wounds that are putting them 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.959
 and better is the best not because that will be 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.970
 to remove the body's boot is very 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.940
 difficult then good we keep getting 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.190
 all the extractor 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.170
 I also comment if you want 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.580
 Tanning in hot weather a lot of juice 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.090
 of carrots will help them to grab 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.290
 a very nice bronzer and no need 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.670
 to get both in the sun and here by 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.550
 last I've already made my piece of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.730
 ginger will be that 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.940
 Well, as it is a bit, look at them 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.580
 I show this one is very strong and it is very 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.160
 spicy if you put them a lot 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.620
 then if they just start taking 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.290
 Juice as a little piece 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.090
 Increasingly increasing is super good 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.570
 the ginger truth I recommend it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.610
 I miss it almost all my juices 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.540
 this to get them visits that do not 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.270
 we want and then as I say, open the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.260
 paths for us to absorb 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.260
 much better all the nutrients 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.560
 and I want my super juice and I do 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.780
 such large amounts this is like a 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.120
 liter and a half but because to me is what 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.190
 I like to have breakfast a juice I feel 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.709
 as lighter this with a lot of energy and 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.230
 well it's much better so something light by 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.910
 the morning so you can walk with 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.650
 all the batteries then we put every 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.920
 body thing in the morning and then not 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.319
 we feel two heavy and unwilling 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.069
 then I like it if I climb toto 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.269
