00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 good morning and welcome this new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.520
 tutorial i am michael bay youth e 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.040
 I'm here today to teach you how to fold 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.429
 the paper to do this with pistarelli 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.089
 oregano precisely because it is beautiful am bad 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.420
 men but also the eyes which is a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.949
 Simple embroidery are sheets of paper 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 square well you could start flying 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:33.090
 but take a sheet of paper 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.010
 square obtained from a sheet a4 e 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.910
 first thing we do a turn in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.180
 diagonal 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 you see it there is already I didn't have mine 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 handy cutter and I had to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.579
 cutting the sheet to recover old 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 way 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 we keep the paper in this way 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 I call this tip half again 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.980
 must reach the opposite extreme and not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:08.340
 we fold we mark only here where it is 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.470
 find the goal we will not need after eliot 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.049
 and then in this in this position e 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.159
 we fold the sheet making this 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.159
 tip we bring it down 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.070
 let's see this with a bit of space 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.409
 triangle outside we pay him off 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.060
 upwards not even this time the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.440
 we leave the triangle outwards 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.270
 and we have to make this area 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:42.180
 we know well or badly in height equal to 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 this area is more or less roughly not 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
 it is so important to be precise not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.259
 go get rulers know what to do 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.940
 for heaven's sake and as I said now 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.350
 we take the sheet again and it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.600
 let's explain downwards 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.690
 all these folds must fit together ok 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.360
 we understand the sheet and we turn it and 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.459
 remember this bend born 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.170
 we have done here serves us as a point 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.870
 reference because we have to take 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.890
 this end and bring this side 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 then to the center 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.970
 now instead we have to make a turn 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.739
 on this line so let's go to the sheet 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.739
 and we pray so 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.900
 take the sheet turn it is now 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 we must take this line on this 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.930
 line 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.550
 ciro sheet are more comfortable as well 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.380
 at this point we must 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.690
 invert the fold on this line here 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.220
 so we have not reversed the inter and 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.700
 don't fold backwards then 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.700
 a mountain fold in this way 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.750
 hold this fold that now there 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.390
 then we repeat on this side 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.760
 we take back the sheet or we turn e 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.760
 we report this side on this photo 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.950
 now we ask on this line 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.250
 turn to the sheet I'll call you on this 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
 This line goes to this line 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.870
 and then we see many here 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.470
 we must do something we must 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.510
 take it triangular but not both 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.580
 the ends then open it in this 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.560
 so make a little upward fold 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.820
 more than half a millimeter but it is in between 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.820
 there is just over half a centimeter 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.450
 let's take this is the apply but a 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.480
 couple of millimeters lower 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.850
 if you have a color sheet to this 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.950
 point should see your teeth here 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.570
 because the white that should stand out 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.310
 this is not a cold of color 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.070
 unfortunately, it is not visible now 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:46.510
 take these two ends of the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:48.690
 sheet and we have to bend this part 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.900
 of these sentry angles upwards 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.360
 so let's go the verses in inches 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.050
 we crush the sheet a little let's go a 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.050
 little pressure 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:10.960
 in this way it seems almost here here yes 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:15.940
 make a space for the eyes but if 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.330
 you want as I did lately 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.330
 eyes 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:33.650
 let's make a happy look that beautiful 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:33.650
 come now take the wings and open them 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.810
 these must be opened like this 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.550
 these are the last ones behind me not 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.060
 form a kind of angle 90 degrees a 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.240
 little less 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.700
 we can also put your finger 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.450
 here at the end of the fold and pull towards 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.200
 the outside 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:06:00.270
 the rest we showed the pistarelli 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.490
 Veneto and also for today the tutorials are 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.020
 finished but if you want to fold more paper 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.950
 I've prepared playlists for you 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.020
 otherwise 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.400
