00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.189
 incisions and we hang periodontal 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.889
 the periodontal treatment includes 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.900
 many times a surgical phase per 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.420
 It is therefore necessary to carry out 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.730
 main incisions and flaps that 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.490
 they use more often in surgeries 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.369
 periodontal in this presentation 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.950
 we will try to briefly summarize some 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.010
 of its characteristics 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.050
 an incision is the division or the cut 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.840
 of soft tissues with an instrument 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.360
 cutting or scalpel in practice 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 surgical is the first time 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.109
 of the operation 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 let's start by describing some 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:46.079
 incisions we will first tackle the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.629
 incision to external bevel which is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.539
 indicated in the case of fake bags or 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.780
 supra bones those that measure 4 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.149
 millimeters to make an incision to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 external bevel there must be an adequate 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.690
 keratin gum raised notice the address 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.230
 of the scalpel blade opposite the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.200
 crest 2a 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.600
 It is also indicated for areas of 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 Enlargement without gival is when there is 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.820
 gum of fibrotic type and to facilitate 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 procedures in dentistry 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.430
 restorative in the incision that is 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.050
 effect in gilo procedures take a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.050
 jin yibo plastic 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.430
 the intra incision believes to link or intra 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 circular 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 allows to keep the maximum amount of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 keratin gum raised to be the most 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.190
 conservative is done by entering the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 gingival sulcus is used in the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.130
 hung newman and whitman like 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 we will see later 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.610
 the decision avis the intern is made to 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.760
 half a millimeter or a millimeter of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.910
 gingival margin the scalpel blade is 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.030
 directs to the crest or is this incision 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.340
 leaves a gingival wedge or collar that does not 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 it's more than the outer wall of the bag 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.070
 which should be eliminated this kind of 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.630
 incision in the first to be performed in 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.230
 the modified whitman flap 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.050
 the internet area incision facilitates the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.260
 removal of the gingival collar after the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.840
 incision to internal bevel or reverse is 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.730
 best done with a scalpel orbÃ¡n 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.650
 level of the free faces and the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.130
 inter proximal spaces like 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.950
 we appreciate in the image 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.170
 the vertical or liberating incisions 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.580
 can be done at each end of a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.040
 flap can be one or two you're 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.740
 incisions facilitate the confrontation 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.950
 of small flaps for example those that 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.550
 they cover a few teeth 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.459
 vertical decisions must reach 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.800
 Mainline much is important 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.040
 insist that these incisions should 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.410
 encompass the entire papilla never divide it 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.170
 in two 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.660
 the incisions for distal wedge are 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.050
 they perform when there is retro molar gingiva 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.660
 or thick cap in event areas the 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.940
 make this decision to eliminate 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.520
 periodontal pockets crystals in the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.970
 retro molar area and also allow the 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.130
 bone remodeling the incision should 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.830
 have the correct inclination for 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.140
 lose weight the jobs we see in the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.830
 image the removal of a portion of 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.620
 retro molar area tissue 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.020
 now we will review the flaps more 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.080
 employees in periodontal surgeries is 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.510
 of access a flap is the separation 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.300
 surgical treatment of a tissue portion of 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.390
 the underlying tissues conserving their 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.240
 irrigation is done in order to 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.160
 provide visibility access to the bone 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.040
 the entire root surface 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.210
 the bass of newman is the first to 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.640
 that we are going to refer 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.360
 Neuman flap starts with a 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.670
 intracircular incision and then it 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.970
 lift the flap to pocket though 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 incisions can also be made 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.609
 liberating in the case of flaps 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.129
 small to facilitate their separation 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.280
 the bass of newman allows access 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:28.590
 to the roots conservatively by 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.110
 So much is especially indicated in 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.330
 aesthetic areas and in those areas that 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.330
 have little gum that was used 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.330
 the modified whitman flap is one 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.810
 of the most employees for the treatment 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.150
 of the disease ask to start with 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.610
 an incision to internal bevel as 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.520
 we can observe the figure conserving 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.920
 the interventor pin and its main 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.830
 advantage is that there is a minimum of loss 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.710
 of periodontal tissue which is 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.050
 favorable for the aesthetics of the smile 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.810
 when the replacement of a 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.820
 wii flap comes a whitman 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.700
 immediate contact of connective tissue 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.160
 with the tooth surface another of the 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.680
 advantages is that there is an exposure 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.970
 minimum radicle which reduces the 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.970
 hypersensitivity problems 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.139
 as conclusions we can say that 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.869
 There are several types of incisions and 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.209
 flaps in periodontics in some cases 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:33.079
 we will find variations in the technique 

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:35.419
 according to the different authors remember 

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:37.729
 whenever the flaps should be handled 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.819
 delicately getting a good 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.899
 replacement and adaptation of the same to 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.899
 through the sutures 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.450
 Any questions or queries can 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.510
 perform it through this medium or with 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.990
