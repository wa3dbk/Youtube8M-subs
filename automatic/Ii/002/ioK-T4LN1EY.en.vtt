00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.380
 hello to everyone who continues to watch my 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 vlog life of so and if you 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.230
 are interested in 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 what happens next with my 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.320
 recovery project 6 series of this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.629
 old bmw we now come to this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.710
 the moment that we already need to pull out 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 engine and we already found a bunch of problems with 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 him this is what he needs completely 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 change all gaskets need to be changed 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 piston 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.839
 and I just took a query by how much 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.570
 it will cost only spare parts 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.839
 comes out to make change all 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.600
 piston all on gasket also still 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.360
 I thought clutch change it all to me 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.750
 only in parts becomes 1200 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 dollars and I began to guess think 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 is it worth the engine at all with it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.500
 do something to wet 1200 you lie 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.770
 try for example to look for another 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.930
 some motor and I got a car 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 one pretty interesting option 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 now the window and go i will show it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 and now I will show you what I bought 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.860
 this here parts are not visible here is dark and 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.710
 so I decided to moan 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.619
 1200 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.100
 to the motor which is practically nothing 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.080
 you canâ€™t add a turbo for him very much 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:57.640
 cost much then we decided to take the car 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.970
 approximate years and with better 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.330
 engine and this is BMW 7 Series 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.700
 body and 23 is not easy 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:13.150
 seven is 745 oh which has a turbo 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.209
 already the engine diode decided with the turbine and their 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 you brought them very little to america 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:24.430
 sold only in germany aluminum 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.410
 parts become oxidized but he 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.880
 the engine works at all fine we its 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.420
 wound up everything works butter is not a day and 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.430
 running mileage 70,000 compared to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.739
 what I think of recovering 120 almost 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.860
 if you just fell on this car 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.769
 tree and here she is very so strong 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.950
 hit the backseat I don't know we 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.260
 still they did not pull out but not in such 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.880
 bad condition could on them by 1 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.230
 the car had water passenger seats 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 front and driver's seat pretty 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.450
 still in good condition they are dry if 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.239
 only they need to be cleaned and also here 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.459
 here is the panel from there all the tree which 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:12.640
 here here from just from moisture bye it 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.950
 jarred like that so the video here even in 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.000
 spider web on it so that's all the whole panel 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.170
 everything is written in german 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.049
 that is, the car was completely 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.780
 imported by previous owner from 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.280
 germany 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.590
 so we will flip it completely 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.049
 this whole part this whole engine 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.480
 turbine all all these parts into that six 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:46.329
 on when did this riana chase hired 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.989
 tow truck and removed the tank there on the spot removed 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.850
 cardan removed the exhaust pipe and bumper 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.160
 this is also removed 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.750
 that he was still quite pathetic 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.080
 I can fortify the fortification 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.140
 completely replaced with rear stopar 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.950
 have remained normal, I have them 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.980
 they took me to the garage lie and also hatch 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.190
 there was a whole well, in principle, I think something 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.120
 what else can i sell and parts and 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.240
 I think pretty well fail 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.610
 A good option, that is, this is the whole 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.310
 I took the car for 900 dollars and that 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.650
 recover 1200 only by one 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.750
 engine think there is a complete reason was 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.270
 buy this car fast engine 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.360
 which already has a lot more resource 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
 and plus he is already as I say worth 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 this turbine 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.500
 that is, it will not be much longer 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.900
 more interesting to work so thanks that 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.820
 watch my videos about my project 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.500
 recovery BMW 6 Series 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.480
 79, I hope that when I leave 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.750
 because a lot of work we are here 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:01.160
 let's go bought a bunch of tools 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.160
 Jacks bought and will work 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.189
