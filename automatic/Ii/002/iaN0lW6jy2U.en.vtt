although<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.830> character<00:01:45.280> remains<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.880> same

although the character remains the same

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.570 
although the character remains the same
there's<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.290> different<00:01:47.770> intensity<00:01:48.280> and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
there's a different intensity and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.060 
there's a different intensity and
different<00:01:49.420> approaches<00:01:50.200> but<00:01:50.560> this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
different approaches but this

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.520 
different approaches but this
transformers<00:01:51.850> fall<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.450> Cybertron<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.470> a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
transformers fall of Cybertron is is a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.100 
transformers fall of Cybertron is is a
lot<00:01:54.040> different<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.970> has<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.330> elements<00:01:56.020> of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
lot different it has the elements of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.219 
lot different it has the elements of
emotion<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:56.910> there's<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:58.030> lot<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.509> relation<00:01:59.050> to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
emotion and there's a lot of relation to

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.830 
emotion and there's a lot of relation to
character<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.729> game<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.180> not<00:02:01.630> only

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
character and so this game is not only

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.070 
character and so this game is not only
fun<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.289> do<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:03.550> seems<00:02:04.090> much<00:02:04.450> more<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.899> all

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
fun to do and it seems much more of all

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.850 
fun to do and it seems much more of all
of<00:02:05.680> involvement<00:02:06.280> into<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.670> story<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:08.110> think

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
of involvement into a story and I think

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.250 
of involvement into a story and I think
that's<00:02:09.039> going<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:10.420> real<00:02:10.630> take<00:02:10.899> for<00:02:11.140> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that's going to be the real take for it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.510 
that's going to be the real take for it
i<00:02:11.350> think<00:02:11.620> till<00:02:12.550> all<00:02:12.850> are<00:02:13.420> one
