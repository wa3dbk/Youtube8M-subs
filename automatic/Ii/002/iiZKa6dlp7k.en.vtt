thing<00:00:06.750> you're<00:00:06.870> gonna<00:00:06.930> want<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> do<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.500> take

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
thing you're gonna want to do is take

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.919 
thing you're gonna want to do is take
this<00:00:07.950> off<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.550> ceiling<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.970> twist<00:00:09.780> it

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
this off of the ceiling you twist it

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.669 
this off of the ceiling you twist it
counterclockwise<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.860> it'll<00:00:11.070> pop<00:00:11.250> off<00:00:12.679> next

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
counterclockwise and it'll pop off next

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.320 
counterclockwise and it'll pop off next
open<00:00:14.009> up<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> cover<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.820> take<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
open up the cover and take out the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.760 
open up the cover and take out the
battery<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.809> assumed<00:00:16.199> you've<00:00:16.440> tried

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
battery and I assumed you've tried

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.500 
battery and I assumed you've tried
replacing<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.520> battery<00:00:17.820> let's<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.240> assume

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
replacing the battery let's just assume

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.240 
replacing the battery let's just assume
you<00:00:19.140> know<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> batteries<00:00:19.800> good<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.130> you've

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
you know the batteries good and you've

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.650 
you know the batteries good and you've
already<00:00:20.430> done<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.570> still

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
already done that and it's still

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859 
already done that and it's still
chirping<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:24.119> off<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> ceiling<00:00:24.600> it's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
chirping so with it off the ceiling it's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.750 
chirping so with it off the ceiling it's
you<00:00:25.109> disconnect<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> wires<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.580> take

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you disconnect the wires here you take

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.130 
you disconnect the wires here you take
out<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> battery<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.050> gonna

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
out the battery and then you're gonna

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.870 
out the battery and then you're gonna
hold<00:00:28.410> down<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.800> test<00:00:29.099> button<00:00:31.309> that's<00:00:32.309> dying

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
hold down this test button that's dying

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
hold down this test button that's dying
out<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:33.809> gonna<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.260> drain

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
out and what that's gonna do is drain

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.240 
out and what that's gonna do is drain
any<00:00:35.250> charge<00:00:35.880> left<00:00:36.239> inside<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.250> hopefully

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
any charge left inside and hopefully

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
any charge left inside and hopefully
help<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> reset<00:00:39.030> itself<00:00:39.600> from<00:00:39.960> whatever

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
help this to reset itself from whatever

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
help this to reset itself from whatever
caused<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.070> start<00:00:41.340> chirping<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> first

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
caused it to start chirping in the first

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.319 
caused it to start chirping in the first
place<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.110> hold<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.530> for<00:00:43.590> 15<00:00:44.070> seconds<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
place so hold this down for 15 seconds I

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.970 
place so hold this down for 15 seconds I
have<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.960> open<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.829> what's

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
have one open so you can see what's

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.560 
have one open so you can see what's
going<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.370> inside<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> capacitors<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
going on inside the capacitors here and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.860 
going on inside the capacitors here and
things<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.230> hold<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.770> charge

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
things like that will hold a charge

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.939 
things like that will hold a charge
they're<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.500> batteries

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
they're kind of like little batteries

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.939 
they're kind of like little batteries
not<00:00:56.280> exactly<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.820> close<00:00:56.969> enough<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.949> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
not exactly but close enough and that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.670 
not exactly but close enough and that
can<00:00:59.309> store<00:00:59.820> information<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> hold

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
can store information so if you hold

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.310 
can store information so if you hold
down<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> test<00:01:02.309> button<00:01:02.780> 15<00:01:03.780> seconds<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
down the test button 15 seconds it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.820 
down the test button 15 seconds it
should<00:01:04.619> reset<00:01:05.060> also<00:01:06.060> once<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.659> off<00:01:09.830> since

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
should reset also once it's off since

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.050 
should reset also once it's off since
you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> off<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.700> should<00:01:11.850> blow

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you have it off you should blow

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260 
you have it off you should blow
compressed<00:01:12.450> air<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:14.270> piece

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
compressed air into it this little piece

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.499 
compressed air into it this little piece
here<00:01:15.299> sits<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.060> however<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
here sits like that and however this

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.249 
here sits like that and however this
scientifically<00:01:19.290> works<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.840> senses<00:01:21.840> smoking

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
scientifically works it senses smoking

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.340 
scientifically works it senses smoking
things<00:01:22.700> but<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> dust<00:01:24.600> buildup<00:01:25.080> or

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
things but if there's a dust buildup or

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
things but if there's a dust buildup or
if<00:01:25.439> there's<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> bug<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:25.979> crawled<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.580> here

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
if there's a bug that crawled in here

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.719 
if there's a bug that crawled in here
built<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.450> spiderweb<00:01:28.409> whatever<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.549> can

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
built a little spiderweb whatever it can

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
built a little spiderweb whatever it can
cause<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.180> thing<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.720> work<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.799> well

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
cause this thing to not work so so well

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
cause this thing to not work so so well
so<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> block<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.720> dust<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.780> see

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so what you do to block the dust you see

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
so what you do to block the dust you see
these<00:01:37.049> vent<00:01:37.320> holes<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> top<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.520> get

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
these vent holes on the top you just get

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.350 
these vent holes on the top you just get
an<00:01:38.850> air<00:01:39.000> compressor<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.100> buy<00:01:41.400> cans<00:01:42.119> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
an air compressor you can buy cans of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
an air compressor you can buy cans of
compressed<00:01:42.750> air<00:01:42.869> too<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.860> have

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
compressed air too so if you don't have

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
compressed air too so if you don't have
one<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> these<00:01:44.340> compressors<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> hose<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
one of these compressors with a hose you

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590 
one of these compressors with a hose you
can<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.100> looks<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> wd-40

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
can just get you know looks like a wd-40

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.350 
can just get you know looks like a wd-40
can<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.049> blow<00:01:49.140> air<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.710> also<00:01:50.250> go<00:01:51.210> ahead

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
can and blow air in here also go ahead

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.090 
can and blow air in here also go ahead
and<00:01:51.479> blow<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.140> around<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> sides

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100
