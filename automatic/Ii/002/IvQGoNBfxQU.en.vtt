00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
magnets this tank this bag will not fly

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.819 
magnets this tank this bag will not fly
off<00:02:45.599> that's<00:02:46.049> for<00:02:46.200> sure<00:02:46.379> but<00:02:47.129> it's<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.299> rugged

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829

is pretty much what it looks like while
it's<00:03:13.620> mounted<00:03:14.159> okay<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> fairly<00:03:16.290> big

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
it's mounted okay so it is a fairly big

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.770 
it's mounted okay so it is a fairly big
hefty<00:03:17.159> bag<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.849> know<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.239> wrap<00:03:18.479> around

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
hefty bag you know it can wrap around

so I mean you can get a good amount of

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.920 
so I mean you can get a good amount of
stuff<00:05:38.610> while<00:05:38.909> it's<00:05:39.120> things<00:05:39.389> like<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.750> I

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
stuff while it's things like that I

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.980 
stuff while it's things like that I
typically<00:05:40.529> carry<00:05:40.889> I<00:05:41.010> don't<00:05:41.250> know<00:05:41.310> Tylenol

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
typically carry I don't know Tylenol

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.680 
typically carry I don't know Tylenol
pocket<00:05:43.529> knife<00:05:43.680> something<00:05:43.979> like<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.400> but<00:05:45.360> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
pocket knife something like that but the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.939 
pocket knife something like that but the
beauty<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.080> this<00:05:46.260> thing<00:05:46.500> is<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.830> is

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
beauty of this thing is that it is

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.379 
beauty of this thing is that it is
expandable<00:05:48.199> so<00:05:49.199> the<00:05:50.099> zipper<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:50.880> expandable

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
expandable so the zipper the expandable

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.230 
expandable so the zipper the expandable
zipper<00:05:51.659> is<00:05:51.750> right<00:05:51.930> underneath<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:53.240> it

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
zipper is right underneath and it

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.129 
zipper is right underneath and it
expands<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:55.080> lot

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.649 

it's<00:06:00.379> kind<00:06:00.710> of<00:06:00.740> get<00:06:00.919> you<00:06:01.039> an<00:06:01.129> idea<00:06:01.430> there<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.569> is

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
it's kind of get you an idea there it is

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.540 
it's kind of get you an idea there it is
expanded<00:06:03.289> you<00:06:03.379> can<00:06:03.560> see<00:06:03.830> how<00:06:04.099> much<00:06:04.340> it

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
expanded you can see how much it

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.119 
expanded you can see how much it
actually<00:06:04.580> expands<00:06:05.419> I<00:06:05.509> give<00:06:05.689> that<00:06:05.840> about<00:06:06.129> three

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
actually expands I give that about three

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.309 
actually expands I give that about three
inches<00:06:07.460> or<00:06:07.639> so<00:06:07.819> so<00:06:08.569> that's<00:06:08.900> how<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:09.289> is

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
inches or so so that's how it is

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.459 
inches or so so that's how it is
expanded<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.370> now<00:06:10.729> I<00:06:11.120> can<00:06:11.810> pretty<00:06:12.020> much<00:06:12.110> fit

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
expanded and now I can pretty much fit

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.879 
expanded and now I can pretty much fit
my<00:06:12.650> entire<00:06:13.330> fist<00:06:14.330> in<00:06:14.689> there<00:06:14.960> close<00:06:15.590> till<00:06:15.740> about

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
my entire fist in there close till about

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.580 
my entire fist in there close till about
right<00:06:16.219> here<00:06:16.639> so<00:06:17.300> that's<00:06:17.509> a<00:06:17.629> good<00:06:17.810> you<00:06:18.139> know<00:06:18.199> six

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
right here so that's a good you know six

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.309 
right here so that's a good you know six
inches<00:06:18.889> or<00:06:19.069> so<00:06:19.219> maybe<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.150> little<00:06:20.180> bit<00:06:20.389> less<00:06:20.599> but

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
inches or so maybe a little bit less but

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.520 
inches or so maybe a little bit less but
so<00:06:21.710> it<00:06:21.860> expands<00:06:22.219> very<00:06:22.879> very<00:06:23.330> nicely<00:06:23.659> okay<00:06:24.469> so

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
so it expands very very nicely okay so

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.040 
so it expands very very nicely okay so
if<00:06:24.770> you<00:06:24.889> you<00:06:25.490> want<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.699> carry<00:06:25.969> more<00:06:26.900> stuff

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
if you you want to carry more stuff

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.189 
if you you want to carry more stuff
handy<00:06:27.770> stuff<00:06:27.979> not<00:06:28.189> big<00:06:28.520> sized<00:06:28.789> items<00:06:29.210> but<00:06:29.900> you

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
see here there it is expanded and I'm

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.050 
see here there it is expanded and I'm
going<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.860> close<00:06:37.069> it<00:06:37.219> up<00:06:37.310> so<00:06:37.460> you<00:06:37.520> can<00:06:37.699> see<00:06:37.879> how
