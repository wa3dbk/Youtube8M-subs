00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 voices and cries of hell recorded 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 from an excavation of 14 to 4 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.620
 kilometers on earth the son of god 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.900
 He came to give us life and salvation if 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 you accept that he died for your sins and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.730
 with his resurrection he gave us life 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.949
 you will be saved from this terrible end saved 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.050
 Today, it's time your soul is what 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.080
 It is worth not the cares of this world 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 share this material article made of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
 the translation of the following note from the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.130
 English about what was published in the newspaper 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.219
 Finnish unless you to a group 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.290
 geological that drilled a hole 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.079
 approximately 14 to 4 kilometers from 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.629
 depth in the earth's crust 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 He says he heard human screams screams 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.489
 are of the souls condemned in the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.739
 deeper hole the terrified 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.899
 scientists are scared of having 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 allowed to the evil energies of 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 hell climb up to the surface 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 terrestrial the information that we have 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.170
 gathered is so amazing that we're 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 sincerely scared about what can 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 be what we find down there said 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.950
 the doctor to sac in what 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.899
 of the project in the distant cyber and a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.780
 surprise was the high temperature that 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.270
 discovered the calculations indicate that the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.729
 temperature was close to 1,100 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.969
 degrees centigrade or over 2,000 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.759
 precise fahrenheit degrees to cecof is more 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.500
 what we had hoped for is almost like 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.319
 a hell of fire brutally 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.200
 lit in the center of the earth the 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.720
 last discovery was however the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.880
 more impactful to our ears so much 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.479
 that the scientists are sincerely 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 scared to continue with the project 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.439
 we try to listen to the movements of 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.020
 the earth and measure the dimensions of the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.970
 bag at certain intervals with the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.700
 super sensitive microphones that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.880
 we descended through the hole what 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.319
 we hear change what scientists 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.259
 logically they thought to hear inside a 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.659
 tremor was sometimes a weak but sharp 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.299
 sound that we thought came from our 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.520
 sound equipment explained the doctor to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.399
 dry after some adjustments 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.979
 we understood that the sound came from 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.950
 from the inside of the earth just 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.920
 we could believe our ears we heard 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.409
 a human voice screaming in pain even 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.780
 when a voice was perceptible we 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.450
 we could listen to thousands maybe 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.819
 millions of suffering souls screaming in 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 the background after this discovery 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.230
 horrifying almost half of the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.590
 scientists were paralyzed because 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.140
 to hopefully fear what is 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.510
 down there it will stay there added the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.299
 Doctor does what he really does 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.760
 paralyzed the Soviets apart from the 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.650
 voice recordings was the aspect of the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.750
 same night with a gas source 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.090
 light that emerged from the site of 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.489
 drill and that in an incandescent pillar 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.680
 you heard the words in Russian I've 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.889
 conquered said under the dark sky 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.920
 from Siberia the event was absolutely 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:05.099
 unreal the Soviets screamed in terror 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.109
 said Mr. Numeral later that 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.139
 night ambulance circulated in the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.389
 community a driver knows that the 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.400
 scientists were sedated with a 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.890
 medicine that erases memory 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.510
 term the Soviets used that 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.329
 substance in the treatment of 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.060
 victims of shock comes another note as 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.400
 communist said to sack I do not believe in the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.700
 heaven neither in the bible but as a 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.019
 scientist now I believe in hell 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.609
 Needless to say, they gave us a 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.890
 electric shock with such 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.579
 discovery but we know what we saw 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.959
 and we hear we are absolutely 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.780
 convinced that we drill through 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.239
 from the gates of hell the doctor to 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.639
 sack continued the drill began 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.980
 suddenly to rotate violently 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.310
 indicating that we had reached a 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.409
 bag or a cavern or a large vacuum 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.750
 the temperature sensors showed a 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.569
 dramatic increase in heat at 2000 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.970
 degrees fahrenheit we lower a microphone 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.370
 designed to detect the sounds of 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.189
 the movements of the plate below the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.290
 axis but instead of the movements of the 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.019
 plate we heard a human voice screaming 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.659
 of pain we thought at first that the 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.780
 sound came from our team when 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.280
 we made adjustments our worst 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.860
 suspicions were confirmed 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.260
 the screams were not from a single human being 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.260
 but they were the cries of millions of 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.020
 humans the son of god came to give us 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.910
 life and salvation if you accept that he died 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.230
 for your sins and with his resurrection 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.750
 he gave us life 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.970
 you will be saved from this terrible end saved 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.740
 today that is time your soul is what 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.740
 It is worth not the cares of this world 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.740
 share this material the art of serving 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.910
