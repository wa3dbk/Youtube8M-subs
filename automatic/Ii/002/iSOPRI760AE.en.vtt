hardcore game I mean it just seems to be
a<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.840> misleading<00:00:55.260> when<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:55.949> say<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
a bit misleading when they say it's a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.900 
a bit misleading when they say it's a
very<00:00:56.610> hardcore<00:00:56.910> game<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.050> package<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
very hardcore game on the package and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.180 
very hardcore game on the package and
the<00:00:59.910> art<00:01:00.120> style<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.809> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.289> lame<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> mean<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the art style is kind of lame I mean the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.270 
the art style is kind of lame I mean the
the<00:01:02.879> oranges<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> silvers<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.739> blend<00:01:05.070> into

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the oranges and silvers that blend into

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.280 
the oranges and silvers that blend into
each<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.630> work<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
each other really don't work well and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.920 
each other really don't work well and
the<00:01:07.860> no<00:01:08.280> ending<00:01:08.760> screen<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> very<00:01:09.659> very

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the no ending screen is very very

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.200 
the no ending screen is very very
generic<00:01:10.680> I'm<00:01:11.189> sorry<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> spoil<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> ending

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
generic I'm sorry to spoil the ending

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.300 
generic I'm sorry to spoil the ending
but<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:13.200> doubt<00:01:13.500> few<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> care<00:01:14.549> anyway

but I'm doubt few of you care anyway

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
but I'm doubt few of you care anyway
overall<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.640> game<00:01:17.939> isn't<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.840> worth<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
overall this game isn't really worth the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
overall this game isn't really worth the
four<00:01:19.560> dollars<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> costs<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.030> just
