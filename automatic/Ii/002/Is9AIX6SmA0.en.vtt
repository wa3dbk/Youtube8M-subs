00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
we estimate that they're over a million

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.309 
we estimate that they're over a million
artifacts<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:40.329> million<00:02:41.329> artifacts<00:02:41.810> down<00:02:42.049> there

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
artifacts a million artifacts down there

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.890 
artifacts a million artifacts down there
and<00:02:42.620> there's<00:02:43.519> no<00:02:43.640> question<00:02:44.090> we're<00:02:44.450> not<00:02:44.480> going

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
and there's no question we're not going

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.380 
and there's no question we're not going
to<00:02:44.989> pick<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.470> million<00:02:45.769> artifacts<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.269> has

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
to pick up a million artifacts so it has

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.860 
to pick up a million artifacts so it has
to<00:02:47.510> be<00:02:47.629> very<00:02:47.840> selective<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.760> think<00:02:50.209> some<00:02:50.750> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
to be very selective and I think some of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.849 
to be very selective and I think some of
the<00:02:50.989> wrecks<00:02:51.200> if<00:02:51.530> we<00:02:51.799> can't<00:02:53.170> recover<00:02:54.170> them<00:02:54.470> then

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
the wrecks if we can't recover them then

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.250 
the wrecks if we can't recover them then
we<00:02:55.040> simply<00:02:55.430> need<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:56.030> move<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.810> from<00:02:57.049> where

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
we simply need to move them from where

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.050 
we simply need to move them from where
they<00:02:57.379> are<00:02:57.409> certainly<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.400> artifacts<00:02:58.819> don't

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
they are certainly the artifacts don't

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.479 
they are certainly the artifacts don't
get<00:02:59.209> destroyed<00:02:59.569> and<00:03:00.379> we<00:03:00.650> need<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:01.010> survey<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
get destroyed and we need to survey the

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.729 
get destroyed and we need to survey the
wrecks<00:03:01.849> which<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.659> to<00:03:02.780> uncover<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.319> process

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
wrecks which is to uncover the process

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.369 
wrecks which is to uncover the process
to<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.639> the<00:03:04.790> archaeological<00:03:05.540> data<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.109> even

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
to get the archaeological data so even

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.399 
to get the archaeological data so even
if<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.650> decide<00:03:07.519> not<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.939> preserve<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
if you decide not to preserve the

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.550 
if you decide not to preserve the
artifacts<00:03:09.919> what<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.879> don't<00:03:11.090> lose<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
artifacts what you don't lose is the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.800 
artifacts what you don't lose is the
actual<00:03:13.010> history<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.909> boat<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.209> what<00:03:14.450> what

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
actual history of the boat of what what

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.879 
actual history of the boat of what what
is<00:03:14.930> underwater

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
is underwater

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.849 
is underwater
however<00:03:16.760> these<00:03:17.120> artifacts<00:03:17.780> are<00:03:18.019> in<00:03:18.200> danger<00:03:18.680> of

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
however these artifacts are in danger of

however these artifacts are in danger of
being<00:03:19.129> lost<00:03:19.250> with<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.329> wreckage<00:03:20.720> sitting

out of the year economic and
infrastructural<00:03:28.790> expansion<00:03:29.510> are<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.810> huge

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
infrastructural expansion are a huge

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.909 
infrastructural expansion are a huge
concern<00:03:31.540> problem<00:03:32.540> from<00:03:32.750> our<00:03:32.959> perspective<00:03:33.680> as

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
concern problem from our perspective as

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.129 
concern problem from our perspective as
they<00:03:34.699> tend<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.090> only<00:03:35.239> work<00:03:35.510> three<00:03:35.780> months<00:03:36.049> a

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
they tend to only work three months a

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.849 
they tend to only work three months a
year<00:03:36.169> and<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:38.150> port<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.720> port<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.290> which<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:39.829> a

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
year and a port is a port in which is a

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.899 
year and a port is a port in which is a
place<00:03:40.359> subject<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.449> lots<00:03:41.659> of<00:03:41.810> demands<00:03:42.169> and

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
place subject to lots of demands and

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.129 
place subject to lots of demands and
port<00:03:43.909> expansion<00:03:44.449> is<00:03:44.569> certainly<00:03:44.870> something

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
port expansion is certainly something

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.469 
port expansion is certainly something
that's<00:03:45.409> going<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.680> come<00:03:45.859> in<00:03:45.979> the<00:03:46.040> future<00:03:46.479> based

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
that's going to come in the future based

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.890 
that's going to come in the future based
on<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.780> current<00:03:48.139> will<00:03:48.319> process<00:03:49.540> those<00:03:50.540> wrecks

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
on the current will process those wrecks

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.180 
on the current will process those wrecks
that<00:03:51.049> are<00:03:51.260> currently<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.979> way<00:03:52.159> of<00:03:52.970> ships

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
that are currently in the way of ships

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.969 
that are currently in the way of ships
are<00:03:55.190> gonna<00:03:55.370> find<00:03:55.669> themselves<00:03:56.030> in<00:03:56.209> trouble<00:03:56.979> so

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
are gonna find themselves in trouble so

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.539 
are gonna find themselves in trouble so
we<00:03:58.159> would<00:03:58.310> like<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.519> see<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.900> progress

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
we would like to see the progress

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.610 
we would like to see the progress

gonna get a sense of pride and maybe put
some<00:04:16.280> pressure<00:04:16.489> on<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.849> politicians

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
some pressure on the politicians
