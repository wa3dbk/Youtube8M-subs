ballistic<00:00:34.600> vertical<00:00:34.989> movements<00:00:35.500> like<00:00:35.559> the

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
ballistic vertical movements like the

ballistic vertical movements like the
clean<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:36.820> press<00:00:37.150> or<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.540> snatch<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.320> so<00:00:38.680> the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
clean and press or the snatch and so the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.070 
clean and press or the snatch and so the
hypo<00:00:39.519> is<00:00:39.580> an<00:00:39.699> excellent<00:00:40.000> segue<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.540> give<00:00:40.809> to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
hypo is an excellent segue to give to

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.229 
hypo is an excellent segue to give to
mimic<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.650> lot<00:00:42.070> of<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.220> training<00:00:42.460> benefit<00:00:43.000> that

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
mimic a lot of the training benefit that

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.229 
mimic a lot of the training benefit that
those<00:00:43.390> two<00:00:43.600> lifts<00:00:44.230> provide<00:00:44.619> but<00:00:45.280> allows<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.180> to

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
those two lifts provide but allows it to

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.149 
those two lifts provide but allows it to
be<00:00:46.299> a<00:00:46.390> little<00:00:46.570> bit<00:00:46.690> technically<00:00:47.350> easier<00:00:47.739> so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
be a little bit technically easier so

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.020 
be a little bit technically easier so
what<00:00:48.280> I'm<00:00:48.339> going<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.489> do<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.729> I'm<00:00:48.850> going<00:00:48.940> to

the one hand I pole so here we go so I

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.670 
the one hand I pole so here we go so I
picked<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.909> bell<00:01:10.090> up<00:01:10.299> it's<00:01:11.259> basically

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
picked the bell up it's basically

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.050 
picked the bell up it's basically
pretending<00:01:12.430> like<00:01:12.520> you're<00:01:12.640> going<00:01:12.759> to<00:01:12.850> do<00:01:12.970> the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
pretending like you're going to do the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.580 
pretending like you're going to do the
swing<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.600> I'll<00:01:14.140> renew<00:01:14.350> was<00:01:16.380> pulling<00:01:17.380> the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
swing and I'll renew was pulling the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.310 
swing and I'll renew was pulling the
bell<00:01:17.830> as<00:01:18.460> we<00:01:18.700> extend<00:01:19.000> our<00:01:19.150> hips<00:01:19.360> drive<00:01:20.080> into

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
bell as we extend our hips drive into

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.200 
bell as we extend our hips drive into
the<00:01:20.410> heels<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:21.250> should<00:01:21.430> almost<00:01:21.580> have<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> sense

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
the heels it should almost have a sense

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.440 
the heels it should almost have a sense
of<00:01:22.480> being<00:01:23.470> weightless<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.700> then<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.150> have<00:01:25.300> to

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
of being weightless and then we have to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.730 
of being weightless and then we have to
make<00:01:25.630> sure<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.890> get<00:01:27.070> our<00:01:27.130> hips<00:01:27.570> back<00:01:28.570> down<00:01:28.870> fast

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
make sure we get our hips back down fast

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.770 
make sure we get our hips back down fast
enough<00:01:29.950> should<00:01:30.790> feel<00:01:31.000> weightless<00:01:31.180> up<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.570> top

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
enough should feel weightless up the top

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.380 
enough should feel weightless up the top
and<00:01:32.110> then<00:01:32.440> run<00:01:32.620> your<00:01:32.650> hips<00:01:33.040> back<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.460> now<00:01:33.940> much

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
and then run your hips back and now much

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.510 
and then run your hips back and now much
like<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:34.750> do<00:01:34.870> in<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> swing<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.370> is<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
like we do in the swing so that is a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.190 
like we do in the swing so that is a
two-handed<00:01:37.000> Highfill<00:01:37.360> all<00:01:37.780> I'm<00:01:37.900> going<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.080> do

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
two-handed Highfill all I'm going to do

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.320 
two-handed Highfill all I'm going to do
is<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.500> switch<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.040> do<00:01:39.370> what<00:01:39.640> one-handed<00:01:40.210> hi

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
is to switch and do what one-handed hi

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.060 
is to switch and do what one-handed hi
pulling<00:01:40.600> out<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:40.870> you<00:01:40.960> can<00:01:41.080> see<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.500> little<00:01:41.920> bit

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
pulling out so you can see a little bit

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.190 
pulling out so you can see a little bit
different<00:01:42.460> perspective<00:01:43.210> again<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.050> little

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
different perspective again a little

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.510 
different perspective again a little
more<00:01:44.409> demanding<00:01:44.830> because<00:01:44.979> there's<00:01:45.280> going<00:01:45.460> to

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
more demanding because there's going to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.370 
more demanding because there's going to
be<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.640> torsion<00:01:46.360> or<00:01:46.420> torquing<00:01:46.870> demand<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.290> the

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
be a torsion or torquing demand on the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.230 
be a torsion or torquing demand on the
trunk<00:01:47.620> so<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.310> have<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.490> be<00:01:48.670> strong<00:01:49.210> to

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
trunk so you really have to be strong to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.850 
trunk so you really have to be strong to
the<00:01:49.420> trunk<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.840> be<00:01:49.960> stable<00:01:50.320> do<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.500> one<00:01:50.650> hand

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
the trunk and be stable do the one hand

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:02.440 
the trunk and be stable do the one hand
a<00:01:50.920> hypo<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.670> here's<00:01:51.850> what<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.060> looks<00:01:52.240> like

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.910 

so<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> quick<00:02:03.780> demo<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.530> two-handed

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
so that's a quick demo of the two-handed

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100 
so that's a quick demo of the two-handed
hi<00:02:05.040> pull<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.370> one<00:02:05.550> hand<00:02:05.790> hypo<00:02:06.150> thing<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
hi pull on one hand hypo thing you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
hi pull on one hand hypo thing you
really<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.530> get<00:02:08.100> through<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.399> head<00:02:08.429> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
really want to get through your head on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
really want to get through your head on
this<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> got<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> hips<00:02:09.600> back

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this is you got to get the hips back

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.930 
this is you got to get the hips back
early<00:02:10.200> hips<00:02:10.740> they're<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.100> get<00:02:11.790> your

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
early hips they're going to get your

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280 
early hips they're going to get your
center<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.240> gravity<00:02:12.300> back<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.020> can<00:02:13.110> really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
center of gravity back so you can really

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.809 
center of gravity back so you can really
catch<00:02:13.530> yourself<00:02:13.740> you're<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> get

your back another thing you always have

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.480 
your back another thing you always have
to<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.840> use<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> simple<00:02:19.470> Newton's<00:02:20.010> laws<00:02:20.220> is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
to know is use a simple Newton's laws is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.930 
to know is use a simple Newton's laws is
that<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.930> comes<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.350> must<00:02:22.380> come<00:02:22.650> down

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
that what comes up must come down

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.710 
that what comes up must come down
gravity's<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.120> pull<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.330> build<00:02:24.570> outs
