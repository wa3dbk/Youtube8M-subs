00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.439
 in this video we will show you a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.530
 property that satisfies the exponential 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.760
 complex something that we already know for the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 case of real numbers secret and w are 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.710
 complex numbers high az + w is 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.929
 equal to high z per elevated aw 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.619
 for this we are going to develop 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:30.930
 the second member of equality and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.090
 let's see that you get the first 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:39.240
 member of equality 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 elevated z by ^ w 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.190
 by definition of the exponential 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.280
 complex high az would be the sum 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.079
 of this in equal to zero to infinity 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.519
 of z elevated an n factorial match 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.920
 and this for the high w that 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:04.320
 definition of the complex exponential the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:10.330
 sum of this n equal to zero up 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.590
 infinite in this case w ^ n match 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.649
 in the factor and to 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.009
 then observe that we have a product 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.979
 of series but with a particularity 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.229
 for these series that these series both 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.229
 they are absolutely 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 converging 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.210
 and when this happens the product of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.640
 series can be calculated using the form 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.680
 of series car product 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 absolutely convergent we can 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.210
 use 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 shape 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 of the car product 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 and to do this by the form of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.000
 product of cachi this would be 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.640
 this remembers that it is for being 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.990
 absolutely convergent sum 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.740
 test n equals zero to infinity and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.440
 now for each n we would have the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.840
 summation until reaching an 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.390
 for each n for him equal to 0 for in 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:26.310
 equal to 1 for the matched of this 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.310
 equal to 0 until you reach that nd 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:38.750
 this with 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:41.150
 the index and z ^ and factorial match 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.050
 and now it has to be fulfilled that what 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.570
 let's put here with w 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.620
 the exponent and what we put here in 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.290
 the denominator with him and add then 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.770
 we have put z high and the exponent of 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.850
 w why 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.790
 and this exponent adds if to subtract the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.520
 and add n 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.220
 and the same thing we do below 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.280
 n less and factorial 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.870
 perfect and now what we are going to do is 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.950
 work a little what we have here 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.610
 in 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.390
 n equal to zero to infinity we leave a 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.580
 hollow to iu because we're going to write something 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.400
 that does not depend on iu and that we're going to 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.590
 add here the first thing you notice that 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.760
 we have if we multiply the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.540
 denominators and factorial by n less 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.670
 i 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.700
 factory 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.500
 good and I'm not referring the unit 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.980
 imaginary maybe I should have 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.620
 caught jota let's put you want jota 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:52.790
 jota jota jota yj 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.209
 and j &amp; j 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.510
 well then we have factorial n 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.610
 j factory are 13 sun reminds us of a 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.040
 combinatorial number 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.570
 if we had a n factorial here 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.550
 this is in the factorial match photo 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.520
 factorial in the factorial j minus this 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.310
 it's n about j but of course for that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.829
 I need to have a factorial n 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.829
 factorial that we add here for the face 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.130
 and the series would come 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.590
 if that is going to be and here 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.640
 let's see we do not put 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.640
 to which the series 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.840
 so 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.840
 j Factorial factory nj down 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.340
 we complete with n factorial but of course 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.360
 this in the factor already put by the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.770
 face then you have to share with 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.830
 compensate with 1 match in the factorial 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.430
 but note that here you add up with respect 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.960
 de jota yn does not depend on jota what it is on 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.960
 factorial can take it out 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.889
 with that we have already concluded with the 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.770
 factorial 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:20.310
 and now simply because we would have z 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.310
 high j by w ^ n j 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.870
 then we would have summation of this n 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.139
 equal to zero is infinite of 1 match 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.999
 in the yang factor 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.999
 and now we would have 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:46.539
 j equal to zero to nn about jzj w 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.419
 ^ n - j this sounds like something to you because it must 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.720
 sound t this is the formula of the binomial 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.980
 newton 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.930
 zyw with mutates with the product because the 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.000
 product of complex numbers satisfies 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.430
 the commutative property and therefore 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.370
 what we have put here is the formula 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:09.800
 of binomial of newton for z more w ^ n 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.050
 then this would simply be 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.360
 sum of this in and equal to zero 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.360
 to infinity 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.530
 z more w ^ in the party at the factory 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.569
 but if we remember the definition of 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.270
 complex exponential 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:35.449
 this is z plus w elevated n match in a 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.690
 factor and then this is look as we have 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.050
 written raised to z or elevated w that's not 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.240
 is more than elevated to z plus w and with this 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.120
 the property that 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:52.030
 we raised high z by high w is 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.030
 the likud equals high z plus w
