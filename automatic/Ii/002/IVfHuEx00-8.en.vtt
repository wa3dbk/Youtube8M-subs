00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
certain way I don't have that installed

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
certain way I don't have that installed
yet<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.659> I'll<00:02:03.810> show<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.229> guys

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
yet but I will and I'll show you guys

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.800 
yet but I will and I'll show you guys
how<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.860> make<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.009> work<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.600> also

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
how I can make that work and it also

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
how I can make that work and it also
allows<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.860> keep<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.099> without<00:02:08.550> having

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
allows you to keep going without having

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
allows you to keep going without having
to<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.979> press

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
to actually press

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.560 
to actually press
button<00:02:11.410> which<00:02:11.530> means<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.010> want<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.310> like

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
button which means if you want to like

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.390 
button which means if you want to like
transport<00:02:13.570> off<00:02:13.690> into<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.960> certain<00:02:14.590> direction

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
transport off into a certain direction

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.960 
transport off into a certain direction
while<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.240> go<00:02:16.600> use<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.110> restroom<00:02:17.970> which

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
while you go use the restroom which

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.790 
while you go use the restroom which
would<00:02:19.360> be<00:02:19.480> entirely<00:02:19.810> possible<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.650> could

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
would be entirely possible you could

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.790 
would be entirely possible you could
just<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.220> ahead<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.430> launch<00:02:22.210> yourself<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.870> go

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
just go ahead and launch yourself and go

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.930 
just go ahead and launch yourself and go
use<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:23.980> restroom<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.490> as<00:02:24.610> long<00:02:24.700> as<00:02:24.880> you

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
use the restroom and as long as you

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.160 
use the restroom and as long as you
chose<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> right<00:02:25.360> track<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.810> should<00:02:25.990> get

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
chose the right track you should get

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.170 
chose the right track you should get
roughly<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.710> where<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.100> want<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.340> go<00:02:27.490> without

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
roughly to where you want to go without

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.760 
roughly to where you want to go without
having<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.750> deal<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:28.960> pressing<00:02:29.380> all<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
having to deal with pressing all the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.980 
having to deal with pressing all the
buttons<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:31.240> that's<00:02:31.450> pretty<00:02:31.630> much<00:02:31.780> how<00:02:31.960> the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
buttons so that's pretty much how the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.330 
buttons so that's pretty much how the
system<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.620> work<00:02:32.740> right<00:02:32.980> now<00:02:33.040> it's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
system is going to work right now it's

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.910 
system is going to work right now it's
just<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.580> loop<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.050> can<00:02:35.170> see<00:02:35.350> I'm<00:02:35.470> already

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
just a loop as you can see I'm already

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.410 
just a loop as you can see I'm already
back<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.640> start<00:02:37.260> point<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:39.420> but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
back to the start point right here but

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.660 
back to the start point right here but
in<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> future<00:02:41.280> hopefully<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.490> near

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
in the future hopefully in the near

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.330 
in the future hopefully in the near
future<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.209> will<00:02:43.390> encompass<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:44.770> entire<00:02:44.800> map

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
future it will encompass the entire map

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.400 
future it will encompass the entire map
