00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
which personally I kind of like it I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840

like<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> crazy<00:02:04.829> stuff<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> just

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
like all the crazy stuff because it just

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.029 
like all the crazy stuff because it just
adds<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.270> lot<00:02:06.479> more<00:02:06.689> variety<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.500> game<00:02:07.770> and

adds a lot more variety to the game and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.130 
adds a lot more variety to the game and
wouldn't<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.879> funny<00:02:09.209> watching<00:02:09.569> someone

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
wouldn't it be funny watching someone

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.650 
wouldn't it be funny watching someone
you<00:02:10.739> know<00:02:10.890> come<00:02:11.220> in

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
you know come in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.210 
you know come in
matchmaker<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.350> something<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.040> that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
matchmaker is something they have that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.280 
matchmaker is something they have that
horn<00:02:13.580> poking<00:02:14.000> out<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.390> wonder<00:02:15.020> if<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.140> can

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
horn poking out I wonder if you can

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.870 
horn poking out I wonder if you can
actually<00:02:15.440> shoot<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.580> hit<00:02:16.760> because

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
actually shoot that and get hit because

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.610 
actually shoot that and get hit because
that<00:02:17.090> may<00:02:17.240> be<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.390> disadvantage<00:02:17.840> what<00:02:18.500> if

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
that may be a disadvantage what if

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.020 
that may be a disadvantage what if
you're<00:02:18.740> hiding<00:02:19.100> behind<00:02:19.220> something<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
you're hiding behind something and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.850 
you're hiding behind something and
you're<00:02:20.420> able<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.720> shoot<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.140> horn<00:02:21.500> part

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
you're able to shoot that horn part

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.210 
you're able to shoot that horn part
that's<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:22.760> sticking<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.330> from<00:02:23.570> the
