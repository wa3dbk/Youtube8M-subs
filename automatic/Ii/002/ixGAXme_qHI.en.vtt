reporter I knew in 1980 that the US
government<00:04:48.200> was<00:04:48.230> hiding<00:04:48.890> something

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340

something<00:04:49.370> big<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:51.080> at<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.290> time<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:52.070> too

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
something big but at that time I too

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.570 
something big but at that time I too
believed<00:04:53.210> that<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.780> return<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.590> gold<00:04:54.800> money<00:04:55.100> was

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
believed that a return to gold money was

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.600 
believed that a return to gold money was
a<00:04:55.610> good<00:04:55.820> thing<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.180> do<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:57.470> took<00:04:57.740> me<00:04:57.800> 15<00:04:58.190> years

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
a good thing to do it took me 15 years

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.210 
a good thing to do it took me 15 years
to<00:04:59.150> figure<00:04:59.480> out<00:04:59.720> that<00:04:59.990> gold<00:05:00.320> was<00:05:00.650> not<00:05:00.980> the

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
to figure out that gold was not the

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.000 
to figure out that gold was not the
solution<00:05:01.450> especially<00:05:02.450> because<00:05:03.170> we<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.770> US

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
solution especially because we the US

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.720 
solution especially because we the US
government<00:05:04.490> probably<00:05:05.060> owned<00:05:05.570> no<00:05:05.960> gold<00:05:06.730> it's
