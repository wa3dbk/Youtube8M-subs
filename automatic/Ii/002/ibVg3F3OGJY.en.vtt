00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.900 
itself is going to look good so I know
that's<00:01:08.350> pretty<00:01:08.530> important<00:01:09.100> when<00:01:09.340> somebody's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
that's pretty important when somebody's

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.000

purchasing a case as you can see on this

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.400 
purchasing a case as you can see on this
side<00:01:12.280> just<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.240> know<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.660> case<00:01:13.840> covers<00:01:14.230> the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
side just you know the case covers the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.220 
side just you know the case covers the
entire<00:01:14.680> side<00:01:15.040> so<00:01:15.760> if<00:01:16.120> you<00:01:16.390> are<00:01:16.660> somebody<00:01:17.050> that

with

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
with

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.900 
with
this<00:02:16.730> case<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.210> is<00:02:17.270> an<00:02:17.870> ultra-thin<00:02:18.380> case<00:02:18.910> they

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
this case it is an ultra-thin case they

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.930 
this case it is an ultra-thin case they
measured<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.540> under<00:02:21.200> 1<00:02:21.560> millimeter<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.670> is

measured is under 1 millimeter it is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.140 
measured is under 1 millimeter it is
really<00:02:23.510> thin<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> nice<00:02:25.220> sturdy<00:02:25.819> plastic

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
really thin it is a nice sturdy plastic

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.820 
really thin it is a nice sturdy plastic
so<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:27.020> know<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.380> protect<00:02:27.709> it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
so you know it's going to protect it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.120 
so you know it's going to protect it
against<00:02:28.040> scratches<00:02:28.610> but<00:02:29.319> if<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.590> notice<00:02:30.890> this

protection this comes with a screen
protector<00:03:10.280> which<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.060> great<00:03:11.360> in<00:03:12.170> my

particular<00:03:12.860> case<00:03:13.130> I've<00:03:13.459> got<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.820> Stein<00:03:14.360> dial<00:03:14.600> a

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
particular case I've got a Stein dial a

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.900 
particular case I've got a Stein dial a
screen<00:03:15.830> protector<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.519> one<00:03:16.700> which

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
screen protector on this one which

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.580 
screen protector on this one which
provides<00:03:17.450> me<00:03:17.600> with<00:03:17.630> in<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.959> nice<00:03:18.260> matte

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
provides me with in that nice matte

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.050 
provides me with in that nice matte
finish<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.330> does<00:03:20.510> come<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:20.780> one<00:03:21.140> and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
finish but it does come with one and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.880 
finish but it does come with one and
overall<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.360> really<00:03:23.810> like<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.530> case<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.820> a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
overall I really like this case it is a

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.789 
overall I really like this case it is a
very<00:03:27.940> small<00:03:28.940> very<00:03:29.390> thin<00:03:29.780> form<00:03:30.140> factor<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:30.739> it

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
very small very thin form factor so it

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.530 
very small very thin form factor so it
doesn't<00:03:31.160> add<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.310> lot<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.519> bulk<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:32.000> your<00:03:32.030> iPhone
