leave<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:36.330> alone<00:01:37.100> since<00:01:38.100> I'm<00:01:38.280> making<00:01:38.400> extra

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
leave that alone since I'm making extra

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.610 
leave that alone since I'm making extra
long<00:01:39.180> fringe<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.780> found<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.380> helpful

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
long fringe I found it's really helpful

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.200

to just lay it across the back of the
sofa<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.440> work<00:01:43.620> from<00:01:43.800> there<00:01:44.070> so

sofa and then you can work from there so
all<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:45.000> doing<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.480> is<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.750> loosening<00:01:46.409> up

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
all I'm doing here is just loosening up

all I'm doing here is just loosening up
the<00:01:46.680> several<00:01:47.010> pieces<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.790> five<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.570> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the several pieces you know five or so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
the several pieces you know five or so

pieces of thread the horizontal thread

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
pieces of thread the horizontal thread
that<00:01:51.150> we're<00:01:51.270> pulling<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that we're pulling out just kind of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
that we're pulling out just kind of
loosening<00:01:52.860> those<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.280> prepping<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.880> to

loosening those up prepping them to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
loosening those up prepping them to
remove<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.710> over<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.010> other

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
remove and then I go over to the other

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.850 
remove and then I go over to the other
side<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.760> do<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.180> same<00:01:57.270> exact<00:01:57.840> thing<00:01:57.930> just

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
side and do the same exact thing just

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.230 
side and do the same exact thing just
loosen<00:01:59.220> up<00:01:59.310> several<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.700> those<00:01:59.820> pieces<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
loosen up several of those pieces and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
loosen up several of those pieces and
I'll<00:02:00.630> catch<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.440> middle<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.250> at

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
I'll catch it in the middle just one at

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
I'll catch it in the middle just one at
a<00:02:02.430> time<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.909> pull<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:04.020> from<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.380> middle

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
a time and pull right from the middle

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.860 
a time and pull right from the middle
and<00:02:04.890> since<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.820> already<00:02:06.000> loosened<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.600> several

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
and since we already loosened up several

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.139 
and since we already loosened up several
pieces<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> sides<00:02:07.979> they're<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.640> ready<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
pieces on the sides they're all ready to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.699 
pieces on the sides they're all ready to
go<00:02:09.299> so<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.659> just<00:02:09.869> keep<00:02:10.110> pulling<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
go so you can just keep pulling from the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.800 
go so you can just keep pulling from the
center<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.190> by<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:11.760> pull<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.269> out

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
center one by one and pull them all out

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.009 
center one by one and pull them all out
and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.890> comes<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.120> short<00:02:15.480> with

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
and then when it comes to the short with

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.440 
and then when it comes to the short with
that's<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.430> easy<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:17.970> all<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.240> have<00:02:18.360> to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that's really easy because all I have to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
that's really easy because all I have to
do<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.720> catch<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.140> few<00:02:19.350> pieces<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.160> thread

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
do is catch a few pieces of the thread

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.949 
do is catch a few pieces of the thread
on<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:20.670> side<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
on one side one and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.780 
on one side one and
and<00:02:22.049> just<00:02:22.560> keep<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:22.829> pullin<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.459> they<00:02:23.609> pull

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
and just keep on pullin and they pull

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.039 
and just keep on pullin and they pull
out<00:02:23.909> really<00:02:24.299> easy<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> thread

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
out really easy because the thread

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.690 
out really easy because the thread
doesn't<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.530> travel<00:02:25.950> through<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.549> much

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700

doesn't have to travel through very much
fabric<00:02:27.140> once<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.409> your<00:02:28.500> fringe<00:02:28.799> the

fabric once you have your fringe the
length<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.609> want<00:02:29.819> you're<00:02:30.090> going<00:02:30.209> to

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
length that you want you're going to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.880 
length that you want you're going to
break<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.629> into<00:02:30.840> sections<00:02:31.109> so<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:31.680> taking

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
break it up into sections so I'm taking

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
break it up into sections so I'm taking
mine<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.519> small<00:02:33.120> kind<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.540> half<00:02:33.750> inch<00:02:34.049> sections

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
mine in small kind of half inch sections

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.920 
mine in small kind of half inch sections
and<00:02:34.890> I'm<00:02:35.340> tying<00:02:35.609> an<00:02:35.730> overhand<00:02:35.790> knot<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and I'm tying an overhand knot and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.349 
and I'm tying an overhand knot and
snugging<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.739> knot<00:02:37.920> right<00:02:38.159> up<00:02:38.639> to<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.239> edge

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
snugging the knot right up to the edge

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.000 
snugging the knot right up to the edge
of<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.689> fabric<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.349> locks<00:02:40.500> everything

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
of the fabric so it locks everything

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.940 
of the fabric so it locks everything
into<00:02:41.189> place<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.579> there's<00:02:41.760> no<00:02:41.939> loose<00:02:42.209> ends<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
into place so there's no loose ends and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.830 
into place so there's no loose ends and
just<00:02:43.950> continue<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.370> all<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.909> way<00:02:45.120> across<00:02:45.599> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
just continue on all the way across the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.330 
just continue on all the way across the
bottom<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.290> fabric<00:02:46.680> around<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:47.099> sides

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
bottom of your fabric around the sides

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220 
bottom of your fabric around the sides
I'm<00:02:47.639> doing<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.939> sides<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.359> well<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I'm doing the sides as well so just

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.649 
I'm doing the sides as well so just
overhand<00:02:50.159> knots<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.639> all<00:02:50.969> of<00:02:51.299> those<00:02:51.420> little

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
overhand knots on all of those little

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.750 
overhand knots on all of those little
half<00:02:51.870> inch<00:02:51.900> sections<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.739> Fringe<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.459> then

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
half inch sections of Fringe and then

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.949 
half inch sections of Fringe and then
once<00:02:53.970> you're<00:02:54.150> done<00:02:54.180> we're<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.599> move<00:02:54.659> on

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
once you're done we're going to move on

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.949 
once you're done we're going to move on
to<00:02:55.169> the<00:02:55.650> second<00:02:56.099> row<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.310> knots<00:02:56.669> to<00:02:57.629> make<00:02:57.780> our

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
to the second row of knots to make our

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.539 
to the second row of knots to make our
second<00:02:58.409> row<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.650> knots<00:02:58.829> we're<00:02:59.129> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> split

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
second row of knots we're going to split

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.149 
second row of knots we're going to split
each<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.269> those<00:03:00.450> bits<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.900> Fringe<00:03:01.169> in<00:03:01.470> half<00:03:01.799> and

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
each of those bits of Fringe in half and

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.059 
each of those bits of Fringe in half and
tie<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.700> two<00:03:03.060> halves<00:03:03.359> together<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.739> can

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
tie the two halves together so you can

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.559 
tie the two halves together so you can
see<00:03:05.099> here<00:03:05.459> there's<00:03:05.939> just<00:03:06.030> two<00:03:06.299> halves

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
see here there's just two halves
