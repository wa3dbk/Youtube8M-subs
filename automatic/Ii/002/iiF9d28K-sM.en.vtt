okay<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.740> veins<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.399> that<00:00:02.520> we're<00:00:02.820> going

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay this is veins and that we're going

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.970 
okay this is veins and that we're going
to<00:00:03.090> go<00:00:03.240> from<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.570> bottom<00:00:03.899> or<00:00:04.080> because<00:00:04.740> that's

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
to go from the bottom or because that's

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.009 
to go from the bottom or because that's
the<00:00:05.220> way<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.759> blood<00:00:06.000> goes<00:00:06.240> back<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.230> heart

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
the way the blood goes back to the heart

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.230 
the way the blood goes back to the heart
and<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.170> have<00:00:11.059> dorsal<00:00:12.139> metatarsal<00:00:13.139> veins

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
and we have dorsal metatarsal veins

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.650 
and we have dorsal metatarsal veins
sorry<00:00:15.240> dorsal<00:00:15.839> digit<00:00:16.350> two<00:00:16.500> veins<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:17.660> then

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
sorry dorsal digit two veins first then

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.200 
sorry dorsal digit two veins first then
going<00:00:18.990> superiorly<00:00:19.710> dorsal<00:00:20.550> metatarsal<00:00:21.359> veins

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
have the lateral marginal vein which

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.350 
have the lateral marginal vein which
appears<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.520> no<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.670> doesn't<00:00:38.969> quite<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.329> to

the plunge of the foot on the medial
side<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> medial<00:00:44.550> marginal<00:00:45.329> vein

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
side you have the medial marginal vein

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.779 
side you have the medial marginal vein
here<00:00:47.270> which<00:00:48.270> extends<00:00:49.129> superiorly<00:00:50.129> and

comes<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> question<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
comes all the way up the question is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.340 
comes all the way up the question is
where<00:01:01.230> does<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> become<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:03.019> great<00:01:04.019> long

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
where does it become this great long

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
where does it become this great long
city<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:04.920> been<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.360> must<00:01:06.600> be

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
city that's been here so this must be

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.010 
city that's been here so this must be
suffering<00:01:07.049> us<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> must<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.510> suffice

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
suffering us so this must be suffice

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.240 
suffering us so this must be suffice
long<00:01:10.640> long<00:01:11.840> wait<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.350> must<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.619> great<00:01:13.979> or

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
long long wait this must be great or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.899 
long long wait this must be great or
long<00:01:15.350> saphenous<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.909> superficial

long saphenous this one and superficial
communicating<00:01:21.720> veins<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> yeah<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
communicating veins and so yeah it's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.990 
communicating veins and so yeah it's
labeled<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.400> great<00:01:29.909> long<00:01:30.150> saphenous<00:01:30.960> vein

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
labeled here great long saphenous vein

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.149 
labeled here great long saphenous vein
comes<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> way<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.210> femoral<00:01:36.479> vein

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
comes all the way up to the femoral vein

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.889 
comes all the way up to the femoral vein
then<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> branches<00:01:38.520> into<00:01:40.759> various

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
then it branches into various

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.789 
then it branches into various

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
superficial lymph nodes here we haven't

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230 
superficial lymph nodes here we haven't
really<00:02:01.110> caught<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.530> those<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.040> thence<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
really caught at those and thence the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.429 
really caught at those and thence the
there's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> dotted<00:02:04.259> one<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:06.439> gia

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
there's a dotted one here which is gia

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.199 
there's a dotted one here which is gia
can<00:02:07.799> Mini's<00:02:09.440> gia<00:02:10.440> Khomeini's<00:02:10.950> vein<00:02:11.220> variable

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
can Mini's gia Khomeini's vein variable

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.020 
can Mini's gia Khomeini's vein variable
so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.750 
so
perhaps<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.330> isn't<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.720> everybody<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:14.950> would

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
perhaps that isn't in everybody I would

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.780 
perhaps that isn't in everybody I would
suggest<00:02:17.010> -<00:02:18.010> posterior<00:02:18.520> oh<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:21.520> is<00:02:22.560> okay<00:02:23.790> so

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
suggest - posterior oh there is okay so

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
suggest - posterior oh there is okay so
on<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.970> posterior<00:02:25.330> aspect<00:02:25.920> starting<00:02:26.920> from

on the posterior aspect starting from

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.030 
on the posterior aspect starting from
the<00:02:27.130> bottom<00:02:27.459> again<00:02:28.140> we've<00:02:29.140> got<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.560> smoke

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the bottom again we've got the smoke

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.479 
the bottom again we've got the smoke
this<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.900> small<00:02:31.900> or<00:02:32.260> short<00:02:32.489> saphenous

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
this is the small or short saphenous

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.080 
this is the small or short saphenous
vein<00:02:33.880> as<00:02:34.319> asked<00:02:35.319> by<00:02:35.470> Mike<00:02:35.739> for<00:02:36.700> us<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.000> in

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
vein as asked by Mike for us to do in

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.410 
vein as asked by Mike for us to do in
the<00:02:37.180> self-directed<00:02:37.630> study<00:02:38.020> this<00:02:38.410> week<00:02:38.680> and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the self-directed study this week and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.540 
the self-directed study this week and
you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.450> see<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.959> has<00:02:42.150> branches<00:02:43.150> off<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.550> then

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
you can see it has branches off it then

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.790 
you can see it has branches off it then
it<00:02:45.700> carries<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.420> superiorly<00:02:46.989> until<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.530> comes

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
it carries on superiorly until it comes

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.650 
it carries on superiorly until it comes
to<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:49.320> popliteal<00:02:50.320> fossa<00:02:50.560> area<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.660> the

to the popliteal fossa area and the
popliteal<00:02:53.110> vein<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.590> marked<00:02:53.890> here<00:02:53.980> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
popliteal vein is marked here and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.190 
popliteal vein is marked here and
there's<00:02:54.700> an<00:02:54.760> opening<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.630> chloral

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
there's an opening in the chloral

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.170 
there's an opening in the chloral
fasciae<00:02:57.720> right<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:01.959> it
