00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.509
 I'll call you back with one 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.759
 new comments back and there today 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.630
 it's a new episode of ask me 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.460
 everything 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.020
 I think that means that or you have 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.820
 me now so criticized that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.230
 I pronounced that wrong 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.269
 that now came to the conclusion 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 that's what must be called anything 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.779
 I'm not sure if that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.220
 It's true, but I think so 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'm sure that will get back to me 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 comments in and today I answer 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 times your questions you me under the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
 last video and I have to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 I 've been asking these questions for two 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.500
 I do not look at it for weeks, I know 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.210
 So not what is coming here for me 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 it will be very spontaneous 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.899
 if you want that the prepared 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.460
 that I really ask the questions again 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.410
 cook and write down what I am then 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 say then write me like that in the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.559
 comments but I think then will 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.329
 not quite as fun anymore 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.590
 it's much more spontaneous 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.120
 hopefully a little funnier too 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.199
 and let's start with the first one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.239
 ask 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.430
 and that's what you would be first 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.879
 fix if you had the power in the br 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.460
 4 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.590
 First, I have the power I have with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.210
 Padawan 1 you really think 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 nothing stuck there 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 but you have thought wrong of course 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.119
 only flows through my whole body 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.650
 this is what I do and what I do first 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.840
 it would of course fix that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729
 netcode that is still the moment 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.439
 biggest problem in battlefield 4 and when 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.150
 the fixed is then the rest is 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.680
 no problem so I would me 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.090
 Of course, then we think and we do 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.310
 continue with the next question 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.490
 and that is you want in next 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.380
 synonymous time to make a display 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.850
 No, I will not let's play first 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 I did a let's play offs 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.140
 channel even i think there is mike west 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.909
 lp but the whole thing was not real 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.439
 I did not succeed in that either 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.820
 really fun and the videos 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.009
 frankly, they were pretty 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 bad and for better videos i have 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.220
 at the moment not so the time I do yes 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 already the comments and the attempts 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.060
 I make just as good as possible and as 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.710
 is already so much time on it that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 I do not have time for 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.159
 I also want a last channel where I am 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 synonymous again make good videos and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.649
 if he unfortunately will in the near future 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.750
 do not come 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.149
 let's go on and there's why 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 did you start with youtube that is 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.000
 actually a pretty good question 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 I can also answer quickly 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 and I used to have a blog 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 where I wrote about gaming 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.340
 have 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.930
 Mostly it was still about call of duty 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.180
 and there I have more often times article 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.319
 written or any opinions 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.659
 Actually, what a comment 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.250
 at that time it was only in writing and stopped 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.930
 the whole thing was just so so 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.340
 no one has succeeded 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.290
 I can also read through 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.629
 would like to read through it if that too 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.799
 as a video form gives me so then 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.329
 have come to think 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.859
 I'm starting now time to make time I 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.390
 Comments I'm doing this, so to speak 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.790
 same thing in the blog 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.079
 have now in video form and I have 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.519
 then stop and then this is 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.260
 channel emerged there then 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.639
 I changed several times at the beginning 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.379
 as I said quite normal topics 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.970
 comments made then I have 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.739
 in between, everything possible 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.170
 made times and today it works 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.269
 stop mostly at battlefield being that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.190
 here as this 18 years, of course 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.840
 again just a topic comment 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.489
 how is a bit freestyle moderately 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.319
 I also like that stuff 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 So I really mean everything 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 Hope you like it so far it is running 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.750
 really good and far away he looks 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.939
 Something else is asked here we have 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.430
 a long question which was your first 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.370
 Play that is really a good question 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.230
 I think it was at that time fully pitt was 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.049
 that was really one on the pc 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.359
 under windows 98 such a game had to be there 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.250
 you kinda 2d jump'n'run moderately somehow 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.290
 I do not know if the 1 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.730
 maybe some of you from jim first 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.810
 What does that say was a game like that? 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.519
 it used to be once 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.199
 I believe these two games 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.829
 I played first of all 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.599
 other 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.069
 I have that only on the pc of 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.470
 my father made as me maybe 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.629
 just no idea 89 years old 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.400
 indeed was at that time I had 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.690
 no own pc that was also 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.340
 a little different times I think 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.739
 I have my first pc with somehow 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.209
 It was twelve years ago 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.889
 really a little different 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.169
 meanwhile has filled somehow 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.699
 the 37 year old already has his own pc 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.229
 the times have already been there 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.319
 changed a bit I'm grad though 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.849
 first 21 but still that is one 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.379
 I just had to have another time 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.639
 say so although it also not yet 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.440
 was so long ago 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.000
 why did you start with youtube? 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.010
 I have already answered why 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.079
 Do not you play a call of duty anymore 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.180
 is also a very good question and that 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.979
 I simply do not have black ops 2 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.260
 more so the motivation I did 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.849
 I've bought black ops 2 the whole 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.739
 I also have a lot of fun at the beginning 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.020
 made but somewhere came this one 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.940
 point where I just do not bother anymore 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.430
 had on it and have since this point 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.960
 I do not do this whole series anymore 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.880
 I have not got a big one anymore 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.190
 bought and I just like that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.449
 meanwhile so uninteresting 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.560
 that I no longer demand that 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.180
 have to play that 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.680
 I am now complete with battlefield 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.139
 satisfied yes I like it too 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.880
 battlefield 4 actually to therefore 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.289
 I've changed I am very 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.479
 satisfied with this decision and 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.070
 also since i play on the pc i 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.199
 ' ve Last year still on the console 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.400
 I do not dare play either 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.229
 More really such a call of duty 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.729
 because it is there again 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.410
 somehow everything different than on the 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.020
 console and that's why I have that 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.599
 what is laid to the files, so to speak 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.280
 your favorite game yes at the moment games 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.479
 I like battlefield 4 who 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.860
 would have thought that's probably mine 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.750
 current favorite game 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.370
 otherwise I find borderlands 2 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.620
 really very good i can do that 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.509
 really only recommend to everyone and 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.759
 my all time favorite game is 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.500
 maybe warhawk for the ps3 did that 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.570
 I just played that long and that 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.070
 was the first game that made me so 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.410
 bit in this multiplayer area 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.759
 has brought and therefore had to 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.470
 actually on diesel is on this 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.030
 list because it's easy on me 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.460
 I think it all took over 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.630
 I would never have played week then 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.710
 I would never synonymous with youtube 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.360
 then I would never have started 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.400
 started to play shooter then 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.110
 I never started with call of duty and 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.909
 never with battlefield and then there 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.740
 not the whole thing so where hok is on 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.570
 every game is quite important 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.030
 Fifth, what's your name 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.070
 names that I say unfortunately does not do 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.599
 I'm sorry and sixth much love yes 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.220
 thank you very much what should i say to that 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.300
 and we continue with the next one 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.070
 ask where do you live that I tell you 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.960
 I would like to stay in Münster right now 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.759
 I can not come here though 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.360
 come from Lower Saxony from near 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.669
 Hanover 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.620
 But I do not say more about it either 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.539
 I'm not telling you where I am exactly 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.940
 without afterwards one of you will be present 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.460
 my front door and we want that yes 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.659
 not all or I do not believe in it 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.310
 In any case, I can unfortunately do that for you 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.870
 do not answer more precisely I think that 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.090
 it is not that bad and i would say so 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.289
 we still ask a question and then 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.849
 Let's start with the next episode 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.889
 I do not want the whole thing again 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:26.280
 hold so long and the last question 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.289
 means means how many times do you go
