goes<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.150> 1080i

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
goes to 1080i

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:22.320 
goes to 1080i
there's<00:01:11.799> also<00:01:12.090> 720p<00:01:14.040> 480p<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:16.049> 480i<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:21.330> can

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
there's also 720p 480p and 480i so I can

there's also 720p 480p and 480i so I can
switch<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.369> these<00:01:24.720> obviously<00:01:25.720> have<00:01:25.899> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
switch this to these obviously have the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.800 
switch this to these obviously have the
optimal<00:01:26.470> resolution<00:01:27.040> here<00:01:27.460> at<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.640> top<00:01:27.850> it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
optimal resolution here at the top it

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.810 
optimal resolution here at the top it
does<00:01:29.020> not<00:01:29.170> go<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.440> 1080p<00:01:30.570> unfortunately<00:01:32.820> if

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
does not go to 1080p unfortunately if

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.600 
does not go to 1080p unfortunately if
you<00:01:34.450> switch<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:36.210> computer<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:38.429> you<00:01:39.429> want

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
you switch to the computer and you want

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.749 
you switch to the computer and you want
to<00:01:40.590> change<00:01:41.590> your<00:01:41.679> resolution<00:01:41.830> actually<00:01:42.610> goes

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
to change your resolution actually goes

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.310 
to change your resolution actually goes
to<00:01:42.789> 9<00:01:43.740> 1920<00:01:44.740> by<00:01:44.860> 1080<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.020> 5

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
to 9 1920 by 1080 there's a 5

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.830 
to 9 1920 by 1080 there's a 5
millisecond<00:01:48.039> response<00:01:48.700> time<00:01:49.300> so<00:01:49.330> that's

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
millisecond response time so that's

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.240 
millisecond response time so that's
basically<00:01:50.259> changing<00:01:50.890> from<00:01:51.420> pixel<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.509> pixel

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
basically changing from pixel to pixel

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.870 
basically changing from pixel to pixel

areas<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> color<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.629> little<00:02:31.720> off

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
areas and the color was a little off

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.339 
areas and the color was a little off
playing<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.120> slightly<00:02:34.120> above<00:02:34.450> me<00:02:34.840> and

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
playing with it slightly above me and

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.320 
playing with it slightly above me and
it's<00:02:35.650> probably<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.430> was<00:02:36.610> probably<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.000> foot

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
it's probably it was probably a foot

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's probably it was probably a foot
above<00:02:37.510> me

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
above me

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.399 
above me
it<00:02:39.610> also<00:02:39.730> has<00:02:39.939> true<00:02:40.209> sound<00:02:40.450> HD<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.049> true<00:02:41.200> sound

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
it also has true sound HD and true sound

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.589 
it also has true sound HD and true sound
volume<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.250> basically<00:02:42.610> means<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.540> don't

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
volume that basically means and I don't

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.199 
volume that basically means and I don't
use<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.049> for<00:02:44.079> this<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.849> were<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:48.090> excuse<00:02:49.090> me

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
use it for this if I were to excuse me

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.520 
use it for this if I were to excuse me
if<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.420> were<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:51.340> watching<00:02:51.700> TV<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:52.530> switch

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
if I were to be watching TV and switch

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.240 
if I were to be watching TV and switch
the<00:02:53.709> programming<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> commercial<00:02:57.129> or

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
the programming to a commercial or

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.589 
the programming to a commercial or
something<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.609> that<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.329> would

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
something like that it would

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.050 
something like that it would
automatically<00:02:59.230> adjust<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> volume<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.909> it's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
automatically adjust the volume so it's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.910 
automatically adjust the volume so it's
a<00:03:01.120> cool<00:03:01.299> function<00:03:01.629> I<00:03:01.930> don't<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
a cool function I don't really have a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.740 
a cool function I don't really have a
use<00:03:03.010> for<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.519> but<00:03:03.549> maybe<00:03:03.849> if<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.090> watching<00:03:04.480> TV

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
use for it but maybe if you watching TV

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.780 
use for it but maybe if you watching TV
on<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.319> smaller<00:03:05.620> screen<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.099> might<00:03:06.250> find<00:03:06.489> some

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
on a smaller screen you might find some

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.390 
on a smaller screen you might find some
use<00:03:06.939> for<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.209> as<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.170> 60<00:03:08.500> Hertz<00:03:08.530> refresh<00:03:09.099> time

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
use for it as the 60 Hertz refresh time

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.770 
use for it as the 60 Hertz refresh time
for<00:03:10.269> refresh<00:03:10.780> rate<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:12.220> uh<00:03:12.389> just<00:03:13.389> over

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
for refresh rate and it's uh just over

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.319 
for refresh rate and it's uh just over
ten<00:03:14.019> pounds<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:15.159> doesn't<00:03:15.639> actually<00:03:15.760> feel<00:03:16.030> that

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
ten pounds it doesn't actually feel that

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.080 
ten pounds it doesn't actually feel that
heavy<00:03:16.870> if<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:17.260> pick<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.470> up<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:20.579> if<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.879> plan

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
heavy if you pick it up but if you plan

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.819 
heavy if you pick it up but if you plan
on<00:03:22.120> moving<00:03:22.359> it<00:03:22.569> around<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.989> whole<00:03:23.170> bot<00:03:23.409> you

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
on moving it around a whole bot you

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.170 
on moving it around a whole bot you
won't<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.400> notice<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.879> weight<00:03:27.060> all<00:03:28.060> right

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
won't really notice the weight all right

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.720 
won't really notice the weight all right
so<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.079> back<00:03:29.319> of<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.530> TV<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
so on the back of the TV you have the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.589 
so on the back of the TV you have the
two<00:03:30.879> HDMI<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.689> was<00:03:32.290> actually<00:03:32.590> outputting<00:03:32.920> in

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
two HDMI I was actually outputting in

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.530 
two HDMI I was actually outputting in
HDMI<00:03:34.599> not<00:03:34.870> component<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.700> TV<00:03:37.000> was<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.329> you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
HDMI not component and the TV was on you

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.660 
HDMI not component and the TV was on you
have<00:03:37.659> component<00:03:38.170> here<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.349> the<00:03:38.439> bottom<00:03:38.739> your

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
have component here on the bottom your

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.729 
have component here on the bottom your
VGA<00:03:41.099> they<00:03:42.099> call<00:03:42.280> RGB<00:03:42.790> PC<00:03:43.230> audio<00:03:44.230> for<00:03:44.560> your

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
VGA they call RGB PC audio for your

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.020 
VGA they call RGB PC audio for your
computer<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.400> your<00:03:46.090> TV<00:03:46.389> tuner<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.129> side

computer and your TV tuner on the side

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.830 
computer and your TV tuner on the side
of<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.440> TV<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.859> have<00:03:51.220> your<00:03:51.370> output<00:03:52.180> for<00:03:52.449> sound

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
of the TV you have your output for sound

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720 
of the TV you have your output for sound
so<00:03:53.319> it<00:03:53.470> has<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.590> 3.5<00:03:54.220> millimeter<00:03:54.430> headphone

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
so it has a 3.5 millimeter headphone

I'm sorry response time and input lag

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.230 
I'm sorry response time and input lag
input<00:05:55.930> lag<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.289> basically<00:05:56.849> if<00:05:57.849> you're<00:05:58.030> playing

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
input lag is basically if you're playing

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.930 
input lag is basically if you're playing
like<00:05:58.450> Guitar<00:05:58.990> Hero<00:05:59.289> and<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.740> are<00:05:59.950> hitting<00:06:00.700> the

like Guitar Hero and you are hitting the

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.790 
like Guitar Hero and you are hitting the
buttons<00:06:01.300> and<00:06:01.570> it<00:06:01.750> seems<00:06:02.470> like<00:06:02.620> it's

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
buttons and it seems like it's

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.550 
buttons and it seems like it's
responding<00:06:03.340> slowly<00:06:03.760> on<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.150> computer<00:06:04.570> or<00:06:05.380> I'm

that's input lag response time is

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.159 
that's input lag response time is
basically<00:06:10.680> when<00:06:11.680> one<00:06:12.250> pixel<00:06:12.970> changes<00:06:13.479> color

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169

chance to test the input lag on this you

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.020 
chance to test the input lag on this you
might<00:06:24.099> be<00:06:24.130> able<00:06:24.280> to<00:06:24.430> find<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:24.729> on<00:06:24.849> digital

might be able to find it on digital

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.060 
might be able to find it on digital
versus<00:06:25.599> if<00:06:25.810> they<00:06:25.960> have<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.260> up
