they're having 16 errors and so just go

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
they're having 16 errors and so just go
into<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.109> GD<00:00:31.590> g<00:00:32.009> data<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> source<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
into your GD g data go to source and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
into your GD g data go to source and
then<00:00:33.750> um<00:00:35.329> import<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.540> g<00:00:36.719> data<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.290> mean<00:00:37.950> open

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
then um import the g data I mean open

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
then um import the g data I mean open
the<00:00:38.370> g<00:00:38.550> data<00:00:39.020> Xcode<00:00:40.020> project<00:00:41.540> I'm<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.750> my

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the g data Xcode project I'm on my

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.000 
the g data Xcode project I'm on my
slower<00:00:43.200> computer<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> might<00:00:44.040> take<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.219> while

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
slower computer so it might take a while

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.990 
slower computer so it might take a while
so<00:00:47.010> once<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.760> um<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:49.739> common<00:00:50.610> which

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so once you have that um in common which

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.340 
so once you have that um in common which
are<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:52.340> imported<00:00:53.690> you'll<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> an

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
are we imported you'll see that an

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.130 
are we imported you'll see that an
optional<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.340> will<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.670> O<00:00:56.930> it'll<00:00:57.930> look

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
optional there will be an O it'll look

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:14.410 
optional there will be an O it'll look
kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.590> this

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:42.020 

it'll<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> it'll<00:01:41.790> look<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it'll look like this so it'll look like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.520 
it'll look like this so it'll look like
that<00:01:42.210> maybe<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that maybe that I think the a is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
that maybe that I think the a is
capitalized<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.640> should<00:01:47.820> look<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.060> that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
capitalized but it should look like that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.910 
capitalized but it should look like that
you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.200> delete<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.450> um<00:01:51.920> then

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you can just delete that and um then

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
you can just delete that and um then
you'll<00:01:53.429> your<00:01:53.880> project<00:01:54.450> should<00:01:54.690> run<00:01:54.960> fine<00:01:55.320> I'm

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you'll your project should run fine I'm

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
you'll your project should run fine I'm
going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.550> another<00:01:56.759> tutorial<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.479> for
