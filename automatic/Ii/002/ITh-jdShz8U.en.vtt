00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
talking about the construction what goes

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.990 
talking about the construction what goes
behind<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.740> suit<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.400> guys<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
bridge differentiate and know when you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.080 
bridge differentiate and know when you
know<00:00:10.800> all<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.099> stones<00:00:11.400> are<00:00:11.550> always<00:00:11.820> flying

time do a you know two three part series

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.790 
time do a you know two three part series
on<00:00:18.300> suits<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.109> today<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.470> I'm<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> be

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
on suits so today what I'm going to be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.320 
on suits so today what I'm going to be
talking<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.369> actually<00:00:20.550> canvassing

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
talking about is actually canvassing

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.700 
talking about is actually canvassing
there's<00:00:21.570> four<00:00:22.020> different<00:00:22.050> ways<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.619> can

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
there's four different ways you can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.830 
there's four different ways you can
construct<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> suit<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:24.000> either<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.480> full

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
construct a suit it can either be full

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.220 
construct a suit it can either be full
canvas<00:00:25.289> half<00:00:25.949> canvas<00:00:26.550> fuse<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.570> unstructured

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
canvas half canvas fuse or unstructured

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
canvas half canvas fuse or unstructured
and<00:00:28.590> obviously<00:00:28.980> fuse<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> worst<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.179> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and obviously fuse is the worst one so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.240 
and obviously fuse is the worst one so
what<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:31.109> these<00:00:31.289> words<00:00:31.590> mean<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.099> all

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
what all these words mean this is all

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.920 
what all these words mean this is all
basically<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> construction<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> suit

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
basically the construction of the suit

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
basically the construction of the suit
so<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:35.250> now<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> half

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so what you see right now this is a half

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
so what you see right now this is a half
canvas<00:00:36.630> suit<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.559> structures<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
canvas suit this is what structures of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
canvas suit this is what structures of
soup<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.700> gives<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> suit<00:00:39.210> its<00:00:39.450> shape

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
soup this what gives the suit its shape

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
soup this what gives the suit its shape
and<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> take<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.800> suit<00:00:41.010> off<00:00:41.160> you

and if you take this suit off you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
and if you take this suit off you
usually<00:00:41.790> feel<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.719> know<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> front<00:00:43.260> panel

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
usually feel you know the front panel

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
usually feel you know the front panel
it's<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.250> bit<00:00:44.370> thicker<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.360> has

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it's a little bit thicker and it has

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
it's a little bit thicker and it has
shoulder<00:00:45.870> pads<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.260> course<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.860> half

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
shoulder pads of course like all half

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
shoulder pads of course like all half

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
all this is really the structure of the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.610

suit and between the fabric and the
lining<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.979> where<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> canvasing<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
lining that's where the canvasing is and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
lining that's where the canvasing is and
that's<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.450> structures<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.110> soup<00:01:19.350> now

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.770 
all in the front that's what a full
canvas<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> best<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> only

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
canvas is and it's the best the only

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
canvas is and it's the best the only
downside<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.229> full<00:01:25.530> canvas<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.580> price<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
downside to full canvas is the price it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
downside to full canvas is the price it
takes<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.560> produce<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
takes a lot more time to produce it's a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
takes a lot more time to produce it's a
lot<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.670> expensive<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.180> produce<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
lot more expensive to produce and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
lot more expensive to produce and
consequently<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.280> expensive

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
consequently it's a lot more expensive

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.240 
consequently it's a lot more expensive
to<00:01:33.240> buy<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> next<00:01:34.590> best<00:01:34.860> will

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to buy right so the next best will

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
to buy right so the next best will
always<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.759> half<00:01:36.030> canvas<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
always be half canvas it's like the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.210 
always be half canvas it's like the
middle<00:01:37.049> ground<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.560> still<00:01:37.770> getting<00:01:37.890> all

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
middle ground you're still getting all

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
middle ground you're still getting all
that<00:01:38.340> great<00:01:38.640> stuff<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:38.970> full<00:01:39.240> canvas<00:01:39.659> but

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that great stuff from full canvas but

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.109 
that great stuff from full canvas but
you're<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.829> basically<00:01:41.220> canvasing<00:01:41.790> less

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you're you're basically canvasing less

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
you're you're basically canvasing less
of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> suit<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.750> whereas<00:01:42.990> full<00:01:43.259> canvas<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
of the suit so whereas full canvas is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.469 
of the suit so whereas full canvas is
the<00:01:43.979> whole<00:01:44.220> front<00:01:44.549> half<00:01:44.700> canvas<00:01:45.299> only

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the whole front half canvas only

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
the whole front half canvas only
canvases<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> lapel<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.280> chest<00:01:47.549> piece

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
canvases the lapel and the chest piece

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.249 
canvases the lapel and the chest piece
that's<00:01:48.299> all<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.869> seen<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.140> you'll

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that's all they can be seen that you'll

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
that's all they can be seen that you'll
have<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.649> half<00:01:49.799> canvassing<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.759> still

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
have in half canvassing and you still

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
have in half canvassing and you still
get<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.659> shape<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> see<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.439> now

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
get that good shape as you see right now

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
get that good shape as you see right now
still<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> good<00:01:53.759> drape<00:01:54.090> obviously<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.659> as

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
still get a good drape obviously not as

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.719 
still get a good drape obviously not as
best<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> won't<00:01:55.740> probably<00:01:55.950> last<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.549> long

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
best and it won't probably last as long

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.569 
best and it won't probably last as long
but<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.719> lot<00:01:58.020> cheaper<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.430> lot

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
but it's also a lot cheaper it's a lot

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.219 
but it's also a lot cheaper it's a lot
faster<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.969> produce<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.600> obviously<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.990> lot

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
faster to produce and obviously a lot

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
faster to produce and obviously a lot
cheaper<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.680> buy<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.340> still<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.729> all<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
cheaper to buy so you still get all the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.969 
cheaper to buy so you still get all the
pros<00:02:03.329> There<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.020> obviously<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.560> couple

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
pros There is obviously a couple

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.410 
pros There is obviously a couple
drawbacks<00:02:05.460> it'll<00:02:05.700> never<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.149> good<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
drawbacks it'll never be as good as a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300 
drawbacks it'll never be as good as a
full<00:02:06.659> canvas<00:02:06.990> suit<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.680> still<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.009> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
full canvas suit but you still get you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
your mind all on structure it is it's

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.879 
your mind all on structure it is it's
basically<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.170> word<00:02:23.349> says<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.769> know

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
basically what the word says you know

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.399 
basically what the word says you know
it's<00:02:24.189> a<00:02:24.340> soup<00:02:24.579> that's<00:02:24.609> not<00:02:25.090> structured<00:02:26.019> with

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
it's a soup that's not structured with

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.500 
it's a soup that's not structured with
canvas<00:02:26.829> or<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.129> fuse<00:02:27.639> garment<00:02:27.999> so<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.389> basically

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
canvas or a fuse garment so it basically

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.809 
canvas or a fuse garment so it basically
has<00:02:28.989> nothing<00:02:29.650> no<00:02:29.829> structuring<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.519> lapel

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.750 
canvassing whatsoever it's actually also
very<00:02:35.349> hard<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.829> produce<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.370> not<00:02:36.609> going

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
very hard to produce so it's not going

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.550 
very hard to produce so it's not going
to<00:02:36.819> be<00:02:36.909> cheaper<00:02:37.299> it's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.840> very<00:02:38.049> hard<00:02:38.290> process

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
to be cheaper it's a very hard process

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.069 
to be cheaper it's a very hard process
and<00:02:38.920> all<00:02:39.189> it<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.700> literally<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.540> piece<00:02:40.930> of

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
niger cotton unstructured and it's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.959 
niger cotton unstructured and it's
basically<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.699> only

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
basically that you know so the only

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.429 
basically that you know so the only
downside<00:02:58.389> to<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:58.659> that<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.049> does<00:02:59.260> not

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
downside to this is that it does not

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.080 
downside to this is that it does not
shape<00:02:59.799> you<00:02:59.949> know<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.219> still<00:03:00.430> very<00:03:00.699> hard<00:03:00.939> to

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
shape you know it's still very hard to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.849 
shape you know it's still very hard to
produce<00:03:01.269> it's<00:03:01.810> actually<00:03:02.109> as<00:03:02.260> hard<00:03:02.560> probably

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
produce it's actually as hard probably

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.759 
produce it's actually as hard probably
it's<00:03:03.760> still<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.510> not<00:03:04.689> any<00:03:04.900> cheaper<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
it's still it's not any cheaper and it

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's still it's not any cheaper and it
doesn't<00:03:06.069> shape<00:03:06.219> your<00:03:06.370> body<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.760> that's<00:03:06.849> what

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
doesn't shape your body and that's what

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.830 
doesn't shape your body and that's what
some<00:03:07.299> people<00:03:07.329> don't<00:03:07.629> like<00:03:07.780> about

very<00:03:32.889> cool<00:03:33.189> it's<00:03:33.639> basically<00:03:34.060> like<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.299> said

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
very cool it's basically like I said

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.479 
very cool it's basically like I said
just<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.930> piece<00:03:35.079> of<00:03:35.139> fabric<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.650> again<00:03:36.310> that's

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
just a piece of fabric so again that's

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.969 
just a piece of fabric so again that's
the<00:03:36.699> only<00:03:36.970> downside<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.599> does<00:03:37.959> not<00:03:38.259> structure

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
the only downside it does not structure

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.039 
the only downside it does not structure
your<00:03:39.159> body<00:03:39.340> finally<00:03:39.970> it's<00:03:40.209> fused<00:03:40.629> what<00:03:41.019> a
