done<00:03:19.090> by<00:03:19.300> doing<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.750> cardiogram<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.860> get<00:03:21.069> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
done by doing a cardiogram to get the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.400 
done by doing a cardiogram to get the
size<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.060> hole<00:03:22.239> where<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.720> restrictive

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
restrictive how big it is and then we

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.650 
restrictive how big it is and then we
see<00:03:28.540> whether<00:03:28.750> we<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:28.959> manage<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.100> help<00:03:30.280> him

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
