00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:19.050
 2 I would walk the third and penultimate 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.759
 episode of residents flies revelations 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.770
 two could have had an evaluation 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.230
 higher than a whole vote compared to 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.000
 previous but kakÃ  has done everything to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 appease enthusiasm and fall into 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.090
 some trivial game design naivety 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 really unforgivable 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 we speak in particular of the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.580
 bad management of enemy waves 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.339
 that they make to repeat speciously 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.080
 some sections several times a bit 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.940
 backtracking is a set of actions from 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.070
 perform forcibly that appear like 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.479
 useless of penalties on the road that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 could have been imperfect 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.280
 straight is this mind you well happen 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.620
 the episode that so far convinced us the most 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.479
 of all the condemnation is the episode that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.369
 have higher event density than 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.140
 enemies of weight and also what lasts 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.000
 more especially due to certain 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.799
 gimmicks that oblige to undertake 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.710
 cumbersome actions studied specifically 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.270
 to dilute the total time elapsed e 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 also the episode with a design of the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.469
 a couple more inspired and unhealthy levels 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 of environments really worthy of note and 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.700
 no bad puzzles they were 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.500
 culpably missed before yes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 could even talk about the fact that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.130
 finally represents the rescue of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.929
 claire and moira protagonists of one 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.490
 certainly more campaign section 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.530
 engaging than barry's 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.539
 natalia that until now they had completely 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.759
 our attention focused on 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.469
 all levels are instead recorded one 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 sharp braking with regard to the 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.759
 plot that progresses with great discretion and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.679
 ideally prepares for what 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.140
 we hope it is a great ending that has the 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.880
 need to be self-contained for 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.249
 do not leave anyone or anyone in suspense 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
 open up to eventual elsie in the 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.640
 sentencing the two girls throw themselves to the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.979
 search for a character you don't 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 we reveal the identity by first putting on 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.399
 in an abandoned factory where 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.469
 they trap traps and bizarre systems 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.010
 security to then pass through a 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.750
 slaughterhouse of horrors 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.790
 the settings are the best ones 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.130
 we have seen so far with applause 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.990
 particular to the last of the two capable 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 to transmit even a slight anxiety 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.619
 that we never expected 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.840
 nothing incredibly scary either 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.060
 clear but its realization shows 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.980
 unequivocally that cacco but every 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.260
 he knows how to remember his past 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.760
 while failing to respond to choices 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.040
 marketing that we avoid commenting on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.870
 here through these areas 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.550
 we will have to go back often on our own 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.590
 steps to insert objects into 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.330
 right points giving way to some 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.070
 backtracking that never gets too much 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.840
 inconvenient annoying once 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.490
 arrived in the following areas but did not 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.170
 can do without being annoyed by 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.820
 some waves of falling enemies 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.470
 from the raised platforms the 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.330
 controlled character who must 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.160
 retrace a portion of the map 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.660
 while holding the monsters at bay 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 situation tends to recover 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.350
 again on the occasion of the final boss 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.340
 and during the last session, yes 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.230
 commits to giving the best of itself 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.240
 technically while putting under strain 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.370
 graphic engine that loses a bit of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.290
 ugly fluidity to the image instead 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.090
 some solutions adopted before 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.150
 closing of the leverage chapter 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.500
 almost exclusively on the three lander like 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.030
 previously told the campaign of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.250
 drinking natalia suffers a slight 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.660
 unexpected drop especially a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 because of certain expedients that do not 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.130
 perhaps we liked the episode at all 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.110
 previous he had accustomed us too well 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.550
 or maybe it is simply a 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.320
 moment of history in which there is the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.580
 need to get some fresh water before 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.200
 fully understand what the role of 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.790
 natalia within a plot that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.580
 clearly wants to hold on to the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.200
 the most important revelation also 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.090
 settings shown here do not have us 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.220
 especially made that crazy 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.019
 mine that knew so much about reskin and that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.000
 it seemed a bit flatter than usual 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.830
 in the final part of their campaign 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.200
 you have to take a cage with you 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.910
 metal that acts as a counterweight 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.800
 laying it on conveyor belts 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.600
 arranged on multiple levels of height in the 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.280
 mine the barry outdoors in essence 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.290
 move awkwardly to activate the 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.570
 switches that pave the way to give 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.620
 divided into compartments first 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.390
 to arrive at the final battle 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.460
 predictable but not for this but 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.930
 realized 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.730
 even the size finally has a role 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.770
 more active especially in the part 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.390
 central of the campaign which provides for a 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.000
 continuous ping pong between the two characters 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.950
 the helpless child is in charge of 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.930
 lift up bulkheads and indicate 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.300
 promptly the exact location of the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.010
 invisible cats barry forced to 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.840
 cross the lower floor lives 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.400
 instead get rid of all the enemies and 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.320
 pay attention to the foreseen ones in which 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.150
 will meet Natalia until arriving at 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.310
 moment the reunion is pass 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.960
 the next setting is 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 of a precise choice that changes pace 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.280
 of game making it less rapid and more 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.020
 however, there are plenty of moments 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.850
 in which we must protect natalia 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.410
 take his control to warn 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.030
 bear and the invisible threat e 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.010
 return to the place of man for 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.730
 get rid of the enemies they spit on 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.840
 and under 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.000
 this always happens with big 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.220
 naturalness alternating typical sections 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.540
 from third person shooter to others 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.580
 that require more advancement 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.460
 weighted is definitely less rash 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.830
 in the usual excellent as usual le 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.750
 exciting raid mode arenas 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.670
 various and with some welcome variation 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.410
 on the subject who is the search for time 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.120
 perfect and wants to focus on unlocking 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.980
 of the numerous bonuses it will have 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.690
 certainly what to rejoice since 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.490
 this mode has a lot to offer in 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.490
 terms of longevity and replayability
