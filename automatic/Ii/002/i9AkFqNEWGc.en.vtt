00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
what we're going we're pivoting so I

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.420 
what we're going we're pivoting so I
can't<00:01:26.990> get<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.350> wheel<00:01:27.590> spin<00:01:27.890> if<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.100> get<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.280> wheel

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
can't get a wheel spin if I get a wheel

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.220 
can't get a wheel spin if I get a wheel
spin<00:01:28.700> it's<00:01:28.850> not<00:01:28.970> gonna<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.300> again<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.050> it's

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
spin it's not gonna do it again so it's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.810 
spin it's not gonna do it again so it's
so<00:01:30.409> important<00:01:30.980> to<00:01:31.100> make<00:01:31.250> sure<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.520> get<00:01:31.610> weight

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
so important to make sure you get weight

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.760 
so important to make sure you get weight
on<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.000> rear<00:01:32.240> tire<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.560> tired

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
on that rear tire and get that and tired

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.010 
on that rear tire and get that and tired
of<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.130> tire<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.880> grab<00:01:35.120> in<00:01:35.480> that<00:01:35.690> bike<00:01:35.870> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
of that tire to grab in that bike the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.720 
of that tire to grab in that bike the
lugs<00:01:36.230> so<00:01:36.409> it's<00:01:36.590> kind<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.830> like<00:01:36.980> a<00:01:37.010> birth<00:01:37.310> you

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
lugs so it's kind of like a birth you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.270 
lugs so it's kind of like a birth you
know<00:01:37.850> versus<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.420> RPMs<00:01:39.200> up<00:01:39.500> where<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.070> lot<00:01:40.190> of

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
know versus that RPMs up where a lot of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.710 
know versus that RPMs up where a lot of
guys<00:01:40.400> do<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.000> if<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.360> don't<00:01:41.540> have<00:01:41.690> a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
guys do and and if you don't have a

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440 
guys do and and if you don't have a
recluse<00:01:42.590> or<00:01:42.920> something<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.400> where<00:01:44.360> you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
recluse or something like that where you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.060 
recluse or something like that where you
can<00:01:44.570> get<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.840> bike<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.200> lug<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.830> know<00:01:45.950> it's

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
can get that bike the lug you know it's

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.290 
can get that bike the lug you know it's
a<00:01:46.100> lot<00:01:46.250> harder<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.580> that's<00:01:46.729> one<00:01:47.000> of<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.150> big

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
a lot harder and that's one of the big

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.390 
a lot harder and that's one of the big
features<00:01:47.690> as<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.320> saw<00:01:48.560> like<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.920> front<00:01:49.159> ends

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
features as you saw like the front ends

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.310 
features as you saw like the front ends
up<00:01:49.520> I'm<00:01:49.729> basically<00:01:50.060> almost<00:01:50.330> have<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:51.110> bike

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
up I'm basically almost have the bike

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.260 
up I'm basically almost have the bike
and<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.560> full<00:01:51.800> kind<00:01:52.040> of<00:01:52.159> really<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:52.940> when<00:01:53.060> I<00:01:53.090> get

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
and a full kind of really but when I get

that's another section this long rock

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.150 
that's another section this long rock
section<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.780> go<00:02:19.900> through<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> Red<00:02:20.470> Rocks<00:02:20.739> you

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
section I go through the Red Rocks you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.949 
section I go through the Red Rocks you
know<00:02:21.250> there<00:02:21.430> are<00:02:21.520> big<00:02:21.700> holes<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:22.390> lot<00:02:22.780> more

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
know there are big holes a lot more

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.229 
know there are big holes a lot more
deceiving<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.400> big<00:02:24.550> thing<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.850> carrying<00:02:25.150> on

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
deceiving the big thing is carrying on

the minim sometimes I'll go and they're

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.470 
the minim sometimes I'll go and they're
kind<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.400> Supercross<00:02:27.910> whoops<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.330> see

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
kind of like Supercross whoops you see

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.150 
kind of like Supercross whoops you see
those<00:02:28.660> guys<00:02:28.810> up<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.140> ship<00:02:29.290> getting<00:02:29.890> ready<00:02:30.069> to

those guys up the ship getting ready to
enter<00:02:30.280> whoops<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.120> same<00:02:31.330> thing<00:02:31.569> in<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
enter whoops it's the same thing in the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.300 
enter whoops it's the same thing in the
rocks<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.410> want<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> carry<00:02:32.830> momentum

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
rocks like you want to carry momentum

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.380 
rocks like you want to carry momentum
through<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.819> slower<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.239> go<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
through that the slower you go the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.449 
through that the slower you go the
harder<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.840> gonna<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.680> I'll<00:02:35.860> jump<00:02:36.100> into

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
harder it's gonna be so I'll jump into

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.000 
harder it's gonna be so I'll jump into
second<00:02:36.850> or<00:02:36.970> third<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:38.319> know<00:02:38.440> maybe<00:02:38.890> just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
second or third and you know maybe just

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070 
second or third and you know maybe just
kind<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.910> weight<00:02:40.060> back<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.540> let<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
kind of get the weight back and let the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.390 
kind of get the weight back and let the
clutch<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.470> its<00:02:41.620> work<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.130> just

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
clutch do its work you know just

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.550 
clutch do its work you know just
plugging<00:02:43.180> through<00:02:43.510> there<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.170> keeping<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
plugging through there and keeping that

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.080 
plugging through there and keeping that
front<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:44.980> high<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.880> that's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
front and high and you know that's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.120 
front and high and you know that's
that's<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.600> key<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:49.560> matrix<00:02:50.560> section

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
that's the key for that a matrix section

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.070 
that's the key for that a matrix section
is<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> lot<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.760> rocks<00:02:52.269> in<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.540> matrix<00:02:52.959> and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
is a lot of rocks in the matrix and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.660 
is a lot of rocks in the matrix and
probably<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.860> toughest<00:02:54.190> thing<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.459> enduro

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
probably the toughest thing and enduro

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.490 
probably the toughest thing and enduro
crossing<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.810> section<00:02:56.110> we<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:56.350> out

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
crossing and the section we have out

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.920 
crossing and the section we have out
here<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:57.519> matrix<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:58.000> pretty<00:02:58.150> big<00:02:58.299> logs<00:02:58.540> so

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
here the matrix of pretty big logs so

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.320 
here the matrix of pretty big logs so
you<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.370> bike<00:03:00.549> responsive

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
you have to have that bike responsive

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.180 
you have to have that bike responsive
and<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:02.290> know<00:03:02.410> one<00:03:02.560> thing<00:03:02.680> with<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> clutch

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and you know one thing with the clutch

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.729 
and you know one thing with the clutch
is<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:03.940> responsive<00:03:04.600> but<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.079> can<00:03:05.320> let<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.530> out

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
is it is responsive but I can let it out

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.920 
is it is responsive but I can let it out
and<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.190> has<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.640> snap<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.269> know<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.450> want<00:03:07.750> that

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
and it has a snap you know I want that

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.110 
and it has a snap you know I want that
brat<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.320> want<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.620> aggression<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:10.090> a

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
brat I want that aggression and with a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.490 
brat I want that aggression and with a
matrix<00:03:10.329> section<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.930> first<00:03:11.049> one<00:03:11.320> I'm

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
matrix section the first one I'm

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500 
matrix section the first one I'm
doubling<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.370> need<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.790> bike<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.120> respond

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
doubling so I need the bike to respond

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.090 
doubling so I need the bike to respond
really<00:03:13.870> well<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.440> that's<00:03:14.860> where<00:03:15.010> I'm

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
really well and and that's where I'm

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.099 
really well and and that's where I'm
getting<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.489> responses<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.359> don't<00:03:16.780> hit

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
getting that responses like don't hit

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.440 
getting that responses like don't hit
that<00:03:17.320> downside<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.670> then<00:03:18.880> wheel<00:03:19.060> tap<00:03:19.269> will

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
that downside and then wheel tap will

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.300 
that downside and then wheel tap will
tap<00:03:19.690> try<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.959> go<00:03:20.109> through<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.190> know

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
tap try to go through and you know

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.610 
tap try to go through and you know
that's<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.940> nice<00:03:22.480> aspect<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.200> clutch<00:03:23.410> is
