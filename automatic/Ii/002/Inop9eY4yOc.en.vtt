00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.240 
are really ready to start the playoffs a
much<00:00:33.300> different<00:00:33.719> feeling<00:00:34.020> isn't<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> starting

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
much different feeling isn't it starting

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310

a<00:00:35.340> playoff<00:00:35.640> series<00:00:35.969> against<00:00:36.420> San<00:00:36.690> Jose<00:00:37.050> then

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
a playoff series against San Jose then

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
a playoff series against San Jose then
maybe<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.280> last<00:00:38.460> couple<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> years<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
maybe the last couple of years when you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.799 
maybe the last couple of years when you
had<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.200> opening<00:00:40.590> round<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.309> home<00:00:41.489> ice

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
had the opening round here on home ice

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.799 
had the opening round here on home ice
well<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> difference<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:44.480> last<00:00:45.480> two

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
well the difference you know last two

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
well the difference you know last two
years<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.260> started<00:00:46.649> off<00:00:46.800> after<00:00:47.340> having<00:00:47.610> won

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
years we started off after having won

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.930 
years we started off after having won
the<00:00:47.850> president's<00:00:48.329> trophies<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.980> year<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the president's trophies this year that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
the president's trophies this year that
wasn't<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> case<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.340> little

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
wasn't the case I think we're a little

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
wasn't the case I think we're a little
bit<00:00:54.149> under<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> radar<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:55.739> may<00:00:56.010> not

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
bit under the radar which may not

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.340 
bit under the radar which may not
necessarily<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> bad<00:00:57.180> thing<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.870> terms<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
necessarily be a bad thing in terms of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.369 
necessarily be a bad thing in terms of
the<00:00:58.579> perception<00:00:59.579> league-wide<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the perception league-wide but the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
the perception league-wide but the
biggest<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:01.980> I've<00:01:02.160> noticed<00:01:02.609> compared

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
biggest thing that I've noticed compared

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.990 
biggest thing that I've noticed compared
to<00:01:03.570> last<00:01:03.719> season<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.250> after<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> short

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to last season is that after the short

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
to last season is that after the short
off<00:01:06.299> season<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> had<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:07.920> loss<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
off season we had because of our loss in

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120 
off season we had because of our loss in
Game<00:01:08.610> seven<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> cup<00:01:09.360> final<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> whole

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
Game seven of the cup final the whole

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
Game seven of the cup final the whole
year<00:01:11.520> had<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> different<00:01:12.240> tone<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.630> tenor<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
year had a different tone and tenor to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
year had a different tone and tenor to
it<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:14.159> first<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.670> games<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it and our first two games of the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.960 
it and our first two games of the
playoffs<00:01:15.299> last<00:01:15.750> year<00:01:16.049> against<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> LA<00:01:16.619> Kings

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
playoffs last year against the LA Kings

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
playoffs last year against the LA Kings
really<00:01:17.970> felt<00:01:18.210> more<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.600> games<00:01:18.930> 83<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.710> 84<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
really felt more like games 83 and 84 of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.920 
really felt more like games 83 and 84 of
the<00:01:20.340> regular<00:01:20.700> season<00:01:20.729> than<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.330> did<00:01:21.390> games

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the regular season than they did games

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
the regular season than they did games
one<00:01:22.170> into<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> playoffs<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
one into the playoffs and that's not the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.660 
one into the playoffs and that's not the
case<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.330> time<00:01:24.390> around<00:01:24.979> how<00:01:25.979> important<00:01:26.460> in

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
case this time around how important in

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
case this time around how important in
Europe<00:01:27.390> inion<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> experience<00:01:28.439> factor

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
Europe inion is the experience factor

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
Europe inion is the experience factor
against<00:01:29.640> San<00:01:29.970> Jose<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.720> you've<00:01:30.869> got<00:01:30.990> two

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
against San Jose because you've got two

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
against San Jose because you've got two
teams<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.700> talked<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:33.030> had<00:01:33.329> long

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
teams that as you talked about had long

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
teams that as you talked about had long
playoff<00:01:33.960> runs<00:01:34.409> two<00:01:34.740> years<00:01:34.979> ago<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.460> both

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
playoff runs two years ago but both

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
playoff runs two years ago but both
teams<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> same<00:01:36.479> spot<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
teams are in the same spot and that it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
teams are in the same spot and that it
probably<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> bitter<00:01:38.579> taste<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.060> their

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
probably got a bitter taste in their

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
probably got a bitter taste in their
mouth<00:01:39.360> after<00:01:39.720> losing<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.259> five<00:01:40.530> games<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
mouth after losing in five games and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.940 
mouth after losing in five games and
round<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.790> last<00:01:42.090> year<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:43.290> experience<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
round one last year well experience is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
round one last year well experience is
that<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.960> what
