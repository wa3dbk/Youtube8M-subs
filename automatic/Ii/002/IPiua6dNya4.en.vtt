00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.950
 action camera most cases are needed 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.139
 people with particular hobbies 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.119
 like snowboarders surfers cyclists 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.190
 skaters and other blabbering society by 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.200
 view grandmothers your porch exactly 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.240
 these people with their hobbies created a demand for 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.520
 cameras are able to shoot and hobbies 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.130
 completely in different conditions kuwait 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.990
 water drop courage dementia after all 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.730
 often certain debt maneuvers 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.620
 work out and when everything worked out 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.240
 how nice when everything is not only 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.890
 in the memory of the audience but also on youtube 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.900
 example but today similar cameras 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 which, by the way, have already been used a lot 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.800
 not only in active sports example 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.750
 motorcyclists cling to their helmet for 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.940
 fixing everything on the road 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.860
 motorists on the bad in their cars for 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.510
 cool video and in German 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.989
 we began to apply their films 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.430
 use 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.290
 action camera for video reviews 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.450
 cars for this they have everything 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.390
 the most necessary waterproof 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.530
 case that will also save in the fall 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.790
 wide lens and a bunch 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.380
 all kinds of mounts 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.360
 until recently we used 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.530
 gopro hero 3 black edition 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.530
 but suddenly everything changed 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.190
 This is sony action cam hd are a 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.290
 with 33 and you need her name on the go 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.440
 steamed the least of course main 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.040
 the question that you just outside the hurt and 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.470
 Mikhail Mikhail 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.530
 why did you give up I will goupro 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.450
 i will say i am not mikhail i am alexander and from lips 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.369
 Roma did not refuse anyway 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 blog about how the iphone may not be the most 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.000
 functional and practical action camera 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.920
 but most accessories are sharpened 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.539
 for her, for example, we recently 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.850
 got such an accessory as 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.350
 professional drone and he's on board 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.120
 can only carry goupro 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.220
 however for most tasks including 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 wheelbarrow reviews and active sports 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.850
 sony still cooler and all 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.160
 parameters immediately autonomy 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.900
 form factor stabilization work speed 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.850
 and of course the cost itself 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040
 the main points I'll take a walk and begin 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.720
 form factor you generally saw was right 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.239
 not well of course we are all used to it 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.500
 form factor but when did you first 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.390
 lay out in a tidy sum for this 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.040
 camera and then pick up this 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 incomprehensible rectangle involuntarily 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.570
 one wonders not thrown only 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.459
 This plan is more ergonomic and made in 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.769
 camcorder oddly for 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.720
 start shooting and and do not even need to include 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.130
 separate buttons simply 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.440
 click on the record and after a few 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.000
 seconds everything will start to fix it to 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.190
 the word is very useful for ordinary 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 life situations example in communicating with 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.360
 inspector not to miss anything 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.470
 next to the ear of the record there is a blocker 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.510
 which can be enabled when 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.489
 transporting the camera so that in the bag 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.110
 do not accidentally click on an entry from others 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.880
 the controls on the camera are 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.739
 only two menu navigation buttons 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.660
 which is a word fast and so on 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.700
 There are two microphone styles for this camera. 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.980
 stupid not brag and they 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.840
 functional even in a protective case in 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.880
 he has a microphone hole in gopro 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.190
 The sound in the case in general can be considered not 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.799
 it is also written there is a micro usb and micro them 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.450
 Dima and attention microphone input to 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.970
 this camera can connect a loop 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.709
 I have never seen anything like this 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.900
 vacation you can rent a full 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.459
 home movie with good sound and stereo 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.530
 microphone and let you record sound 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.840
 happening around to make of 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.560
 there is a lining on the moving cover 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.269
 battery 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.370
 it changes easily and the card slot 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.690
 micro sd memory autonomy to the word 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.700
 enough for about three s 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.130
 half four hours of video recording in 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.320
 full hd with wifi enabled and this 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.250
 To go cool except Wi-Fi bag there 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.170
 gps cat 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.970
 I immediately disconnected however if you 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.750
 planning to use 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.010
 specialized software can 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.900
 watch your whole route 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.330
 useful for lovers of long pokatushek 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.550
 There are no large displays on the screen 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.560
 if you need to have to buy separately 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.690
 Bracelet is available on the screen with a hand 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.610
 also a case that turns an action camera into 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.410
 normal with flip-up display 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.359
 but this should not be necessary because 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.489
 there is a more elegant solution to withdraw 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.560
 The image on the smartphone display is such 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.780
 possibility is in gopro but everyone knows 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.820
 what wild delays await you right there 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.680
 actually live on screen 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.540
 it's useful to see where the camera is 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 looking on your helmet or on the back 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.080
 car to display pictures on 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.360
 smartphone will need the play application 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.830
 memories mobile it is free and in it 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.750
 need and go camera and enter password 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.700
 which is stored in a text file on 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.050
 the camera itself after this straight and in 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.430
 application can be done 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.530
 almost any action 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.450
 change modes and start and stop 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.160
 you can take pictures and more 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.900
 quickly save footage straight 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.940
 on smartphone for quick connection with 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.650
 android smartphone mid camera have nfc 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.960
 now about the case which incidentally is in 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.310
 it is easy to use 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.320
 maintains immersion to five meters and 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.760
 in it of course you can shoot a video but 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.740
 the main thing he has is standard 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.729
 mount for tripods this is not so 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.500
 lack of goupro 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.660
 only a couple of accessories included 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.320
 Velcro on the helmet is now about the main photo 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.850
 and video 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.729
 the video is recorded in the following 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.400
 permissions by such parameters 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.650
 1920 to 1080 60 frames per second and 50 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.680
 frames per second full hd 30 frames per 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.620
 second and 25 frames per second 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.570
 1280 by 720 120 frames per second 30 frames 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.400
 per second and 25 frames per second also 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.500
 there is a time lapse mode that is even 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.810
 get you can record with a frequency of 60 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.000
 frames per second and number many mode 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.000
 120 at 720p resolution 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.850
 photos are made at 11 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.890
 megapixel resolution is cool too 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.360
 the main difference from go about availability 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.150
 image stabilization steadyshot 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.540
 the truth is she is software and for her work 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.919
 viewing angle decreases to 120 degrees 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.360
 works very cool picture literally 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.630
 actually swims 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.100
 presents sony action cam hd ras 32 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.900
 fairly affordable fast 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.960
 functional image stabilization 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.370
 and other chips definitely need to take 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.370
 and we took three because we are cool 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.370
 and
