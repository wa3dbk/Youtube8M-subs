it's the 2.8 version it is an EF lens
it's<00:00:14.849> not<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.150> L<00:00:15.299> lens<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:18.029> know<00:00:18.119> it's

it's not an L lens but you know it's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.500 
it's not an L lens but you know it's
real<00:00:18.570> close<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> L<00:00:20.369> lens<00:00:20.609> category<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.359> my

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
real close to the L lens category in my

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.759 
real close to the L lens category in my
opinion<00:00:21.960> Elaine<00:00:22.230> you're<00:00:22.350> not<00:00:22.529> probably

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
opinion Elaine you're not probably

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.109 
opinion Elaine you're not probably
getting<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> weather<00:00:23.730> sealing

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
getting you some of the weather sealing

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.660 
getting you some of the weather sealing
but<00:00:24.930> image<00:00:25.199> quality<00:00:25.410> wise<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.490> up

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
but image quality wise it's right up

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.920 
but image quality wise it's right up
there<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
there I think this is one of the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.580 
there I think this is one of the
higher-end<00:00:28.710> elite<00:00:29.670> macro<00:00:30.449> lenses<00:00:30.840> out<00:00:31.109> there

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.830 

this<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.969> again<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.480> macro

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this one it's so again it's macro

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
this one it's so again it's macro
hundred<00:00:37.200> millimeters<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:37.860> no<00:00:38.010> zoom<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
hundred millimeters there's no zoom to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
hundred millimeters there's no zoom to
it<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.690> 100<00:00:40.110> millimetres

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it it's just you get 100 millimetres

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.360 
it it's just you get 100 millimetres
that's<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:42.440> magnification<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.160> is

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's what it is magnification on it is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.049 
that's what it is magnification on it is
really<00:00:45.360> good<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.700> pretty<00:00:47.700> close

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
really good you can get in pretty close

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.040 
really good you can get in pretty close
and<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.480> huge<00:00:50.360> amount<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> damage<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.870> your

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
close you can be to focus so 0.3 one or

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.050 
close you can be to focus so 0.3 one or
point<00:01:08.970> four<00:01:09.869> eight<00:01:10.280> basically<00:01:11.280> 0.3<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.909> if

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
point four eight basically 0.3 one if

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.040 
getting up close taking a picture and
having<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.980> magnified<00:02:16.430> lens<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:17.720> know<00:02:17.840> it's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
having a magnified lens you know it's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.750 
having a magnified lens you know it's
you<00:02:18.319> there's<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.920> lot<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.190> things<00:02:19.340> going<00:02:19.580> on

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
you there's a lot of things going on

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.580 
you there's a lot of things going on
with<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.450> have<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.900> have<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> tripod

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
with it you you have to have a tripod

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.390 
with it you you have to have a tripod
basically<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.690> don't<00:02:23.870> your<00:02:24.140> error<00:02:24.400> rate

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
basically if you don't your error rate

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.860 
basically if you don't your error rate
for<00:02:25.670> blurry<00:02:26.450> images<00:02:26.959> or<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> useful<00:02:28.430> image

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
for blurry images or the useful image

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.120 
for blurry images or the useful image
percentage<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.050> gonna<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.410> pretty<00:02:30.590> low<00:02:30.860> if<00:02:31.040> you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
percentage is gonna be pretty low if you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.350 
percentage is gonna be pretty low if you
don't<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> tripod<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:35.060> not<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.330> most

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
don't have a tripod so it's not the most

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.150 
don't have a tripod so it's not the most
cheap<00:02:36.319> lens<00:02:36.650> right<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.930> expensive<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.890> think

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
cheap lens right it is expensive I think

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.910 
cheap lens right it is expensive I think
it's<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:41.150> over<00:02:41.420> $400<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.350> think<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:42.769> in

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
it's it's over $400 I think it's in

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.610 
it's it's over $400 I think it's in
around<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.819> 450<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:48.260> know<00:02:48.380> if<00:02:48.470> you're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
around the 450 so you know if you're

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.140 
around the 450 so you know if you're
getting<00:02:48.709> into<00:02:48.950> macro<00:02:49.340> photography<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.940> think

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
getting into macro photography I think

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.420 
getting into macro photography I think
this<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> good<00:02:50.720> one<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.959> start<00:02:50.989> with<00:02:51.430> but

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
this is a good one to start with but

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.270 
this is a good one to start with but
just<00:02:52.760> recognize<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.360> not<00:02:53.480> gonna<00:02:53.750> be<00:02:53.900> cheap

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
just recognize it's not gonna be cheap

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.340 
just recognize it's not gonna be cheap
I<00:02:55.280> think<00:02:55.819> this<00:02:55.970> lens<00:02:56.180> lenses<00:02:56.930> hold<00:02:57.230> their

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
I think this lens lenses hold their

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.050 
I think this lens lenses hold their
value<00:02:57.709> over<00:02:57.739> time<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.549> may<00:02:58.730> be<00:02:58.790> able<00:02:58.970> to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
value over time so you may be able to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.330 
value over time so you may be able to
find<00:02:59.360> some<00:02:59.630> use<00:03:00.170> ones<00:03:00.470> out<00:03:00.680> there<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.190> they're

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
find some use ones out there and they're

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.809 
find some use ones out there and they're
in<00:03:01.489> pretty<00:03:01.730> good<00:03:01.880> shape<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:03.580> let<00:03:04.580> me<00:03:04.670> know<00:03:04.760> if

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
in pretty good shape so let me know if

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:16.440 
in pretty good shape so let me know if
you<00:03:04.880> have<00:03:05.000> any<00:03:05.120> questions<00:03:05.540> good<00:03:06.410> lens

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.510
