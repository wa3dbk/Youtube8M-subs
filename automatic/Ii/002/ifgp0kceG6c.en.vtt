00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.500
 endless Trotter I have already created an application here as I now too 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.300
 We would like to lead Flash over some previous killing 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.150
 See how you can easily do this through Copy &amp; Case 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.930
 but here I want a second one 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.199
 imagine a much better way 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.689
 First of all some hints, we have a background in the procedure 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.720
 is a symbol and has assigned this plot to Shadow that 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.739
 I can continue to understand here in the broadcast 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.839
 I also have my Lupul here 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.170
 The transparency mode takes soft light 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.640
 and last but not least the background 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.420
 and go to the cut surface tool to make a new cut here 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.929
 Create my application later in meat will not be too big 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.620
 With this information I save my Lust Rato graphics now 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.720
 and return to meat 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.710
 Families meat that for a new flyer district Schuster 3 standard 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.600
 want to create 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.329
 and just import children on party 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.390
 and say port in stage 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.619
 I choose my saved - Strato power goes out to open 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.130
 And now I have a very extensive dialogue 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 to configure individual levels during import 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.710
 First, we have the text from our search box here text above 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.790
 I can now say that it wants to import some sort of exit 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.750
 the text should remain editable 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.090
 Vector contours are to be converted 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.440
 or no bittner 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.650
 Of course, I want to import it as editable and text 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.320
 In addition, I would like to give him Wicked name and say here this is mine 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 Sirch text 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
 so I can edit the later via Action Script 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.270
 we see the magnifying glass finally given the properties including 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.619
 Has 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.430
 that this will not be taken over just like that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.840
 Whenever this exclamation point comes, meat meets an object 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.760
 Can not take water anymore 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.210
 Shamelessly, incompatibility report is one we see here 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.400
 because property mix rich light does not work 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.970
 we can now decide if he wants to throw this property there or 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.770
 whether we want to import the whole thing instead as a petitioner 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 but just got the look but I get an imaging afterwards 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.509
 we also have the various graphic properties here like my Barton 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.569
 Also this one can not import as editable and color or as a companion 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.839
 in the case gorgeous in quite like to receive as a father 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.989
 just like the text box itself and you can do that for every element 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.739
 To stop a novelty so called instance we would create here 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.089
 Example says FÃ¶rtsch 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.999
 underlined MC 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.099
 All the information you already know meat entered here 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.990
 Example instance name for mine 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.130
 still in the coat of arms 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.699
 No, of course, automatically taken over 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.370
 further down in Gaza 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.760
 and here we look at the text character of a here too I want 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.980
 like to edit it as editable and import text and give a music clip name 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.609
 on 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.119
 If you want you can also change the registration in the meat 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:02.189
 just click on a lamento and who here the new registration 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.709
 prompt for meat 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.760
 they both have alimony they can say 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.700
 as she just wants to convert either in flash levels 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.480
 in single keyframes Wassenberg sda rotten animation is suitable or 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.050
 all levels and objects 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.039
 in a flat together 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.759
 Of course, I want to get the rest rate levels here, that is, I get 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.990
 just for background Bartens Pop Navi 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.879
 and up here for my SPOX 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:27.899
 I would also like to 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.319
 make my stage the same size as my Illustrator drawing surface 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.459
 or the cutting area I just had in the mood 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.669
 forgive 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:40.319
 By doing this, my bundle will also mark a size of 550 Apex lat 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.329
 this value is stated below fair 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.739
 if you have used symbols in Illustrator they are not on the characters 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.529
 So you can still have them in the library with empathy 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.079
 a 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.469
 Lastly, they have the option of not having any Peter to import 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.019
 I will advise against it first but first 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.160
 click on OK 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.779
 and now imported 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:03.479
 all my Illustrator document and we see, for example, my loupe here 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.279
 which was imported as a picture 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.299
 Now you will not only find these elements on the sign surface where we are now 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.160
 here have the individual levels 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.320
 but they also find these elements in the library 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.790
 Baldi libraries a bit bigger and look here 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.859
 in the industry or import a flyer stadium after 8 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.139
 Here, all elements therefore direct SPOX as for example 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:24.860
 My picture 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 or the individual movie clips 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.650
 In principle, Fleischmann imports all symbols from Lust Rato 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.020
 and restores them as much as possible 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 The magnifying glass did not work for his bittner 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.199
 charming but because instead our background 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.620
 if we go to the filters here we will see the flair sports granny table 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.650
 Drop Shadow has also added many of the transparency feature 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.360
 their way to Flash in the formally waiting for the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.509
 and mark the little house here 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.289
 in the on the properties then we see that the color here on 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.659
 "Advanced" is when we go to setting Demel is alpha channel 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.439
 here stand at 75 percent 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.469
 This is also pre-set by Illustrator 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.419
 if you prefer the fast way via copy &amp; waste you can do it 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.340
 change the preset 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.610
 in them on edit presets and they get here 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.749
 now the Arc will display the import program in the categories 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.719
 Here you can specify exactly how understand Trotter files when 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:25.759
 Import treated 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.949
 For example, you can tell if hidden the layers with imported 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.249
 should have in which form texts to be ported the color pictures 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.539
 or should have imported groups 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.460
 the fast way to work your passport because I always preferred it 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.169
 when I use my graphic in Illustrator for most of Flash 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.360
 have prepared 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.710
 I have in Illustrator 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.910
 still no symbols created or no instances instances wither instance took 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.009
 then I would work here via the file import function
