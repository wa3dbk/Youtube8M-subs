00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.710
 Visitor all to a new episode of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.899
 Five-finger minecraft you do not yet 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.250
 did not know five things again today 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.170
 have chosen more from the comments 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.160
 You're back if you're still good 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.719
 Ideas have these written down 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 comments and ratings well says that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 thumb up it took the easier 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.490
 to pick out and the probability 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 bigger that they come 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.300
 and yes, I want to say yes 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 go with the first story and big 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.800
 then talk the first cracked a correction 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.480
 of me as last time 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 you can somehow be underlaid 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.869
 struck by chance depending on how 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 the lava flowed over it when is here 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.040
 I can put myself on the purchase page 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.440
 actually put in and penn in lava 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.879
 Anyway, probably because 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 here in small air hole was in it or 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.290
 I do not know anything like that then 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.160
 next or the actual 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.649
 first thing from kenya kiev following him 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 I noticed that when I am again 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 spawn in lava for example me two 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 Seconds from harm 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 eat healthy response country in here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.899
 I can swim around I'm completely open 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.430
 with war 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.629
 he is after two seconds I found 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.199
 apparently to get and that happens 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.710
 that time 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.750
 after in lava respawn I respectfully 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.790
 dive but not supposed to actually 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 that is a kind of spawn protection but 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.130
 somehow then grow again 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.260
 or as I read 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.760
 So that means when you're back 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 respawn you can do it in two 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.950
 sekÃ¼ndchen when one hops hold out 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 except lama and out again 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.729
 means you can directly named bonn two 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.380
 get himself and the child as it looks 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.299
 and it should be every time so therefore be 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.710
 no matter if you get hurt or if 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.450
 you now old lover dived the similar 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.479
 is true then the next thing is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 from picco or pitt co when you die 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.259
 Interchange automatic first slot 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 So it looks like all will 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.270
 inventory things reset I have it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.409
 on the third last third slot 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 if I look over the rheinblick and now 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.369
 the g + switch will turn off automatically 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
 at first but not really nothing 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.479
 that's really true now 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.350
 I did not work for a short time 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.180
 the 85 again die in and change 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 immediately on the first over so without 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.520
 Intention actually and only eight man 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.780
 pay attention not to be on it and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 the whole sense just understood that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 you character reset similar again 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.180
 but the spots are dying 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.130
 by change 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.530
 ok the next one is from titus lp if you have one 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.750
 one six blocks in half always comes 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.489
 only the larger number so far as one 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 a kind of stack has an odd one 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.069
 pay within myself so if so 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.870
 cut the 32 in half and then once with 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.610
 right click semi-half out of retirement 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.530
 then I will always the higher number 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.170
 knows of an odd number is 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.819
 have had hand and the whole was again 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.489
 reasonably valued and I test 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.019
 a try I eg 263 tnt 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.060
 put not hit right 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.340
 I get 32 out of the trade 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.560
 is the bigger part of the stick than that 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.120
 so what is left when her 31 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.010
 I have to halve this again 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.640
 the 16 of the hand is the bigger part than 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.180
 15 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.440
 which 15 halves i have to go now 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.790
 Practically eighth hand that the larger one 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.200
 as you are seven and now you have to 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.660
 get four years and three 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.580
 Remain exactly from the 30 2 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.350
 get a skeleton left that is called 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.060
 always pulls the bigger part of one 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.530
 Odd stacks out when you get the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.850
 function of halving it is used 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.160
 now clearly that pay an odd 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.870
 to share with it but it follows one 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.840
 directly into the system you always get the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.190
 larger number of tnt or objects 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.640
 in the hand exactly 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.579
 next we go next one 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.700
 Matter of multiplayer writes the ender 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.070
 beads or thrown ender beads through 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.180
 tnt change your trajectory if it is 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.060
 The entertain would have exploded 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.500
 fly by and I should use it if 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.000
 a factor still makes a profit 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.220
 greet the class 6d in berlin 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.190
 I've got it all this way 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.150
 tried a little bit tested and 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.230
 Unfortunately I can not get it to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.239
 demonstrate 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.370
 but I know that it's because I like it 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.680
 ever before in a long time 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 art tutorial seen or a video 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.500
 and I believe that after swf 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.840
 sound or so that sometimes tested 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.030
 because of such a small country created 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.400
 which he is extremely far 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.410
 catapulted by simply ender 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.540
 beads that you threw with the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.630
 explosions practically in the sense of one 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.790
 circuit has set correctly and there 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.260
 the trajectory of it was changed so 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.150
 I know I will have even the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.570
 Winkelmann l try timing easy 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.440
 with tnt and then I should 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.340
 throw a ball 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.930
 that 's hard to share 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.639
 I have a lot of time next now 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.740
 tinkering redstone is already 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.820
 pretty late but I know that it works 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.760
 That's why I would mention 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.500
 and perhaps someone has an idea 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.210
 as you can already show it 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.910
 maybe you could just briefly 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.770
 but with three take anyway ender 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.990
 beads or trajectory of enr vacation or 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.560
 entities are affected by tnt 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.210
 exploded on then goes the last one 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.130
 for me today is a story 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.000
 noticed at a farc the 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.770
 actually was wrong 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.510
 and here actually says that if 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.700
 one then shoots himself in the air 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.350
 between kindes or dies then again 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.020
 respawn before the npd goes down 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.340
 it was fallen that you then at the place 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.900
 revived where the shares on 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.520
 hit but when testing me 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.050
 noticed that the elle is deleted 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.669
 Should one die and I knew that 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.360
 not yet and that's why it shows 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.370
 gardner with 18 / you can respawn yes 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.310
 one certainly still tested with everyone 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.800
 lot of stuff before for the following i en 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.919
 appel up annoying as close completely 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.510
 fast kilmer and response he is gone 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.340
 and it takes longer to fall 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.110
 clearly has not fallen yet 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.160
 Throw wait wait wait wait 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.740
 wait wait wait wait and wait 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.680
 now the whole as I said again to 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.840
 throw up kill respawn and she is gone 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.099
 So completely an appeal and a thing 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.190
 never throws me so throws why 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.419
 faith mutes also omitted 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.979
 you can not be dismantled again 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.330
 because you want to die the ender 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.110
 pearl in the air automatically 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.510
 Clear 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.940
 and yes then also been fixed already 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.110
 from the story I have 15 again 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.430
 suppose I have one again today 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.300
 a few problems had good things 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.860
 to find out 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.820
 Nonetheless, maybe there is 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.740
 a little something again next week 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.510
 better with it I 'm a quiz too 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.880
 look and then we see already in the 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.120
 leave next part until then and 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.120
 bye
