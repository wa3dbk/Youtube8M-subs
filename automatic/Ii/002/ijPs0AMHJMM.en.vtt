00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.370
 mostly cover it 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.420
 any advance of any other 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 team 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.309
 that we lowered the racism theory and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.639
 problems calculating has that inertia 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.070
 although it makes respectable asked not what 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.279
 you can do by marking yourself 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.279
 speed 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.100
 which obviously indicates that 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.290
 tonight it's getting dark and it 's 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.510
 taking control control now and 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.630
 martín martín has told me sabanés that 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.570
 will pass the one that then the area another part 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.550
 the one of the rise probably or the one of the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.370
 exit of the tunnel that will be an area not 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.520
 You can put a little more if you can 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.550
 its power the passage these also 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.890
 looking for a better placement of these 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.220
 make you go looking also not to lose 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.140
 a good placement in this arrival 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.589
 can enter for the last time and to the square 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.589
 of concord 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 and up there as we said 2 kilometers 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.960
 200 meters 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 so what is happening is very good 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.560
 now you can also that outer part 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 of the set bows and hands 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.090
 so that I'm a bit misplaced but 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.899
 I think they have time with 2 km of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.899
 try to progress 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.980
 since I have not got a match that is 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.710
 a team from austral 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.110
 30 minutes indicate now for the start 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.890
 of these 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.890
 Celebrations 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.650
 the last 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.050
 50 for once I turned around for not 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.920
 to have 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.920
 and in 52 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.320
 to mark everything there you want 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.940
 that does not have any equipment marking the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.370
 hour when you see that they squeeze you like 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.350
 I was doing material program 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.229
 thirty-something boats for a little dot 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.060
 plus one more dot for the time that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.200
 is coming we see ourselves being equated 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 and hand so the hardest 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.519
 of four runners is imposing 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.349
 anyway it takes the most form 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:32.930
 fast on the outside runners 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:32.930
 from the omega 3 final set get here 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.980
 and that he could not enter has been set aside 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.510
 partner to see if someone else could 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.430
 approach and good what good work they are 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.690
 doing also to try to carry 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.850
 something closer to unless you can 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.709
 take the row because it 's cavendish 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.260
 sagan hosting the wheel and also has 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.670
 caught christophe very well and there he is 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.650
 also this that seems like he wants 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.640
 progress imposed imposed some position 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.000
 to that section 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 buschi 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.920
 it is terrible 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.060
 just because it's going to stay a lot 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.010
 l 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:45.069
 and let's see how cavendish is getting 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.290
 in the interior let's see if it has 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.980
 hollow because he thinks he's coming out 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.980
 outside 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.050
 the 4 impressive stage wins 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.700
 and now look at Cuba 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.250
 because really that high stick 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.250
 buts 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.470
 the fourth triumph of youtube 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.239
 it's awesome was unimaginable 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.220
 I understand that it is more career but a little 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.810
 in the line of law times in the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.810
 last year in the return type is Spain 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.790
 if it has not come out 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.160
 together 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.160
 great success achieved with 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.409
 altogether 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.230
 totally logical joy 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.540
 since you have seen 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.570
 meet is a way that
