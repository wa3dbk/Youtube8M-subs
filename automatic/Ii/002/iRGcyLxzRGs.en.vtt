00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:10.440
 the next task c6 I do not know where 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.809
 solve the equation of natural numbers you 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 such problems are related to the theory 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.369
 divisibility of the comparison sight modulo 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 can do and more simple 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.220
 means if you are not familiar with 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.010
 module comparisons just knowing 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.250
 some concepts of the theory of divisibility 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 for example here on the left side 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.260
 the remainder of dividing by 3 should be 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 equal to one according to the right 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:43.160
 Part 3 of the bath when natural n is divided 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:51.020
 at 13 the remainder is zero therefore 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.020
 the remainder is the separation of this number by 3 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.829
 must be equal to unity and generally 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.829
 saying belongs to integers 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.200
 easy to guess what to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.860
 get the rest you need to take 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:22.000
 it's even easy to come to this 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:26.040
 the fact is that two is three minus 1 if 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.710
 we raise this difference to degree m 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.200
 there was a bunch of items m plus one 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.539
 Addend where will be the grade three 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 binomial coefficients and all ponies 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.720
 triples will multiply with powers 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.369
 minus one and last degree 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.070
 will be -1 to you so that she 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:54.090
 turned into + 1 as was to the candy 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 goy not on 3 n should be an even number 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.990
 I hope it is clear that you need to take m equal 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.049
 2 to where to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 also a natural number if you substitute 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.500
 this is n equal to 2 whom the original equation 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:21.420
 it will turn out 2 to degree 2 to 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.420
 -3 bath equals one 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.420
 Now we will transfer the top three to the right 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:37.290
 part a unit left and then 20 you are not 2 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 k minus 1 will be equal to 3 washing well and 2 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:48.260
 in degree 2 k is the square of the number 20 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:54.530
 titanic for it turns out that two in kata 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.530
 -1 ends pen very on time 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:07.010
 such includes that 2 in k -1 difference 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:10.609
 multiplied by the sum of these numbers 2 per roll 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.049
 plus 15 difference of squares 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.690
 presents the product of the sum and 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:21.150
 the differences 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:24.030
 by 3 it turned out that two factors in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.980
 the left side represent in 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.769
 the work 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.319
 degree of three means each of these 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.560
 multipliers in itself can too 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.489
 represent a troika degree 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:47.280
 that is, take my references can be written 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:53.669
 system love to the Palisades is at in 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.660
 to some extent x 2 wko you minus 1 this 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:07.340
 3 to degree y 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:11.630
 naturally x plus y is equal to l xy all 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.420
 say z plus but all natural it 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.519
 their possible values 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.090
 then you can still a few strict hand 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.310
 so hold 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:27.290
 Well, probably so it is clear that you need to find 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:33.520
 such x and y that threesome erected 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:39.140
 corresponding degree in the first case 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.010
 In case of xx , an account must be attributed to x 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.240
 more y 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.140
 since the bracket is bigger than this so here 2 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.500
 the degrees of the three must be apart 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.810
 differ by 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:58.310
 if you subtract from the first equation the second 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:04.160
 you get 3 to the power of x minus 3 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:07.130
 degree y equals two think very 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.590
 just add up the degree to find such 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:14.960
 degrees only one pair 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.330
 3 in 1 as x equals 13 0 2 neighbors and 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.690
 degrees of three the distance between which 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:28.060
 equal to home so miracle of evidence follows 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:35.730
 that x is 1 not grig 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.730
 is zero but since x + y is like 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:52.650
 put the application n the sum n equals 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:52.650
 one times n is one 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.080
 it turns out this barren canteen 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:07.780
 Plain 2 is a huge minus 3 equals 1 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:17.460
 from where it can be done by simple manipulations 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:17.460
 get m equal to 2 so the answer 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.840
 this is 1 m equals
