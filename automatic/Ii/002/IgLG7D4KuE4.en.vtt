00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and just cut a round stic now this could

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.130 
and just cut a round stic now this could
be<00:01:10.080> harder<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:11.220> people<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.700> others

obviously

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
obviously

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.809

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
through he'll probably be like this

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.360 
through he'll probably be like this
holding<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.019> up<00:03:48.110> against<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.620> light<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.250> you

so I also got some blue cryptic and like
this<00:05:15.459> as<00:05:15.729> long<00:05:15.759> as<00:05:16.059> you<00:05:16.179> just<00:05:16.329> hold<00:05:16.539> it<00:05:16.659> up<00:05:16.749> so

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
this as long as you just hold it up so

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.719 
this as long as you just hold it up so
light<00:05:17.199> you're<00:05:17.919> going<00:05:18.069> to<00:05:18.129> be<00:05:18.249> able<00:05:18.309> to<00:05:18.519> see

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
light you're going to be able to see

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.239 
light you're going to be able to see
through<00:05:18.969> it<00:05:19.059> with<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.479> whole<00:05:19.659> spindles<00:05:20.469> you

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:21.249 
through it with the whole spindles you

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:22.859 
through it with the whole spindles you
won't<00:05:21.459> have<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.819> screws<00:05:22.119> in<00:05:22.389> there<00:05:22.539> so<00:05:22.749> you

00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:22.869 
won't have the screws in there so you

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:26.669 
won't have the screws in there so you
can<00:05:23.019> just<00:05:23.199> see<00:05:23.409> through<00:05:23.679> it<00:05:25.259> so<00:05:26.259> once<00:05:26.499> you<00:05:26.649> have

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:26.679 
can just see through it so once you have

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:29.549 
can just see through it so once you have
all<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.399> whole<00:05:27.610> room<00:05:28.119> it<00:05:28.449> will<00:05:29.229> look

all the whole room it will look

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:32.159 
all the whole room it will look
something<00:05:29.799> like<00:05:29.949> this<00:05:30.099> probably<00:05:30.639> and<00:05:31.119> if<00:05:32.019> you

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
something like this probably and if you

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.559 
something like this probably and if you
don't<00:05:32.439> do<00:05:33.069> this<00:05:33.339> part<00:05:33.669> with<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.879> holes<00:05:34.119> it

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
don't do this part with the holes it

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.969 
don't do this part with the holes it
will<00:05:35.259> still<00:05:35.709> work<00:05:35.739> but<00:05:37.289> sometimes<00:05:38.289> like<00:05:38.799> on

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
will still work but sometimes like on

will still work but sometimes like on
the<00:05:39.129> dips<00:05:39.399> it'll<00:05:40.389> start<00:05:40.629> to<00:05:40.689> peel<00:05:41.259> like<00:05:43.019> type

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:44.019
