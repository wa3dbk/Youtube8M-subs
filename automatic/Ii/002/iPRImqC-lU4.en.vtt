 Hi, what 's up all the good techno jd 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.500
 today I wanted to make a small 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.119
 news about the jailbreak 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.630
 of 16 13 well there's no one I'll serve yet 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.090
 ante ter seems for this firmware but 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.030
 It seems that they have succeeded in making a 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.070
 there is a famous front you think 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.680
 I'm not 100% sure there has been a 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.020
 video where they show that if this does not 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.210
 I mention it for the people the 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.579
 number of people who ask me if there 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.870
 or not too smart to have this 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.969
 obviously still not going to come out 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.659
 simply because it has not come out yet 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.609
 the s7 at the time the ibc 7 comes out 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.469
 there will come out in case it is 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.229
 real and that there is going to be the 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.389
 jailbreak untethered for 613 and for 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.489
 there by luck also for the 7 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:54.710
 they just do not do it because hey 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.780
 obviously if they would take it out before 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.449
 come out 17 it is very likely that you are 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.999
 giving the hint to apple of good as 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.530
 jailbreak base of 17 then good 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.840
 obviously they will not do until 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.689
 do not leave the 7 they will not release and they do not go 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 to show the jailbreak neither for 6 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.840
 matter nor for 7 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.240
 so I hope it does not come out yet and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.270
 apparently has a date even for 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 when will it come out because it's going to be 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.350
 probably September 10 going 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 to be the keynote that is going to be apple 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.780
 where will probably present the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.990
 iphone again and it also seems that they are going to 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.860
 present a low-end iphone that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.710
 it looks like it's called iphone 5 c I guess 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.070
 that chips are not cheap in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.260
 English what do I know but, but good are the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.940
 rumors that are spinning around so 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.650
 very likely I am very attentive because 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.119
 for 10 it is very likely that when 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.610
 plug into your device the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 computer someone tell you that he has 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.590
 come out the os-7 so they're very 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.970
 attentive and obviously very attentive to not 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.760
 update it 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.410
 because you have to see how to do the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.590
 jailbreak of 17 to see what 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.660
 recommendations are going to give and of course 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.369
 the people who have an iphone that 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.740
 need the jailbreak to be able to 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.070
 release it good those are the ones that more more 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.260
 important do not have update so 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.450
 very attentive to that obviously when 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.810
 come out the saber exo I'm going to make a video 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.970
 as much of hare of 16 13 as of 7 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 obviously of the two so be 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.850
 attentive good I just wanted to do 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.830
 that little update on how it came 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.520
 the hand so well we're seeing 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.520
 see you later
