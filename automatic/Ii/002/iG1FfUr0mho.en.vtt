00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
jack of hearts in this case I'll turn it

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.200 
jack of hearts in this case I'll turn it
back<00:01:30.820> over<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.600> put<00:01:32.409> two<00:01:32.649> cards<00:01:33.100> on<00:01:33.220> top<00:01:33.579> like

a<00:01:48.759> turnover<00:01:49.299> pass<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.899> video<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.409> know<00:01:50.920> it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
a turnover pass in the video I know it's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.999 
a turnover pass in the video I know it's
not<00:01:51.460> brilliant<00:01:51.759> but<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:53.049> yeah<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.530> must<00:01:53.829> point

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
not brilliant but also yeah I must point

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.600 
not brilliant but also yeah I must point
out<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.549> only<00:01:55.210> record<00:01:55.930> my<00:01:56.170> tricks<00:01:56.500> once<00:01:56.829> once

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
out I only record my tricks once once

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.270 
out I only record my tricks once once
okay<00:01:58.299> because<00:01:59.170> then<00:01:59.590> it's<00:01:59.770> almost<00:02:00.039> like<00:02:00.250> a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
okay because then it's almost like a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.359 
okay because then it's almost like a
live<00:02:00.549> performance<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.439> it's<00:02:02.649> not<00:02:02.799> like<00:02:03.039> oh

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
live performance so it's not like oh

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.469 
live performance so it's not like oh
yeah<00:02:03.909> okay<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:05.860> flash<00:02:06.430> their<00:02:06.789> back<00:02:07.299> go

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
yeah okay that I I flash their back go

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.450 
yeah okay that I I flash their back go
back<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.840> remake<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.229> video<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.740> don't<00:02:09.280> want

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
back and remake the video I don't want

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.340 
back and remake the video I don't want
to<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.970> want<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.390> make<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.930> seem<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.200> if

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
to do that I want to make it seem as if

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.620 
to do that I want to make it seem as if
it's<00:02:11.620> live<00:02:11.890> performance<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.850> you're<00:02:13.480> an

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
it's live performance and you're an

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.930 
it's live performance and you're an
actual<00:02:14.140> spectator<00:02:14.740> because<00:02:15.250> otherwise<00:02:15.520> you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
actual spectator because otherwise you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.640 
actual spectator because otherwise you
know<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.330> just

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
know it just

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.500 
know it just
seems<00:02:16.769> kind<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.069> pointless<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.640> my<00:02:17.790> eyes<00:02:18.000> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
seems kind of pointless in my eyes and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.130 
seems kind of pointless in my eyes and
to<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.670> yet<00:02:20.819> once<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.720> control<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
to do that but yet once you control it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.920 
to do that but yet once you control it
third<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.769> top<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:24.510> you're<00:02:24.629> going<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.810> do

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
third to the top what you're going to do

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.869 
third to the top what you're going to do
is<00:02:25.110> you're<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.439> have<00:02:26.129> some<00:02:26.340> nice<00:02:26.489> little

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
is you're going to have some nice little

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
on this corner here and then just let it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.550

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.530 
but push down and the card will flick up
hopefully<00:03:44.159> not<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.669> and<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.299> card

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
hopefully not like that and the card

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.539 
hopefully not like that and the card
will<00:03:45.690> flick<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:46.109> right<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:46.590> then<00:03:47.159> you<00:03:47.340> can

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
will flick up right and then you can

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.610 
will flick up right and then you can
just<00:03:47.729> place<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.180> card<00:03:48.419> underneath<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:49.440> this

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
just place this card underneath now this

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.839 
just place this card underneath now this
is<00:03:49.680> slightly<00:03:50.010> more<00:03:50.250> risky<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.329> spectator

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
is slightly more risky for a spectator

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.969 
is slightly more risky for a spectator
so<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:53.909> can<00:03:54.449> just<00:03:54.479> turn<00:03:55.109> them<00:03:55.319> over<00:03:55.409> like<00:03:55.709> this

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
so you can just turn them over like this

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.330 
so you can just turn them over like this
okay<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:57.209> you've<00:03:57.359> got<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.659> two<00:03:57.840> out<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.340> then

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
okay so you've got the two out and then

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.809 
okay so you've got the two out and then
you<00:03:59.699> just<00:03:59.940> turn<00:04:00.180> them<00:04:00.299> over<00:04:00.419> okay<00:04:00.989> that's<00:04:01.319> it

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
you just turn them over okay that's it

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.360 
you just turn them over okay that's it
and<00:04:02.870> then<00:04:03.870> basically<00:04:04.109> from<00:04:04.620> here<00:04:04.919> we<00:04:05.069> try<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
and then basically from here we try the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.939 
and then basically from here we try the
way<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.609> decide<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.269> do<00:04:06.419> it<00:04:06.599> by<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.530> way<00:04:07.680> this

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
way you decide to do it by the way this

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:16.210 
way you decide to do it by the way this
way<00:04:08.250> could<00:04:09.239> be<00:04:09.299> slightly<00:04:09.810> more<00:04:12.919> loss<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:14.099> word

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
way could be slightly more loss the word

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.089 
way could be slightly more loss the word
noticeable<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.430> spectator<00:04:18.680> however<00:04:19.680> it

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
noticeable to the spectator however it

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.029 
noticeable to the spectator however it
is<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> lot<00:04:20.699> easy<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.289> 10<00:04:22.560> times<00:04:22.800> easier

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
is a lot easy this like 10 times easier

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.760 
is a lot easy this like 10 times easier
