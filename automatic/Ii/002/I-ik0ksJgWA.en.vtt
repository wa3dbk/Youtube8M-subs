00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
sound really terrible but but yeah so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.380 
sound really terrible but but yeah so
let's<00:02:21.459> get<00:02:21.580> started

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.720 

one<00:02:29.900> second<00:02:30.290> these<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.740> need<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.400> with<00:02:31.580> that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
one second these I need it on with that

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.570 
one second these I need it on with that
up<00:02:37.570> now<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.630> definitely<00:02:39.200> can't<00:02:39.920> really<00:02:40.280> tell

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580

microphone<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:58.550> can<00:02:58.700> get<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> good<00:02:59.209> idea<00:02:59.330> of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
microphone so you can get a good idea of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.140 
microphone so you can get a good idea of
