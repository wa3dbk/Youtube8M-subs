and<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.700> scanned<00:00:36.210> him<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> study

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and when we scanned him we do a study

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799 
and when we scanned him we do a study
called<00:00:38.129> brain<00:00:38.460> SPECT<00:00:38.820> imaging<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.450> looks<00:00:39.660> at

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
called brain SPECT imaging that looks at

called brain SPECT imaging that looks at

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.690 
blood flow and activity patterns it
looks<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> brain<00:00:42.719> works<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.469> saw<00:00:44.370> just

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
looks at how the brain works we saw just

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.119 
looks at how the brain works we saw just
a<00:00:44.879> huge<00:00:45.390> deficit<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.379> his<00:00:47.070> left<00:00:47.789> temporal<00:00:48.510> lobe

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
a huge deficit in his left temporal lobe

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
a huge deficit in his left temporal lobe
and<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> time<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.969> 1995<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.989> had<00:00:52.079> already

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and at the time in 1995 we had already

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.880 
and at the time in 1995 we had already
been<00:00:52.590> doing<00:00:52.710> imaging<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.670> four<00:00:53.940> years<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.989> we

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
been doing imaging for four years and we

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
been doing imaging for four years and we
had<00:00:56.070> correlated<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> part<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> brain<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
had correlated that part of the brain to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
had correlated that part of the brain to
violence<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> tried<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.449> someone

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
violence and when I tried to get someone

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.410 
violence and when I tried to get someone
to<00:01:01.020> take<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.289> seriously<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> take<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to take it seriously and take it out the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
to take it seriously and take it out the
people<00:01:04.170> said<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.470> didn't<00:01:04.680> think<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
people said they didn't think that the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.830 
people said they didn't think that the
assist<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.150> related<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> his

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
assist was at all related to his

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530 
assist was at all related to his
behavior<00:01:07.130> well<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> felt<00:01:08.549> differently<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
behavior well I felt differently and I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.280 
behavior well I felt differently and I
finally<00:01:10.049> talked<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> dr.<00:01:10.920> Jorge<00:01:11.280> Lazaro<00:01:11.760> fit

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
finally talked to dr. Jorge Lazaro fit

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.700 
finally talked to dr. Jorge Lazaro fit
UCLA<00:01:13.290> who<00:01:13.799> said<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.729> cysts<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.710> symptomatic

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
UCLA who said when cysts are symptomatic

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.570 
UCLA who said when cysts are symptomatic
they<00:01:17.310> take<00:01:18.270> them<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.250> drained

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they take them out and so they drained

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.060 
they take them out and so they drained
Andrews<00:01:21.150> cysts<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.869> thank<00:01:22.140> God<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Andrews cysts and thank God because it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
Andrews cysts and thank God because it
was<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.460> aggressive<00:01:23.880> had<00:01:24.689> put<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.229> much

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
was so aggressive had put so much

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
was so aggressive had put so much
pressure<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.670> thin<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> bone

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
pressure that actually thin the bone

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.440 
pressure that actually thin the bone
over<00:01:27.630> his<00:01:28.380> temporal<00:01:29.340> lobe<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.939> once<00:01:30.180> they

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
over his temporal lobe and once they

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
over his temporal lobe and once they
drained<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.290> he<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.670> better<00:01:32.939> his

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
drained it he did so much better his

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
drained it he did so much better his
behavior<00:01:33.780> went<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:35.159> normal<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
behavior went back to normal now it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.179 
behavior went back to normal now it
wasn't<00:01:36.600> simple<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:37.680> had<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
wasn't simple because they had to go and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.359 
wasn't simple because they had to go and
revise<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.390> shunt<00:01:39.840> they<00:01:39.990> put<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.350> his<00:01:40.740> brain<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
revise the shunt they put in his brain a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.649 
revise the shunt they put in his brain a
