00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.919
 You know very well that we use the momentary orientation now in the United States and some 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.200
 From the ROM countries located on our very good story point and bomb pointer 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.450
 It was not as cool as a war with clear bags and Somalia Somalis somewhere that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.549
 We used it 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.319
 Uh ... but drones 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.079
 We are out there late 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.980
 Sovereignty is also a little sad day for them 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.999
 Sometimes the implementation of oh ... people that 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.050
 We probably have a legitimate terrace soon so I can play that gambling 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.829
 Everything was wrong right 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.199
 Uh ... Another we know that there are a huge number of errors in the 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.310
 The stadium killed 3,000 civilians 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.970
 In all those uh ... draws her struggling different countries and some u_s_ 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.940
 Sorry citizens without a truck 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.560
 It turns out that we are not alone 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.100
 The Chinese also have probes 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.980
 We are now reported in before but what we did not know is that these were close 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.640
 To use one of them 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.999
 To justify a person 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.740
 In a different country 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.930
 Groups 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.330
 If we can do it 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.970
 They can do it too 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.710
 So far the New York Times story shows China's concern about using an unmanned aerial vehicle 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.450
 I hit this area of ​​Southeast Asia to kill and the Lord's rug was rattled 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.159
 He wanted to kill 13 Chinese sailors 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.280
 Now look 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.150
 That this murder was a role at the moment it seemed as if they were actually on 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.650
 Spot their hands rebound 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.220
 You may have been tortured and it was the Chinese masses that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.400
 Wrath of this and they said we have her justice 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.550
 And you can not get the guy up and think about it 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.190
 Disney by the way is 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.970
 The time now is 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.830
 Wah ... so they were good 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.610
 Why not go get the guy 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.810
 If they are u_s_ and i dont so let me tell you about their QUE paragraph 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.479
 The melodies where this Chinese pulls up the style seem to be 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.920
 On the American machine and predator on many of the big real vehicles 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.860
 They were on a bill that is on the way to flying in November and they have global 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.570
 He called it the Baidu prosecution system they have 16 different satellites 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.669
 Which have been up there since 2000 

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:06.349
 They were going across Asia in the Pacific I did not use it for military purposes 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.590
 Exercises before they also have larger drones This is closer to our America are o 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.239
 Global Hook 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.809
 So 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.999
 They are not short on her SP 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:22.219

 Reports 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.119
 It is not even that interesting and a little embarrassing for us 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.389
 They even showed up a bit more force than we did 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.459
 In fact they are using troops from Thailand Myanmar 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.269
 China and so on 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.810

 Believed on the family Guy 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.279
 Then use it to actually restrict 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.419

 That Communist China can rub you in our face 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:22.909
 Haha say we are not like u_s_ killing four civilians in fact that we are 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.219
 And any relationship 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:30.749
 The situation using our army we are actually right to work 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.079
