00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.250 
me some of her beauty tips which I loved
I<00:00:43.460> actually<00:00:43.609> started<00:00:43.969> using<00:00:44.149> it<00:00:44.420> Lily<00:00:44.929> told<00:00:45.170> me

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
I actually started using it Lily told me

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.689 
I actually started using it Lily told me
that<00:00:45.409> she<00:00:45.499> puts<00:00:45.679> oil<00:00:45.920> all<00:00:46.219> over<00:00:46.429> her<00:00:46.489> body

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
that she puts oil all over her body

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.849 
that she puts oil all over her body
before<00:00:46.909> she<00:00:47.089> goes<00:00:47.179> to<00:00:47.329> sleep<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.379> have<00:00:48.710> to

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
before she goes to sleep so I have to

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.520 
before she goes to sleep so I have to
know<00:00:49.039> it's<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.550> weak<00:00:49.789> weight<00:00:50.749> so<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.229> doesn't

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
know it's a weak weight so it doesn't

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.869 
know it's a weak weight so it doesn't
think<00:00:51.649> you<00:00:51.800> do<00:00:51.949> that's<00:00:52.100> like<00:00:52.219> a<00:00:52.309> family

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
think you do that's like a family

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.790 
think you do that's like a family
tradition<00:00:53.210> or<00:00:53.719> a<00:00:53.749> recipe<00:00:54.170> that's<00:00:54.379> handed<00:00:54.710> you

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
tradition or a recipe that's handed you

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.039 
tradition or a recipe that's handed you
down<00:00:54.979> to<00:00:55.280> get<00:00:55.399> that<00:00:55.609> beautiful<00:00:55.940> fall<00:00:56.359> our<00:00:56.690> skin

I do sleep with oil on my body just to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.740
