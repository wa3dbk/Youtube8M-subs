00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
in this video I'm gonna be showing you

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.459 
in this video I'm gonna be showing you
how<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.519> complete<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.150> challenge<00:00:12.690> requiring

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
how to complete the challenge requiring

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.250 
how to complete the challenge requiring
you<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.769> kill<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.370> lever<00:00:14.580> now<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.540> find<00:00:16.049> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
you to kill the lever now to find the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.420 
you to kill the lever now to find the
lepor<00:00:16.609> there<00:00:17.609> are<00:00:17.820> three<00:00:18.980> main<00:00:19.980> differences

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
lepor there are three main differences

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.029 
lepor there are three main differences
between<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.180> leper<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.720> normal<00:00:22.109> alien<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
between the leper and a normal alien the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
between the leper and a normal alien the
most<00:00:23.340> obvious<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.380> is<00:00:25.550> that<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.449> leper<00:00:27.660> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
most obvious one is that the leper is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.859 
most obvious one is that the leper is
bigger<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.070> physically<00:00:29.640> larger<00:00:30.179> than<00:00:30.449> than

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
bigger it's physically larger than than

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.200 
bigger it's physically larger than than
the<00:00:30.990> normal<00:00:31.320> Scout<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.040> Nommo<00:00:32.430> alien<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> see

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the normal Scout the Nommo alien you see

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.389 
the normal Scout the Nommo alien you see
in<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.930> beginning<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
in the very beginning so because of this

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.889 
in the very beginning so because of this
you'll<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.550> able<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> pick<00:00:39.149> them<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you'll be able to pick them out of a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.130 
you'll be able to pick them out of a
crowd<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.469> aliens<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.550> easily<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.750> you're

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
crowd of aliens pretty easily if you're

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
crowd of aliens pretty easily if you're
in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> first<00:00:43.680> area<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.700> when<00:00:45.030> you're<00:00:45.149> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
in the first area because when you're in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.350 
in the first area because when you're in
the<00:00:45.300> first<00:00:45.539> area<00:00:45.840> only<00:00:46.260> small<00:00:47.160> Scouts<00:00:47.910> only

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the first area only small Scouts only

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
the first area only small Scouts only
small<00:00:48.840> alien<00:00:49.230> spawn<00:00:51.410> but<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
small alien spawn but if you're in the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
small alien spawn but if you're in the
area<00:00:53.430> 2<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:53.910> 3<00:00:54.239> it'll<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:55.170> bit

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
area 2 or 3 it'll be a little bit

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
area 2 or 3 it'll be a little bit
tougher<00:00:55.590> you'll<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> use<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> second

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
tougher you'll have to use the second

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.970 
tougher you'll have to use the second
two<00:00:57.270> options<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.280> second<00:00:59.640> hockey<00:00:59.789> is

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
two options but so the second hockey is

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.750 
two options but so the second hockey is
the<00:01:01.980> second<00:01:02.370> sorry

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the second sorry

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
the second sorry
difference<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.739> leper<00:01:05.070> alien<00:01:07.040> does

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
difference is that the leper alien does

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
difference is that the leper alien does
not<00:01:08.280> attack<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.600> runs<00:01:09.869> around

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
not attack you it actually runs around

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
not attack you it actually runs around
sporadically<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
sporadically so it's not going to like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.390 
sporadically so it's not going to like
come<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> actually<00:01:16.860> search

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
come to you you have to actually search

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.200 
come to you you have to actually search
for<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
for it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.530 
for it
so<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.619> an<00:01:19.740> alien<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.850> you're<00:01:21.060> doing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
so if you see an alien when you're doing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
so if you see an alien when you're doing
the<00:01:21.630> challenge<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.890> an<00:01:23.070> alien<00:01:23.490> like

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the challenge if you see an alien like

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.050 
the challenge if you see an alien like
running<00:01:24.090> away<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.369> it's<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.670> size

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
running away from you and it's the size

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.920 
running away from you and it's the size
of<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.720> hunter<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.380> size<00:01:28.619> larger<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.400> normal

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
of a hunter the size larger than normal

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.429 
of a hunter the size larger than normal
it's<00:01:30.930> probably<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> lever<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> third

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it's probably the lever now the third

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.050 
it's probably the lever now the third
difference<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:37.049> color<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.710> glows<00:01:38.100> when

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
difference is the color it glows when

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.969 
difference is the color it glows when
you<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.780> under<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> effect<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.590> feral

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you are under the effect of feral

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.819 
you are under the effect of feral
instincts<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.909> actually<00:01:42.509> glows<00:01:42.659> red<00:01:42.899> not

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
instincts it actually glows red not

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.270 
instincts it actually glows red not
orange<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.229> very<00:01:46.409> helpful<00:01:46.979> for

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
orange so that is also very helpful for

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.710 
orange so that is also very helpful for
finding<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.000> lever<00:01:49.670> that's<00:01:50.670> basically<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
finding the lever that's basically it I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
finding the lever that's basically it I
mean<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.380> those<00:01:52.649> three<00:01:52.829> things

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
mean if you know those three things

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
mean if you know those three things
finding<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> leper<00:01:54.090> isn't<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
finding the leper isn't going to be that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
finding the leper isn't going to be that
tough<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:58.009> know<00:01:59.009> when<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> beginner<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.360> had

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tough I know when I was a beginner I had

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.130 
tough I know when I was a beginner I had
no<00:02:00.930> idea

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
no idea

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.760 
no idea
I<00:02:02.200> was<00:02:02.380> looking<00:02:02.650> for<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.900> really<00:02:05.500> hope<00:02:05.620> this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
I was looking for so I really hope this

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.479 
I was looking for so I really hope this
video<00:02:05.890> helps<00:02:06.400> see<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.300> guys<00:02:07.450> later
