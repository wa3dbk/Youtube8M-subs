00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.250
 good guys I chose to come through 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 the channel because in all the next 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.349
 days will hear these topics 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 so if you do not get lost I decided 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.599
 make this video explaining each one 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.850
 But you can not even 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.830
 my wish shape is full here 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:30.140
 on top of certain plank wood that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.140
 teach called trick shape is it here 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:42.420
 It's a winning club here. 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.100
 it's two is to put one up here and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.149
 underneath the trick are they doing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.489
 another that will come more will come - in return you 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.340
 has several different streets each with 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.329
 Sure weight to have multiple bush models 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.739
 different each get out first raid 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.730
 union dance 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.369
 now the regular basis is that zone with 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.270
 left foot in front 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.540
 the right foot behind 0 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 the other base is golf with the right foot 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 front of people instead of pulling the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:33.350
 skin brings suite for example let's say 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.350
 that you be a booth right in front 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.079
 the other base behind suite back to 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:52.100
 opposite left on right front 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:55.829
 back in fake on a bench or blind end 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.790
 I'm going to the suite now a base 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.030
 contrary 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.189
 And then I turn on the slopes. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.460
 How are you, witt walking on your back? 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.590
 is trying in this direction but his 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.710
 body is facing in this direction 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.390
 Water 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.870
 Do you walk away from the backside site? 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.590
 This is to call the maneuver of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.850
 You 're coming, you kick and skate. 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.900
 so this is a backside sector I said 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.980
 I am very outgoing frontside heard site is 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.840
 different 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.810
 so I'm coming so I argued 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.890
 so in that direction stefan design will 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.760
 Kiss Kiss is the distance between the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.490
 tricks 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.580
 the sheik complain of a prayer for you 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.070
 choose from the various on bes has 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.470
 two hearts behind I can change this 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.880
 law 26 inches seven inches and you want 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:59.290
 11 most kissed votes 27 01 2009 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.950
 16 smaller the better for you to roll the ball 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.850
 as the ease and the greater you extend 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.130
 the eyes 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.480
 will byte who is the bass year 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.210
 push to make a curve 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.190
 only you press so much that the sheik 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.780
 part ended up touching the wheel 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.730
 You're going to fall, but it happens that she's going to. 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.790
 work, you go forward 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.210
 now sum of you ride the top shape 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.660
 mount top mount I come here, you see. 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.430
 what the heck so the trick is all 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.060
 underneath completely where it is 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.180
 mounted the teaching truck on its top mount 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.700
 The other way is drop trump that is what 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.990
 I'm going to have a part of the trick here in 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.890
 up and the beams below the middle 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:52.260
 on the other you get a lot more on the ground 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:56.980
 chapter that is cap is giving slide 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.710
 releasing process on this turn is 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.780
 a kayak goal when the guy does the wheel 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.040
 and speaks as is the case of fashion as is the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.020
 around the spot flash wheel reflects strong 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.260
 When does this happen on your wheel? 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.780
 watching as tac eaten framed 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.060
 so this is sport happened on the court 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.980
 The ball gets flat. It gets there. 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.550
 stop is no stay here stop 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.880
 on the part of the plan this happens when 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.700
 you give a lot of 90 degree slide with slope 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.370
 and extends and this causes the ball to 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.540
 right to run with only one part of the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.880
 UN 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.560
 so you've tried to help each time 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.680
 more than 90 degrees from the city ​​with population 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:47.100
 the smaller a slope to leave the ball 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:51.700
 rolling on evenly spreading flu 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.230
 bud you will give so we make 10 and 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.230
 not make a curve 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:00.510
 I do not want fashion to slip and the 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:04.420
 slide skateboard because it 's what I want to do 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.460
 slide there the wheel will open to the ground is 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.400
 the wheel grid this year there are times that 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.080
 have more grip has less flu and flu 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.990
 It depends however that it is made of 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.380
 hardness of the band size 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.990
 wheel and larger contact area greater flu 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.810
 a is a point of the flu call sleep it 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.240
 edp slaps that it is the point that 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.460
 Are you going to kick the friendship that point? 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.170
 there and this is also a setting to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.080
 people talk on wheels like greenpeace 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:38.410
 lenses is very abrupt she will see if 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.750
 she will soft sound the theme more aig is 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.910
 on the slide 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.920
 there you different attacks of the used of 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.110
 front 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.420
 if you like a different side you 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.700
 have to put weight on your heel is 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.100
 you only lift your fingers in the 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:59.860
 When you do that you'll fall 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:01.660
 front of uk pub tuc is the base there is a 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.280
 A person throws a river 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:11.620
 Right down, botafogo behind the coast. 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.360

 on locations that the chips have to 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.280
 same time accounting that is 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.810
