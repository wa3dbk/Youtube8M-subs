 to teach people always learn a lot 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.850
 with them is very important because the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.040
 people need to put everything into practice 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.630
 that we learned in theory put 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.630
 in practice we have the best 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.130

 much more prepared to exercise our 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.770
 function is that the only faculty that 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.870
