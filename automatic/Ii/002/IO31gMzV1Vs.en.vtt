earthquakes<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.920> knew<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.540> wasn't<00:02:19.540> gonna<00:02:19.630> get

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
earthquakes I knew it wasn't gonna get

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.020 
earthquakes I knew it wasn't gonna get
me<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.170> bad<00:02:20.380> ah<00:02:21.960> alright<00:02:22.960> so<00:02:23.700> let<00:02:24.700> me<00:02:24.820> just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
me that bad ah alright so let me just

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.420 
me that bad ah alright so let me just
recover<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.350> case<00:02:26.530> he<00:02:26.560> switches<00:02:26.980> out<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
recover just in case he switches out I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.340 
recover just in case he switches out I
guess<00:02:27.610> he's<00:02:27.760> gonna<00:02:27.940> get<00:02:28.360> rid<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.570> his<00:02:28.780> superior

guess he's gonna get rid of his superior
that's<00:02:29.650> pretty<00:02:29.920> mean<00:02:30.150> he<00:02:31.150> could<00:02:31.300> have

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
that's pretty mean he could have

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.960 
that's pretty mean he could have
switched<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:32.020> got<00:02:32.170> something<00:02:32.530> else<00:02:32.970> All
