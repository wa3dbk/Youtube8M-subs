00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.900
 and so greet all his friends it's mr 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.429
 crafter and I hope you're fine 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.469
 in any case, I'm fine 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.580
 found for a very small video 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.340
 short when I do not even know if she's going 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.570
 do a minute for how to define 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.970
 his iphone so these are so that's 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.640
 my private server a wallaby you do 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.540
 so mount spawn logically been there 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.800
 but look I can I have everything 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.579
 just loaded the spawn to make 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 so that's when we get that 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.050
 can happen somewhere else finally where I 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.019
 want us to arrive so it's easy for 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.879
 those for doing that you go where you 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.760
 want when you make your spawn in 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.670
 import like as wanted for example 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.589
 I want to remake in the same place 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.239
 already I'm going to put the ball where I 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.679
 put on compare so here we are going to land 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.480
 there on this little piece of land 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.179
 so it's simple how do I do 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.710
 do I look at the place because there 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.809
 the landreau looks at you and you 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.830
 to say that I am but here it is 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.480
 water is not seven sports your pony 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.190
 me and look now I'm leaving 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.900
 a little bit and when I will do this loose 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.350
 paul saissac this is my dream and 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.690
 will wear the same so here I am going to do 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.310
 here with a secondary tale you 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 show that it works for everyone 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.320
 not just for my part on the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.940
 cape is precisely that supposes so we 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.860
 is in my secondary account 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.600
 So here we are on my course 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.130
 secondary finally it's more my account 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.920
 primary but hey we'll call him my 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.159
 secondary account and well look this is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.469
 simple when 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.740
 so the cia and magnin to trace the 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.299
 outline where I'm going right before we see 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.250
 stopped there just before and well 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.039
 it's simple I'm just going to do this 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.439
 loose hold and look I'm drunk 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.140
 in the command stache paul and that's it I 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.149
 sounds exactly like with my contract 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490
 and magna gel the half since my account 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.950
 germany el mundo and not followed the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.409
 watch with this one the slash 7 spawn 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.569
 does not work yes I do not have access 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.520
 this order since this account there 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.649
 is not modo so we end up on 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.780
 Germany to a pure now postpone 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.970
 the spawn here and so voili voilou so 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.190
 watch out for my mr carter and so 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.450
 look we're just going to 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.829
 put where you want so I 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 puts in the middle because spawn in a 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.760
 corner of a street thing it's not too much 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.489
 So I always try to put my 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.349
 middle like this in sight looking 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.430
 well the panels also it corresponds 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.160
 we see there that if flash 7 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.109
 so here 's this pole is back 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.709
 and here you see spawn rent this 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:44.620
 art group defect machin thing so there 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:49.480
 until the trophy shit like stage 27 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.660
 country that's where it sounds that way tomorrow 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.859
 its content no it's useless in the face of this 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.750
 who makes this sony so 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.150
 So here we are, we end up with 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.639
 my women's panels and the little ones 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.139
 shocks stuff the city so here I have 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.579
 defined my spawn so look at it and 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.989
 suspect Macon is loose but paul 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.190
 important transfer of funds it's ben 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.290
 it's simple it will always come back to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.799
 same place even if I'm not gay 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.989
 fashion was worth it is always the same 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.370
 so now so we look and I 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.590
 will you go back with my account 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.250
 secondary mr carter and then 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.680
 I think we do not finish so here is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.230
 after having well fucked the skeleton 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.400
 who pissed me off and I was fine 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.989
 is fuck besides someone joins 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.080
 so now we look if I pay it 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.540
 water slash and well just his 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.860
 pack and the doors also the same so the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.060
 look i have my account in a way there 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.670
 down is normal if he does not have the same 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.590
 ski nancy because it's with the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.420
 cracked version paid version it's 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.220
 not compatible and two convoys palestine 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.080
 from germany so that's ashton 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.500
 it's simple it goes where I was finished 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.380
 my spawn is not there anymore 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.489
 here what as just before and so that's it 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.500
 must of course especially think to guide 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.180
 also his camera because otherwise it does not 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.400
 not working well 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.489
 so that's okay listen magna was done 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.879

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.880
