00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
do and then I don't really run sequences

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.130 
do and then I don't really run sequences
with<00:00:26.340> contacts<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.330> unless<00:00:27.869> I'm

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
with contacts in them unless I'm

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.919 
with contacts in them unless I'm
completely<00:00:28.800> thrilled<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.150> he's<00:00:30.420> doing

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
completely thrilled with what he's doing

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.830

with the contacts so I think one of the
problems<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.380> contacts<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.550> say<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> our

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
who's running across the top of the dog
walk<00:01:30.630> beautifully<00:01:31.200> racing<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:31.920> position

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
walk beautifully racing into position

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
walk beautifully racing into position
but<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.850> running<00:01:33.240> away<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.720> then

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
but then kind of running away well then

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.020 
but then kind of running away well then
we<00:01:33.930> need<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> work<00:01:34.290> position<00:01:34.890> right<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.850> we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
we need to work position right but if we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.319 
we need to work position right but if we
have<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> dog<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.650> most<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.670> us<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.090> or

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
have a dog like I think most of us do or

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
have a dog like I think most of us do or
at<00:01:39.420> least<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.140> had<00:01:40.590> problems<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
at least I had problems with this with

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
at least I had problems with this with
dilly<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:42.090> was<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.600> I've<00:01:43.049> got<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.439> go

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
dilly he was like I know I've got to go

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
dilly he was like I know I've got to go
into<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.920> target<00:01:44.310> position<00:01:44.759> let<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.479> really

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
into my target position let me be really

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.520 
into my target position let me be really
careful<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:48.409> rewarding<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
careful to get there well rewarding the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
careful to get there well rewarding the
target<00:01:49.920> position<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.579> only<00:01:50.790> gonna<00:01:50.939> make

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
target position that's only gonna make

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.050 
target position that's only gonna make
that<00:01:51.360> behavior<00:01:51.810> worse<00:01:51.990> okay<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.759> I'm

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
