it<00:02:24.130> kind<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.340> forces<00:02:24.730> your<00:02:25.030> opponent's<00:02:25.570> move

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890

then after white takes on c4 white had
to<00:02:42.580> move<00:02:42.790> had<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:43.900> use<00:02:44.050> an<00:02:44.200> extra<00:02:44.680> move<00:02:44.950> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
to move had they use an extra move and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
could play Bishop here to d7 if you

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.670 
could play Bishop here to d7 if you
wanted<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.760> get<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.450> rook<00:02:52.720> involved<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.320> e8

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
wanted to get this rook involved to e8

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.980 
wanted to get this rook involved to e8
or<00:02:54.040> d8<00:02:54.610> if<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.880> wanted<00:02:55.150> too<00:02:55.300> many<00:02:55.600> different

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
or d8 if you wanted too many different

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.080 
or d8 if you wanted too many different
options<00:02:56.140> but<00:02:57.070> all<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.430> these<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.610> think<00:02:57.760> are<00:02:58.030> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
options but all of these I think are a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.060 
options but all of these I think are a
little<00:02:58.120> bit<00:02:58.450> better<00:02:58.600> than<00:02:59.020> coming<00:02:59.500> back<00:02:59.770> here

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
little bit better than coming back here

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.790 
little bit better than coming back here
and<00:03:00.310> immediately<00:03:00.790> playing<00:03:01.180> upon<00:03:02.110> taking<00:03:02.410> here

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
and immediately playing upon taking here

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.830 
and immediately playing upon taking here
on<00:03:02.920> c4<00:03:03.400> it's<00:03:03.610> not<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> horrible<00:03:04.360> move<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.780> do

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
on c4 it's not a horrible move but I do

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.600 
on c4 it's not a horrible move but I do
think<00:03:05.230> there<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> small<00:03:05.950> improvement<00:03:06.250> by

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
think there is a small improvement by

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.030 
think there is a small improvement by
playing<00:03:07.030> something<00:03:07.600> else<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.500> after<00:03:08.860> Bishop

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
playing something else but after Bishop

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.160 
playing something else but after Bishop
feared<00:03:09.340> taking<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:09.910> c4<00:03:10.450> gaining<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.960> little

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
feared taking on c4 gaining that little

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.790 
feared taking on c4 gaining that little
tempo<00:03:11.440> pawn<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.490> a<00:03:12.520> c5<00:03:13.330> just<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.260> little<00:03:14.470> nice
