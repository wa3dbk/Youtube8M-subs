00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.520
 gta 5 languages online and in this case 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.259
 I bring you a trick in which I am going to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.120
 teach how to be able to fly with our 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.280
 character arrived you will not remember what he does 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 just one week two weeks went up 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.490
 a video in which he taught us how to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.049
 to be able to fly but in that case it was like 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.580
 fly with a car is worth and well 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.949
 also a point in favor of this trick 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 I'm going to teach next is that no 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 we need the help of nobody is worth it 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.380
 we can do completely alone and very 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.820
 guys because the location is just 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.199
 the same as in the other video that does 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.849
 just a second week of how 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.650
 talking with the car is just the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 location next to the garage that has 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 almost everyone in the little door that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.570
 and Well anyway I leave the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.280
 screen location per second is not 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.960
 Agrees and nothing, just in that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.579
 door what we will have to do 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 basically to fly as superman by 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.680
 the airs will be put inside the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.260
 house is worth and being inside the house 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.760
 we have to open the left door and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.770
 when we see the left door 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 we have to press the r1 l1 a memory 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.129
 to the same button that you pressed 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 cover yourself on the wall I think the lr one 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 so then nothing, we press the r1 and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.440
 then you will see that the character 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.520
 cover well, there will be some control 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 moment there are times that it does not come out and times 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.570
 that if it comes out but there will be a moment in the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.120
 which character if you look 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.040
 intense r1 and you try to show up for the 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.900
 street is to say with the left joystick 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 for the right then remember the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.260
 buttons that press the re one to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 cover and elliot and left to have 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.930
 that turn it to the right then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.490
 then sometimes an apex of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.560
 book in which you can be boiling what 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.300
 same on screen that we just left 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.070
 above the highest point that can be 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.479
 be in gta 5 online and the truth that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.160
 quite amazing enough to leave from 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.170
 up there without any helicopter and 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.340
 cities and no plane but leave everything 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.020
 superman like you have you 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.460
 you feel like a wildcard as if 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.660
 you were superman then I put in 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.400
 dollars that is pretty pretty cool 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.600
 and as I say basically there are times that 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.979
 it comes out there are times that it does not come out and then 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 Well what you have to do is try and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.190
 as I say you have to put yourself in the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.570
 that's giving him to read e 1 and when 6 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.399
 because with the joystick or left you have 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.229
 to give to the right as if you 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.940
 would you like to appear for the street then 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.200
 Well, as I say it is search and where 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.820
 is seeing that it is super cool not to fly 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.020
 up there through the clouds and such with 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700
 he to remove the truth is super 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.720
 pimp there is a boy basically this has 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.330
 been the whole truth or something pretty 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.220
 pretty amazing I hope that what 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.509
 do because it's pretty cool a 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.649
 attic basically this has been all as 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.509
 I say I hope especially this video and 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.860
