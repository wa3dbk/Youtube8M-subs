00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
normal we knew that ok this is really

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
normal we knew that ok this is really
becoming<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.440> issue<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.309> weight<00:01:02.460> loss

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
becoming an issue all the weight loss

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.219 
becoming an issue all the weight loss
and<00:01:02.699> diet<00:01:03.000> programs<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.660> tried<00:01:03.960> they

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and diet programs that I tried they

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
and diet programs that I tried they
weren't<00:01:04.559> working<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:06.180> why<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
weren't working and so that's why I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
weren't working and so that's why I
consulted<00:01:07.320> dr.<00:01:07.560> Hart<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> Atlanta

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
consulted dr. Hart and the Atlanta

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
consulted dr. Hart and the Atlanta
bariatric<00:01:09.150> people<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.350> came<00:01:10.530> up

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
bariatric people and and they came up

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.340 
bariatric people and and they came up
with<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> idea<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> realize<00:01:11.909> band<00:01:12.350> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
with the idea of the realize band so

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.750 
with the idea of the realize band so
what<00:01:13.500> happens<00:01:13.890> when<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.100> placed<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> band

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
what happens when we placed the band

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.460 
what happens when we placed the band
effectively<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:15.689> making<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> stomach

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
effectively we're making the stomach

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
effectively we're making the stomach
much<00:01:16.650> smaller<00:01:17.040> instead<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> stomach<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
much smaller instead of a stomach the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
much smaller instead of a stomach the
size<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.350> bottle<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:20.520> making<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
size of a water bottle for making the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
size of a water bottle for making the
stomach<00:01:21.210> down<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.020> imagine<00:01:22.259> maybe

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
stomach down to it you can imagine maybe

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
stomach down to it you can imagine maybe
the<00:01:22.830> size<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> golf<00:01:23.460> ball<00:01:23.580> Jamie<00:01:24.299> already

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the size of a golf ball Jamie already

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.890 
the size of a golf ball Jamie already
had<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.710> exercise<00:01:26.189> component<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.299> his

had the exercise component down and his
food<00:01:28.140> choices<00:01:28.470> were<00:01:28.740> pretty<00:01:28.950> good<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.430> he<00:01:29.579> had

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
food choices were pretty good but he had

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
food choices were pretty good but he had
a<00:01:29.729> problem<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.119> volume<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> band

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
a problem with volume so with the band

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
a problem with volume so with the band
were<00:01:32.430> able<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.150> limit<00:01:33.780> his<00:01:34.079> volume<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
were able to really limit his volume and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.010 
were able to really limit his volume and
still<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.220> him<00:01:35.369> feel<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:36.479> he's<00:01:36.720> getting

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
full and today the plate size is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.120 
full and today the plate size is
actually<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.680> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
ounces at a meal this is the man that I

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.770 
ounces at a meal this is the man that I
met<00:02:03.930> 17<00:02:04.590> years<00:02:04.829> ago<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:06.000> difficult<00:02:06.420> part<00:02:06.450> for

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
met 17 years ago the difficult part for

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.710 
met 17 years ago the difficult part for
me<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.289> my<00:02:07.829> travel<00:02:08.310> schedule<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:09.269> a<00:02:09.450> little

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
me is my travel schedule it's a little

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.680 
me is my travel schedule it's a little
more<00:02:09.899> difficult<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:11.060> discipline<00:02:12.060> yourself<00:02:12.209> on

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
more difficult to discipline yourself on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:22.430 
more difficult to discipline yourself on
the<00:02:12.840> road<00:02:18.260> now<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.590> years<00:02:19.950> past<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:21.440> probably

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
the road now in years past I probably

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.309 
the road now in years past I probably
would<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.769> had<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> plate<00:02:23.280> full<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.519> bacon<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
would have had a plate full of bacon and

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.690 
would have had a plate full of bacon and
then<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.380> probably<00:02:25.769> gone<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.130> another<00:02:26.430> plate

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
then I probably gone back another plate

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.850 
then I probably gone back another plate
put<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> full<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.450> eggs<00:02:27.660> but<00:02:28.349> again<00:02:28.590> now

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
put that full of eggs but again now

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.240 
put that full of eggs but again now
because<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.849> only<00:02:29.940> consume<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.720> much

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
because you can only consume so much

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.800 
because you can only consume so much
this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.580> we're<00:02:32.760> stuck<00:02:32.970> with<00:02:33.000> my

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
this is what we're stuck with my

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.920 
this is what we're stuck with my
consumption<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.530> down<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.519> that's<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.390> part<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
consumption is down so that's a part of

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.309 
consumption is down so that's a part of
it<00:02:37.080> exercise<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.310> also<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:39.030> big<00:02:39.480> part<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.989> you

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
it exercise is also a big part of it you

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.080 
it exercise is also a big part of it you
know<00:02:40.349> after<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> great<00:02:40.890> breakfast<00:02:41.430> now<00:02:41.880> it's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
know after a great breakfast now it's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.690 
know after a great breakfast now it's
time<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.450> burn<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.810> off<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.700> nothing

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
time to burn it off and so nothing

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.550 
time to burn it off and so nothing
better<00:02:44.819> than<00:02:45.030> coming<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.690> feel<00:02:46.380> it'll
