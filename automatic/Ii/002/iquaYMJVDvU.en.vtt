 there are always and now have 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.970
 we as get in the battlefield 4 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 pc-version hey guys really here 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.540
 Welcome back to the other video and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.389
 today a little update to battlefield 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.119
 4 There was a new patch recently 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.359
 So the community testament patch and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.100
 although number one hundred celebration 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.140
 patch so seen because it is the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 hundredth patch the dice meanwhile 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 has been published and hereby 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.640
 certain say adapted to what 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.869
 for the community test map concerns 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.520
 Here was a bit with the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.079
 jungle lok and folie packed on it 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 various vehicles like a helicopter 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.059
 added or weapons updates to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.100
 For example, the frame of the tv must be in 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.379
 they do not seem to bring them anymore 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 really dustin that means by the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.469
 By flying you know about vehicles 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.450
 that you probably have with native 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.190
 shot and this more or less 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.199
 through the vehicle flown through or 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.039
 just goes the test and has no 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.840
 caused damage 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.100
 Such things have now been fixed what 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 but a bit more interesting 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 is next to the whole story is the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 fact that Julian is one of our 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.670
 best known dice employee just that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.200
 easter eggs alleged small note 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.180
 has given that it is a surprise 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.130
 will give and indeed is this 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.040
 probably another Easter egg in the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.170
 frame the battlefield 4 ce alone the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 post the patch from him with the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 various image what a well a holy 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.509
 probably should point to it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.700
 conclude that here is such a small one 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.950
 Butt or hint in it is hey people 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.680
 you can watch eighth what could in the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 deep of the ocean, he says slumbering 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909
 also takes care of people when you are in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.470
 was southern waters are traveling 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.600
 there could be something there is a hint 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.119
 it is another megalodon 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.650
 Note on a kraken the guess 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.210
 are here of course and the question 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.259
 what could it be? 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.420
 as you may already know 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.329
 it was not that long ago 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.520
 time the fund of an animated shark 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.350
 the former times in paris storm on the way 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.270
 should be and then took that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.740
 So hit the web ninjas strike 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.329
 misplaced where you and we them there 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 of course, have found it provides 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.740
 of course there is a question 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.630
 second megalodon there is a kraken 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.360
 as many have suspected 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.099
 continue what was here at the Rector 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.739
 issued here it was said that was 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.599
 has probably contributed to a part 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.620
 this easter egg is a bit far 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.930
 now to 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.970
 shave or watch one of his videos 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.959
 the abutting has given this it is 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.640
 now here with the game too 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.260
 can also be implemented 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.819
 not really sure about what it is 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.140
 this was only the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.209
 Note that it is on a 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.790
 his favorite map should be and that 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.379
 is on the one hand either green peak what 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.500
 also with one of my favorite maps is 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.230
 then propaganda and last but not least 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.790
 parisse storm and Bavarian storm 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.959
 Should he be this blow of the time 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.849
 but never really was laid 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.200
 was published just be 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.540
 drive and it turns 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.569
 Of course the question is on Perry's storm 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.129
 now in this label another one 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.840
 been joined to into monster 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.970
 maybe a megalodon as usual 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.010
 mentioned it is zte that means it is 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.920
 only in the city so in the community 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.450
 testaments available since the current of 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.040
 patch is running and the important thing is 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.560
 Also to mention that it only 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.180
 on an official zte server 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.349
 can be well 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.299
 this has now been live, for example 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.959
 just abandoned streams of julien 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.370
 that it is on an official zte 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.079
 testserver is located and not on 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.519
 any private servers and also 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.130
 An important note about it will be 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.620
 really not be a stripped-down puzzle 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 but it will probably turn up and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.459
 can be triggered if you completely 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.019
 normally plays the game and not 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.239
 any overly difficult 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.160
 tasks such as setting five people to die 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.480
 scratching his ass and telling it 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.139
 people at the same time with the parachute 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.700
 jump off 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.829
 then somehow from a formation 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.359
 Mickey mouse forms should be such 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.919
 Otherwise things would not be fun 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.470
 but you should play normal 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.660
 play and thereby also somewhere 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.569
 the part wears and just ex rector 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.970
 Should he do this appropriate thing 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.190
 Whatever it is supposed to be, resp 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.989
 the trigger for it was also recognized 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.790
 then know what it is 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.790
 of course the question is it is 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.859
 depending on one person this event 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.709
 to trigger this easter egg white new 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.030
 arrival expect or unconsciously I say 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.560
 now, of course, because he still is 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.449
 do not know what is what it is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.099
 acting when he sees it would be natural 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.359
 a bit sad if that depends 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.169
 would be from a person 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.989
 since that's a bit too 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.000
 thank you to the community work of 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.470
 pages of diverse people now rival 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.060
 x-factor but there I am in any case 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.950
 wondering what the finally out 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.409
 and if it is really there 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.200
 a second megalodon or just that 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.550
 collar acts 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.110
 maybe both or ufos the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.520
 then come in the megalodon and the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.560
 pull out octopus in a deathmatch 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.180
 throw and we can bet on it 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.710
 to get our premium back in 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.030
 if you have any information about it write it 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.220
 but below in the comments purely 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.780
 and you can of course also on the cc 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.910
 server on the go if he of course 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.590
 premium has that again and again on the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.950
 point but if you do it look 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.970
 over 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.800
 Maybe you find the one or 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.940
 another tip and of course you can 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.370
 I'm back from vacation 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.990
 find out what it is me of course 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.280
 present the video please 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.130
 and informed then let the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.900
 thumb down licon sky makes sharing 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.880
 sexy and subscribe is required 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.880
 this sense bator goal in the eye
