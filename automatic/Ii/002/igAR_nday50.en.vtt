 the net profit of 7,700 to breathe the breath 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.050

 eye does not work 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.000
 with the lesson learned it was time to jump into the water 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.290
 and here began the underwater adventure 112 andalusia we did not come across tiers 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.040

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.320

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.710
 the activity of blue and with the whole family 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.200

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.730
 imagining and looking for prominence 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.570

 but nothing that there was no way to find the person and his son 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.949
