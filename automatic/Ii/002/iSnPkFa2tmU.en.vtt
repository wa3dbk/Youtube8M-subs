really thinking of using a stick that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.539 
really thinking of using a stick that
was<00:01:05.100> puzzle<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.840> my<00:01:06.840> main<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.409> Nationals<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
was puzzle as my main at Nationals so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.880 
was puzzle as my main at Nationals so
let's<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:10.500> colors

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
let's take a look and see which colors

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.850 
let's take a look and see which colors
we<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.369> use<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.140> plan<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
we want to use so I think my plan is to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
we want to use so I think my plan is to
take<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.900> bright<00:01:15.900> green<00:01:16.220> yellow<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.759> orange

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
take the bright green yellow and orange

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.880 
take the bright green yellow and orange
and<00:01:19.430> replace<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.840> here<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.770> be

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and replace them here so this will be

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
and replace them here so this will be
some<00:01:23.310> type<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.729> half<00:01:23.909> bright<00:01:24.210> stickerless

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
some type of a half bright stickerless

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.170 
some type of a half bright stickerless
cube<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> excited<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.150> that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
cube and I'm kind of excited to see that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490 
cube and I'm kind of excited to see that
so<00:01:27.540> I'm<00:01:27.630> gonna<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.960> ahead<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.170> do<00:01:28.320> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
alright so that was actually more work

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.600 
alright so that was actually more work
than<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.930> thought<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.950> plans

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
up with ok so from all of that this is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
what I get

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.020 
what I get
so<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.810> switched<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.030> orange

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so I actually switched out the orange

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
so I actually switched out the orange
green<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.329> blue<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> bright<00:01:46.619> orange

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

green and blue as you can see there and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
green and blue as you can see there and
then<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:50.700> wasn't<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.119> happy<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.479> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
then I still wasn't really happy with it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
then I still wasn't really happy with it
it<00:01:51.869> looked<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.439> too<00:01:52.680> bright<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it looked like a little too bright so I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.840 
it looked like a little too bright so I

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
this my idea for this came from a post

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.490 
this my idea for this came from a post
on<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:17.580> Facebook<00:02:18.060> cubing<00:02:18.420> group<00:02:18.630> by<00:02:18.870> my<00:02:19.200> friend

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
on a Facebook cubing group by my friend

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.980 
on a Facebook cubing group by my friend
kik<00:02:19.800> Clemente<00:02:20.190> he<00:02:20.730> made<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:21.510> his<00:02:21.750> color

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
kik Clemente he made one but his color

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.870 
kik Clemente he made one but his color
scheme<00:02:22.230> was<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> little<00:02:22.680> different<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.700> he

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
scheme was a little different I think he

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.570 
scheme was a little different I think he
had<00:02:24.120> black<00:02:24.480> opposite<00:02:25.080> blue<00:02:25.380> but<00:02:26.130> yeah<00:02:26.340> that's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
had black opposite blue but yeah that's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.950 
had black opposite blue but yeah that's
pretty<00:02:26.730> cool<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.270> thought<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.540> was<00:02:27.690> fun

like doing little experiments like this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.930 
like doing little experiments like this
I<00:02:39.780> still<00:02:40.350> might<00:02:40.560> switch<00:02:40.860> out<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.250> yellow<00:02:41.520> for

white<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:43.050> completely<00:02:43.440> sure<00:02:43.620> I

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
white but I'm not completely sure I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.100
