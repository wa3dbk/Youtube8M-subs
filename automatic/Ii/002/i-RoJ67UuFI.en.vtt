00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
doing a flex test under my massive 85

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.120 
doing a flex test under my massive 85
pounds<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.820> board<00:03:19.150> has<00:03:19.710> pretty<00:03:20.710> much<00:03:20.890> no

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
pounds this board has pretty much no

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.940 
pounds this board has pretty much no
notice<00:03:21.550> woof<00:03:21.760> works<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.330> writer<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.950> it

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
notice woof works to the writer and it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.440 
notice woof works to the writer and it
might<00:03:24.070> look<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.520> has<00:03:24.670> flex<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.300> that's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
might look like it has flex but that's

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.030 
might look like it has flex but that's
just<00:03:25.540> cuz<00:03:25.750> I'd<00:03:25.900> bad<00:03:26.110> balance<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.710> jump<00:03:26.950> on

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
just cuz I'd bad balance and I jump on

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.290 
just cuz I'd bad balance and I jump on
the<00:03:27.190> edges<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.690> yeah<00:03:29.140> i'll<00:03:30.130> just<00:03:30.610> go<00:03:31.060> here

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
the edges so yeah i'll just go here

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:53.140 
the edges so yeah i'll just go here
to<00:03:31.570> prove<00:03:31.810> my<00:03:32.080> point

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.570 

okay<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:55.420> see<00:03:56.420> their<00:03:56.659> head

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
okay so see their head

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.210 
okay so see their head
very<00:04:00.270> little<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.750> no<00:04:00.900> flex<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:03.030> yet<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:05.040> my

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
very little to no flex and yet in my

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.530 
very little to no flex and yet in my
look<00:04:05.370> what<00:04:05.490> he<00:04:05.580> has<00:04:05.610> flex<00:04:06.000> because<00:04:06.240> it's<00:04:06.420> an

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
look what he has flex because it's an

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.320 
look what he has flex because it's an
optical<00:04:06.900> illusion<00:04:07.580> because<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.610> jump<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
optical illusion because I jump on the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.930 
optical illusion because I jump on the
edges<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:11.190> makes<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.490> look<00:04:11.580> like<00:04:11.730> ants

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
edges in it makes you look like ants

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.800
