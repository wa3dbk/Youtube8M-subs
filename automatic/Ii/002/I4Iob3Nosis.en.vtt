pastels<00:01:38.730> so<00:01:39.420> India<00:01:40.380> ink<00:01:40.650> doesn't<00:01:41.580> seep

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
pastels so India ink doesn't seep

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.680 
pastels so India ink doesn't seep
through<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.770> network<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.760> then<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.210> take

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
through to the network and then we take

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.400 
through to the network and then we take
