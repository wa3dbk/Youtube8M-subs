 that's what sport is about 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.270
 Table tennis how is that after ten 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 years 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.260
 icebreaker if you are so now if you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 looks back now 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.079
 you also have one or the other 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.789
 had members change you can 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.809
 do not talk and pose at the same time 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.750
 although I can not even play 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.030
 dealt at the same time 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 that was actually a point for 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 You ask me the question I ask 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 Actually, nothing is heard 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 now your personal dream lineup 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.939
 the world was at the present time 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 the very soon after he heard no one 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.000
 Of course, it's not life 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.159
 full of deprivations because of children there 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.890
 outside, think carefully 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.200
 exactly whether's asleep in school or whether you 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 join in and think carefully about whether 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.549
 you go to june or not and think 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.350
 you really want to become rockstar 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.530
 or tv star because when he's lonely 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.060
 Wanting to be natural wealth floats 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.470
 have the thickest sled and loud 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.450
 the girls behind her in her but 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 do not have the time to doctor 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 then rockstar or is it in 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.850
 Watching TV but that's not the way it is 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.469
 not like you in the gala 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.880
 are you lonely alex yes yes yes tell it 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.280
 was the plaut are not at all 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.649
 explain it comes to a jubilee tour 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.319
 ten years icebreaker eleven shot 12,000 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.640
 miles or something I've heard that yes 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.120
 I think that's the same thing on the poster 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.870
 the poster already read 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.549
 No I researched tough 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.650
 to tell our closer 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.560
 the most important info is it will be one 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.030
 travel through eleven cities will be about 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.310
 12,000 miles on this journey 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.280
 put back and what stood on the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.180
 poster ten years right and I think 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.670
 that's the most important 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.940
 hey damn, now there are the two 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.299
 also again ten years malefiz good 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.620
 held 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.590
 Markus Schleuter I know you now 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.660
 Also almost grateful for 20 years 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.200
 he was yes there already has the first one 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:59.019
 tied my career back then 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.670
 written down that st na well that has 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.340
 The story was clarified after I met him 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.170
 have been looking home at night ever since 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.569
 the icebreaker thinks well he tells me 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.150
 also says trouble because he is still afraid 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.980
 from time to time has violence but one 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.000
 solution to the call also very often on and 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.069
 we do not want to meet anymore 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.989
 Become a bit icebreaker 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.329
 it is indeed so absolutely question 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.380
 I wonder why he is not his child 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.380
 has named song of ours 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.819
 so 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.620
 we hope that next album the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.819
 2014 , this will be this 1 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.920
 reached but we see the sporty 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.079
 was not bitten but it sporty 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.489
 once you drive in formula-1-race-never with 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.530
 to be under last because only if you 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.209
 have a little something on it too 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.400
 others like to deal with you 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.930
 athletic, sexual or musical 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.680
 stay first with athletic always 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.540
 know so long when you stop 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.169
 to impress yourself or too 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.519
 it was really a year too 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.540
 what you do yourself when you do that 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.120
 no longer succeed then you need 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.439
 do not expect that provide other optional 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.909
 may need music that I so emotional 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.650
 touch that you yourself were 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.009
 century percent yes and that is 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.070
 in fact, they are often very cheesy 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.239
 crates so I have to say 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.650
 So in the closet is really 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.419
 everything from abba to zappa is there too 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.060
 pokémon plate as it came in 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.560
 because they are not exactly rumored 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.400
 I would have to talk to something 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.699
 but had electro baltic dani doran 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.099

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.800
 Do you have more for children's television? 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.270
 The pigs did a great deal for that 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.770
 made anime boxes and I was 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.030
 young I also needed money and me 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.620
 was allowed to somehow times such a 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.199
 deep voice somewhere or yes so who 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.900
 konrad something clichéd bald 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.220
 The rapper has to have a deep voice earlier 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.020
 the school is're also great 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.389
 basketball player swimmer basketball 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.690
 eight minutes later it was out of the 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.150
 Team thrown with scorn and shame 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.440
 chased 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.650
 I find trips that now quite well 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.630
 there is a digitals pass box 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.370
 I heard out with two songs 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.630
 which he has recorded again 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.370
 on the occasion of a tour 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.919
 why the two are and which are 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.900
 icebreaker is the eponymous song 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.509
 our band was called the first plate 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.789
 icebreaker debut album icebreaker 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.919
 icebreaker and as a title on it 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.270
 is called icebreaker as that must have been in 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.940
 which I also looked very funny 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.220
 to have 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.900
 when we started in 2003 there had 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.790
 We do not have the possibilities 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.070
 to do so as we do today we do it 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.780
 looking back after ten years are 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.730
 incredibly important song he wears 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.850
 actually the attitude of the band he is 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.410
 the eponymous patron or pixar the again 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.480
 completely reissued and the thing 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.700
 bangs in a fashion ins 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.410
 Arrangement a bit modernized 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.320
 made fit for the club and he bangs 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.920
 simply that means we have an old one 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.330
 beautifully restored classic and me 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.470
 believe that is ready to go again 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.470
 I'm very upset with clubs 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.230
 confident and the adrenaline remix is 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.300
 also a real board so pixel with the 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.300
