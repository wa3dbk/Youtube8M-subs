violin<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.380> piano<00:00:13.460> I'm<00:00:14.460> sure<00:00:14.670> you're<00:00:14.820> familiar

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
violin or piano I'm sure you're familiar

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.980 
violin or piano I'm sure you're familiar
with<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.599> kind<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.109> idea<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> grading<00:00:17.100> system

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
with the kind of idea of grading system

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.170 
with the kind of idea of grading system
so<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.320> example<00:00:19.710> grade<00:00:20.010> won't<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.880> fairly

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
so for example grade won't be fairly

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.820 
so for example grade won't be fairly
basic<00:00:21.510> stuff<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.470> move<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.800> to

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
basic stuff and then as you move up to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.740 
basic stuff and then as you move up to
grade<00:00:23.250> eight<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.699> start<00:00:24.029> approaching<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.480> kind

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
grade eight you start approaching a kind

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.800 
grade eight you start approaching a kind
of<00:00:24.810> professional<00:00:25.439> standard<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.949> play<00:00:26.810> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
of professional standard of play and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.480 
of professional standard of play and
then<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.470> go<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.340> other

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
then you can go on and you can do other

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.049 
then you can go on and you can do other

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
when I studied for my teachers exam I

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.200 
when I studied for my teachers exam I
needed<00:06:50.440> a<00:06:50.530> few<00:06:50.740> extra<00:06:51.010> books<00:06:51.610> as<00:06:51.760> well<00:06:51.910> they

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
needed a few extra books as well they

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.510 
needed a few extra books as well they

the<00:06:54.610> exams<00:06:54.910> themselves<00:06:55.090> costs<00:06:55.960> money<00:06:56.220> so<00:06:57.220> I

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
the exams themselves costs money so I

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.710 
the exams themselves costs money so I
hope<00:06:58.120> that's<00:06:58.270> an<00:06:58.420> informative<00:06:58.780> breakdown<00:06:59.290> and

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
hope that's an informative breakdown and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.650
