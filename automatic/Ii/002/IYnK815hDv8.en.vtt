00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.520
 how about ready for the return to school 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.520
 I'm going to show you how the bows will be 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.080
 this is the material that we are going to occupy 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.660
 two types of slats these are in 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.029
 combination in coffee and green and these the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.189
 let's use in the little blue mascot 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.980
 mascotitas that is of the one of squares 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.859
 We are also going to use thread and needle to 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.259
 sew aluminum wire pins for 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.690
 go stopping let's use some combs 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.430
 and we are going to use some headbands also a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.680
 little cold silicone and a little 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.280
 hot silicone here we have a ribbon 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.650
 that measures 50 centimeters you put it on 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.510
 size you like it and nothing else 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.630
 only thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.600
 find it here you leave some of the 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.030
 points out and remember you have 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.760
 that always fold in half so that 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.270
 be well proportioned because if not a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.580
 ear 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.089
 it can be smaller than the other and 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 as we always put the wire and 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.490
 we squeeze do not squeeze too much because it 's 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.890
 the scope can be broken but we are going to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.650
 put the brown ribbon that the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.460
 combination and what I recommend is 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.830
 that you do it the color of the uniform of 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.140
 your girls school can see father 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.140
 that if you do not do them according to the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.110
 like shapes books like the color of 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.090
 the backpack and you can also do them 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.850
 to sell because many times not all 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.310
 moms do not even have time because 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.470
 it brings the same work a lot but 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.430
 they want their girls to bring the bows 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.550
 cute then you can still sell them 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.100
 out at school with your friends the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.470
 moms of friends and so on ok 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.759
 here you noticed we were wiring 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.430
 one by one and we're going to close it with this 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.110
 so that the wire is not visible 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.690
 let's cut the wire that after 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.630
 wire cut it with use scissors 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.000
 rough so you do not treat your scissors 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.190
 fabric and now there's nothing else 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.280
 detail why because if you look here you 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.110
 we leave the legs without cutting all the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.730
 We made these pickets for this side 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 then we are going to cut it also from 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.630
 little bit on this side I already cause it here 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.390
 and with thread and needle if you can see it is 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 already perfectly cooked or in this 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.620
 moment we are going to stick with silicone 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.470
 hot so you can see what it is 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.800
 it's also super easy, the silicone you're going 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.610
 to hit from this side 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.610
 we already have one cooked and the other stuck 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.790
 Now let's make a double bow with the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.370
 blue mascotite double as in flower that 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.520
 see very very cute then look here 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.070
 we have the mascot in navy blue here 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.900
 if we are going to make it from a tie you fix 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.270
 here the leg is very long but not 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 matter now we already detailed it already 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.750
 when you are going to do it to do 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.970
 business and if you have to be more careful 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.800
 with the material but right now I'm 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.640
 itself 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.950
 then we make two big ties and the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.950
 let's find here let's cut 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.020
 cut now let's make another two 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.020
 just a little more guys 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.280
 this if you notice is a little more 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.680
 great you verify that they are the same and 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.459
 now let's make another two more 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.700
 we are 24 and we are two more 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.700
 plus 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.840
 Moreover chiquitos 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.850
 couples are the same and now we are going to 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.740
 we are going to make them as a flower of 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.310
 strips of agreement one we put it 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.900
 vertical 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.819
 horizontal then let's put one 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.890
 inclined not equal so that it does not 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.620
 find 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.830
 and equal chiquitos 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.319
 and so and now yes yes we already like how it 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.859
 see then all 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.920
 are six years that form a flower and the 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.380
 you can put in a brooch in this case 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.930
 we're going to ride in a diadem the 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.360

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.689
