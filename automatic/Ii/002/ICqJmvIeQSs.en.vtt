00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
so going to this third game I think mvd

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.210 
so going to this third game I think mvd
will<00:03:51.870> stick<00:03:52.140> with<00:03:52.170> Diddy<00:03:52.500> Kong<00:03:52.710> but<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.130> he

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
will stick with Diddy Kong but if he

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.500 
will stick with Diddy Kong but if he
doesn't<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.610> would<00:03:53.700> probably<00:03:53.880> be<00:03:54.060> duck<00:03:54.240> hunt

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
