giving<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.210> short<00:04:07.540> amount<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:07.840> time<00:04:07.900> to

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
giving you a short amount of time to

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.650 
giving you a short amount of time to
reorient<00:04:08.590> yourself<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:10.060> sometimes<00:04:10.480> the

reorient yourself but sometimes the
changes<00:04:11.020> occur<00:04:11.290> even<00:04:11.470> faster<00:04:12.100> as<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.820> next

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.240 
changes occur even faster as in the next
two<00:04:13.210> examples<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:14.500> which<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.920> tonality

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
two examples in which the tonality

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.000 
two examples in which the tonality
changes<00:04:15.790> twice<00:04:16.060> per<00:04:16.330> measure<00:04:16.830> there<00:04:17.830> are<00:04:17.950> a

changes twice per measure there are a

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.590 
changes twice per measure there are a
couple<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.370> approaches<00:04:18.550> to<00:04:18.940> navigating<00:04:19.420> these

quick progressions one is to concentrate

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.420 
quick progressions one is to concentrate
on<00:04:21.610> common<00:04:22.090> tones<00:04:22.270> as<00:04:22.570> an<00:04:22.900> example<00:04:23.230> 6<00:04:23.620> which

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
on common tones as an example 6 which

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.490 
on common tones as an example 6 which
