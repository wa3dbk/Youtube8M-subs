the<00:03:43.660> valley<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.200> first<00:03:44.500> thing<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.770> realized<00:03:45.190> is

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
the valley and first thing I realized is

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.979 
the valley and first thing I realized is
the<00:03:45.550> gunship<00:03:45.970> right<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.540> top<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:46.959> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
the gunship right on the top at the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.410 
the gunship right on the top at the
first<00:03:47.680> frame<00:03:47.950> meaning<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.640> there<00:03:48.940> will<00:03:49.180> be<00:03:49.390> a

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
first frame meaning that there will be a

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.560 
first frame meaning that there will be a
gunship<00:03:49.959> on<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.470> Valley<00:03:50.709> then<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.730> quad<00:03:52.540> bike

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
gunship on that Valley then a quad bike

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.960 
gunship on that Valley then a quad bike
passes<00:03:53.470> through<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.860> screen<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.370> let<00:03:54.820> me

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
passes through the screen and let me

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.970 
passes through the screen and let me
tell<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.360> what<00:03:55.600> this<00:03:55.840> quad<00:03:56.260> looks<00:03:56.560> great

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
tell you what this quad looks great

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.220 
tell you what this quad looks great
something<00:03:57.820> else<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.090> take<00:03:58.270> note<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
something else to take note of is that

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.080 
something else to take note of is that
they<00:03:59.500> seem<00:03:59.860> like<00:04:00.070> they<00:04:00.310> are<00:04:00.489> hiding<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
they seem like they are hiding the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.540 
they seem like they are hiding the
possibility<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.989> us<00:04:02.380> noticing<00:04:02.920> you've<00:04:03.190> any

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
possibility of us noticing you've any

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.150 
possibility of us noticing you've any
new<00:04:03.820> things<00:04:04.120> via<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.720> kill<00:04:04.989> feed<00:04:05.230> therefore

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
new things via the kill feed therefore

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160 
new things via the kill feed therefore
they<00:04:06.370> might<00:04:06.610> be<00:04:06.790> hiding<00:04:07.030> something<00:04:07.690> but<00:04:08.110> I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
they might be hiding something but I

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.960 
they might be hiding something but I
really<00:04:08.680> doubt<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.340> probably<00:04:09.580> just

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
really doubt so it's probably just

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.270 
really doubt so it's probably just
because<00:04:10.090> they<00:04:10.870> noticed<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:11.739> better<00:04:12.040> if

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
because they noticed that it's better if

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.910 
because they noticed that it's better if
they<00:04:12.459> don't<00:04:13.150> release<00:04:13.540> any<00:04:13.840> trailers<00:04:14.290> with<00:04:14.680> the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
they don't release any trailers with the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.130 
they don't release any trailers with the
killfeed<00:04:15.370> just<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.209> we<00:04:16.419> don't<00:04:16.450> notice<00:04:17.109> things

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
killfeed just so we don't notice things

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.810 
killfeed just so we don't notice things
that<00:04:17.680> they<00:04:17.799> don't<00:04:17.979> want<00:04:18.280> us<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.460> notice

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.180 

next<00:04:22.820> clip<00:04:23.180> is<00:04:23.389> showing<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.169> same<00:04:24.440> map<00:04:24.740> but<00:04:25.040> we

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
next clip is showing the same map but we

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.030 
next clip is showing the same map but we
have<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.490> view<00:04:25.910> from<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.210> quad<00:04:26.540> bike<00:04:26.750> we<00:04:27.440> do<00:04:27.710> get

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
have a view from the quad bike we do get

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.370 
have a view from the quad bike we do get
a<00:04:28.070> bigger<00:04:28.370> view<00:04:28.639> of<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.880> map<00:04:29.090> itself<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.260> it

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
a bigger view of the map itself and it

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.560 
a bigger view of the map itself and it
lets<00:04:30.590> us<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.070> dog<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.669> map<00:04:31.880> will<00:04:32.120> be<00:04:32.150> set

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
lets us the dog that the map will be set

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.650 
lets us the dog that the map will be set
in<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.810> mountain<00:04:33.260> terrain<00:04:33.790> other<00:04:34.790> than<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.389> we

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
in a mountain terrain other than that we

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.260 
in a mountain terrain other than that we
can<00:04:35.810> notice<00:04:36.200> at<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.530> Angostura<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.580> quad<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.240> a

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
can notice at the Angostura a quad and a

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.110 
can notice at the Angostura a quad and a

mobile artillery park by the road firing

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.110 
mobile artillery park by the road firing
rockets<00:04:41.570> toward<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.020> enemy<00:04:42.639> we<00:04:43.639> then<00:04:43.850> get<00:04:44.060> a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
rockets toward the enemy we then get a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.180 
rockets toward the enemy we then get a
view<00:04:44.419> from<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.870> mobile<00:04:45.080> artillery<00:04:45.620> as<00:04:45.980> its

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
view from the mobile artillery as its

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.330 
view from the mobile artillery as its
virus<00:04:46.550> Rockets<00:04:47.030> around<00:04:47.389> there<00:04:48.139> so<00:04:48.650> we<00:04:49.010> get<00:04:49.310> a

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
with a crane topping it this does look

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.280 
with a crane topping it this does look
very<00:04:54.080> like<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.850> ones<00:04:56.330> we<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.780> find<00:04:57.110> in

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
very like to the ones we can find in

little burn in the phone scene we see

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.140 
little burn in the phone scene we see
this<00:05:03.560> fruit<00:05:03.830> as<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.190> charging<00:05:04.729> right<00:05:05.120> into

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
looks like an atgm launcher we can also

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.060 
looks like an atgm launcher we can also
know<00:05:11.060> that<00:05:11.090> he<00:05:11.510> has<00:05:11.630> reactive<00:05:12.320> armor<00:05:12.710> on<00:05:12.919> the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
know that he has reactive armor on the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.490 
know that he has reactive armor on the
front<00:05:13.400> making<00:05:13.550> this<00:05:13.880> vehicle<00:05:14.300> heavy<00:05:14.600> armored

compared<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.250> other<00:05:16.520> tanks<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.479> hunt<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:17.810> also

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
compared to other tanks the hunt is also

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.000 
compared to other tanks the hunt is also
quite<00:05:18.380> similar<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.220> t90<00:05:20.500> we<00:05:21.500> then<00:05:21.740> get<00:05:21.950> to

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
quite similar to the t90 we then get to

quite similar to the t90 we then get to

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
mountain I think we have already seen

that<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:26.810> right<00:05:27.380> after<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.950> we<00:05:28.430> get<00:05:28.669> some

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
that and right after that we get some

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.270 
that and right after that we get some
new<00:05:29.180> gameplay<00:05:29.660> from<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:30.080> tank<00:05:30.350> superiority
