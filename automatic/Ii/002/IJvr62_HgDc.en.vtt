00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.700 
camera slowly what whilst having the
button<00:03:06.280> down<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.690> takes<00:03:08.020> multiple

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
button down and it takes multiple

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.410 
button down and it takes multiple
pictures<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.520> combines<00:03:09.700> them<00:03:10.090> into<00:03:10.240> one

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
pictures and it combines them into one

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.860 
pictures and it combines them into one
picture<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.800> one<00:03:12.040> picture<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
picture and that one picture is a

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.800 
picture and that one picture is a
panoramic<00:03:14.410> photo<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:16.000> combines<00:03:16.420> them

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
panoramic photo and it combines them

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.370 
panoramic photo and it combines them
very<00:03:17.320> well<00:03:17.470> if<00:03:18.460> let's<00:03:18.880> say<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.570> do<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> 360

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
very well if let's say you do a 360

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.820 
very well if let's say you do a 360
degree<00:03:20.650> turn<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:22.480> go<00:03:22.840> over<00:03:22.990> let's<00:03:23.500> say<00:03:23.680> do

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
degree turn and you go over let's say do

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.090 
degree turn and you go over let's say do
370<00:03:24.790> degrees<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.320> realizes<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.040> and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
370 degrees it now it realizes this and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.949 
370 degrees it now it realizes this and
removes<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.760> extra<00:03:28.150> 10<00:03:28.330> degrees<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.900> you

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
removes that extra 10 degrees that you

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.699 
removes that extra 10 degrees that you
did<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:29.890> only<00:03:30.100> has<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.910> bit<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.300> want

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
did so it only has the bit that you want

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.460 
did so it only has the bit that you want
that's<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.950> really<00:03:33.459> cool<00:03:34.110> also<00:03:35.110> as<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.290> mode

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that's a really cool also as a mode

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.750 
that's a really cool also as a mode
called<00:03:35.500> best<00:03:36.130> selection<00:03:36.840> which<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.380> takes

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
called best selection which it takes

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480 
called best selection which it takes
multiple<00:03:39.760> pictures<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:41.290> chooses<00:03:41.860> with<00:03:42.459> a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
multiple pictures and it chooses with a

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.780 
multiple pictures and it chooses with a
very<00:03:42.940> clever<00:03:43.120> formula<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:44.140> best<00:03:44.680> photo<00:03:45.040> out

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
very clever formula the best photo out

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.449 
very clever formula the best photo out
of<00:03:46.090> those<00:03:46.240> pictures<00:03:46.890> that's<00:03:47.890> good<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:48.310> you

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
of those pictures that's good if you

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.730 
of those pictures that's good if you
just<00:03:48.700> want<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.540> get<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> good<00:03:49.840> photo<00:03:50.080> but<00:03:50.560> you

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
just want to get a good photo but you

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.650 
just want to get a good photo but you
can<00:03:50.950> really<00:03:51.010> be<00:03:51.220> bothered<00:03:51.370> choose<00:03:52.360> which

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
can really be bothered choose which

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.370 
can really be bothered choose which
one's<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.110> best<00:03:53.910> then<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:55.120> have<00:03:55.240> manual<00:03:56.110> now

so yeah that's clicking then you have
another<00:04:39.480> mode<00:04:40.080> called<00:04:40.560> HDR<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:42.780> mode<00:04:43.080> it

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
another mode called HDR on this mode it

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.930 
another mode called HDR on this mode it
takes<00:04:43.500> multiple<00:04:43.710> pictures<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.520> combines

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
takes multiple pictures and combines

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.960 
takes multiple pictures and combines
them<00:04:45.060> into<00:04:45.300> one<00:04:45.450> photo<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:46.290> high<00:04:46.890> quality<00:04:46.970> let

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
them into one photo of high quality let

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.560 
them into one photo of high quality let
me<00:04:48.060> shoot<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:49.740> combines<00:04:50.340> all<00:04:50.700> photos<00:04:51.330> they

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
me shoot it combines all photos they

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.700 
me shoot it combines all photos they
just<00:04:51.840> took<00:04:52.640> into<00:04:53.640> one<00:04:53.790> photo<00:04:54.530> here<00:04:56.030> now<00:04:57.710> hmm

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
just took into one photo here now hmm

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.900 
just took into one photo here now hmm
that<00:04:59.520> that<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.180> it's<00:05:00.690> very<00:05:00.750> good<00:05:01.170> it<00:05:01.700> it<00:05:02.700> works

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
that that is it's very good it it works

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.080 
that that is it's very good it it works
really<00:05:03.120> well<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.830> that's<00:05:05.100> useful<00:05:05.430> for<00:05:05.760> taking

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
really well so that's useful for taking

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.990 
really well so that's useful for taking
very<00:05:06.420> high<00:05:06.570> quality<00:05:06.840> pictures<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:08.610> also<00:05:08.760> has<00:05:08.970> a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
very high quality pictures it also has a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.140 
very high quality pictures it also has a
mode<00:05:09.210> called<00:05:09.240> HDR<00:05:10.080> art<00:05:10.580> where<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.730> does<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
mode called HDR art where it does the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.940 
mode called HDR art where it does the
same<00:05:12.390> as<00:05:12.570> HDR<00:05:13.050> takes<00:05:13.380> multiple<00:05:13.560> pictures

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
same as HDR takes multiple pictures

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.400 
same as HDR takes multiple pictures
combines<00:05:14.550> them<00:05:14.670> into<00:05:14.760> one<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.110> also<00:05:16.260> gives

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
combines them into one but it also gives

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.080 
combines them into one but it also gives
it<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.800> little<00:05:16.890> bit<00:05:17.040> touch<00:05:17.190> of<00:05:17.370> art<00:05:17.610> making<00:05:17.880> a

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
it a little bit touch of art making a
