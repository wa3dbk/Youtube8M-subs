00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
Brian yeah if we're talking about

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.980 
Brian yeah if we're talking about
rotating<00:00:27.609> the<00:00:27.789> fingers<00:00:28.180> in<00:00:28.720> a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
rotating the fingers in a

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.470 
rotating the fingers in a
counterclockwise<00:00:29.710> manner<00:00:30.220> we're<00:00:31.150> gonna<00:00:31.240> be

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
counterclockwise manner we're gonna be

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.660 
counterclockwise manner we're gonna be
just<00:00:32.019> sort<00:00:32.169> of<00:00:32.290> tossing<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.010> football<00:00:33.160> up<00:00:33.519> in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
just sort of tossing the football up in

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.490 
just sort of tossing the football up in
the<00:00:33.730> air<00:00:33.879> to<00:00:34.059> ourselves<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.720> letting<00:00:35.350> the

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
the air to ourselves and letting the

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.320 
the air to ourselves and letting the
fingers<00:00:35.860> kind<00:00:36.129> of<00:00:36.220> rotate<00:00:36.549> around<00:00:36.729> the<00:00:37.150> ball

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
fingers kind of rotate around the ball

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.579 
fingers kind of rotate around the ball
where<00:00:37.479> the<00:00:37.570> ball<00:00:37.720> doesn't<00:00:38.019> necessarily<00:00:38.440> move

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
where the ball doesn't necessarily move

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.229 
where the ball doesn't necessarily move
when<00:00:38.710> we're<00:00:38.799> letting<00:00:39.040> our<00:00:39.129> fingers<00:00:39.610> do<00:00:40.120> the

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
when we're letting our fingers do the

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.270 
when we're letting our fingers do the
rotating<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.900> bowling<00:00:41.170> ball<00:00:41.320> so<00:00:41.650> for<00:00:42.250> a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
rotating of the bowling ball so for a

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.939 
rotating of the bowling ball so for a
right-hander<00:00:42.760> rotating<00:00:43.360> counterclockwise

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
right-hander rotating counterclockwise

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.799 
right-hander rotating counterclockwise
they<00:00:44.949> have<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.100> tent<00:00:45.339> you're<00:00:45.820> doing<00:00:46.150> this<00:00:46.540> type

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
they have a tent you're doing this type

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.280 
they have a tent you're doing this type
of<00:00:46.989> emotion<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:49.239> soft<00:00:49.720> ball<00:00:49.930> you'll<00:00:50.170> be

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
of emotion and of a soft ball you'll be

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.859 
of emotion and of a soft ball you'll be
turning<00:00:50.530> like<00:00:50.799> so<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:52.150> drawback<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.750> I

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
turning like so the drawback to that I

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:53.759 
turning like so the drawback to that I
mean<00:00:53.049> that's<00:00:53.199> what<00:00:53.320> they've<00:00:53.440> been<00:00:53.559> teaching

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
mean that's what they've been teaching

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.680 
mean that's what they've been teaching
for<00:00:54.100> years<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.460> years<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:55.030> what<00:00:55.299> happens<00:00:55.600> to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
for years and years is what happens to

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.149 
for years and years is what happens to
the<00:00:55.809> elbow<00:00:56.170> when<00:00:56.350> you're<00:00:56.470> doing<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:56.860> yeah

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
the elbow when you're doing that yeah

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.590 
the elbow when you're doing that yeah
it's<00:00:57.549> a<00:00:57.580> little<00:00:57.820> bit<00:00:57.909> easier<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.330> what<00:00:58.449> you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
it's a little bit easier to what you

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.969 
it's a little bit easier to what you
would<00:00:58.690> call<00:00:58.809> chicken<00:00:59.199> wing<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.500> shot<00:00:59.710> or<00:00:59.949> you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
would call chicken wing the shot or you

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.590 
would call chicken wing the shot or you
know<00:01:00.280> where<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:00.610> want<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.879> help<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.449> just

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
know where you want to help it and just

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.210 
know where you want to help it and just
kind<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.809> get<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:01.989> thumb<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.559> roll<00:01:02.739> over<00:01:02.769> it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
kind of get that thumb to roll over it

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.740 
kind of get that thumb to roll over it
you<00:01:03.460> know<00:01:03.549> it's<00:01:03.699> more<00:01:03.909> of<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.089> old<00:01:04.360> school

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
you know it's more of the old school

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.750 
you know it's more of the old school
type<00:01:05.019> release<00:01:05.379> a<00:01:05.680> lot<00:01:06.189> different<00:01:06.549> than<00:01:06.610> what

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
type release a lot different than what

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.100 
type release a lot different than what
we're<00:01:06.880> seeing<00:01:06.910> from<00:01:07.270> today's<00:01:07.570> modern<00:01:07.960> day

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
we're seeing from today's modern day

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.590 
we're seeing from today's modern day
players<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.550> modern<00:01:09.730> day<00:01:09.910> players<00:01:10.210> what

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
players so the modern day players what

players so the modern day players what
do<00:01:10.660> they<00:01:10.780> do<00:01:10.840> they<00:01:11.080> go<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.230> different<00:01:11.440> direction

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
do they do they go a different direction

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.260 
do they do they go a different direction
don't<00:01:12.130> they<00:01:12.280> yeah<00:01:12.670> they<00:01:12.700> actually<00:01:13.120> go

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
don't they yeah they actually go

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.690 
don't they yeah they actually go
backwards<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.590> speak<00:01:14.860> where<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.610> know

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
backwards so to speak where you know

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.490 
backwards so to speak where you know
actually<00:01:16.120> using<00:01:16.360> their<00:01:16.480> fingers<00:01:16.660> as<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:16.990> gear

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
actually using their fingers as a gear

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.470 
actually using their fingers as a gear
to<00:01:17.950> where<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.310> ball<00:01:18.520> then<00:01:18.790> starts<00:01:19.120> to<00:01:19.180> rotate

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
to where the ball then starts to rotate

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.200 
to where the ball then starts to rotate
down<00:01:19.990> their<00:01:20.320> fingers<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.950> actually<00:01:21.520> comes<00:01:22.000> up

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
down their fingers and actually comes up

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.750 
down their fingers and actually comes up
almost<00:01:22.780> like<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.740> reverse<00:01:24.100> way<00:01:24.400> to<00:01:24.460> where

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
almost like the reverse way to where

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
almost like the reverse way to where
where<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:24.970> fingers<00:01:25.270> aren't<00:01:25.480> actually

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
where the fingers aren't actually

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.750 
where the fingers aren't actually
rotating<00:01:26.200> around<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.860> ball<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.520> ball<00:01:27.730> is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
rotating around the ball the ball is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.910 
rotating around the ball the ball is
rotating<00:01:28.510> down<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.110> finger<00:01:29.410> so<00:01:29.800> they're

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
rotating down the finger so they're

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.590 
rotating down the finger so they're
actually<00:01:30.160> going<00:01:30.340> almost<00:01:30.880> through<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.450> ball

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
actually going almost through the ball

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.510 
actually going almost through the ball
instead<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.350> around<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.710> ball<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.100> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
instead of going around the ball so the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.770 
instead of going around the ball so the
hand<00:01:33.730> gets<00:01:33.909> on<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.120> side<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.480> bowling

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
hand gets on the side of the bowling

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.420 
hand gets on the side of the bowling
ball<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:35.170> there<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.680> as<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.010> starts<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.310> roll

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
ball is there and as it starts to roll

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.370 
ball is there and as it starts to roll
off<00:01:36.700> they<00:01:37.000> will<00:01:37.180> bring<00:01:37.390> their<00:01:37.600> fingers<00:01:38.050> back

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
off they will bring their fingers back

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.710 
off they will bring their fingers back
and<00:01:38.860> almost<00:01:39.250> roll<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.240> actually<00:01:40.540> makes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
and almost roll it it actually makes

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.420 
and almost roll it it actually makes
your<00:01:40.780> elbow<00:01:41.110> roll<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.860> helps<00:01:42.130> her<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.280> better

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
your elbow roll in it helps her a better

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.460 
your elbow roll in it helps her a better
arm<00:01:42.670> swing<00:01:42.909> and<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.659> more<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:43.990> clockwise

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
arm swing and in more of a clockwise

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.649 
arm swing and in more of a clockwise
manner<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.370> I<00:01:45.400> demonstrate<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.510> show

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
manner so I demonstrate the to it show

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.910 
manner so I demonstrate the to it show
me<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.900> two<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.260> could<00:01:47.500> do<00:01:47.620> if<00:01:47.770> they

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
me the two that you could do if they

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.050 
me the two that you could do if they
have<00:01:48.070> show<00:01:48.340> me<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.550> one<00:01:48.729> going

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
have show me the one going

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.870 
have show me the one going
counterclockwise<00:01:49.479> in<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.050> clown<00:01:50.290> college

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
counterclockwise in the clown college

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.070 
counterclockwise in the clown college
yeah<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:52.360> mentioned<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.780> one<00:01:52.900> where

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
yeah so like I mentioned the one where

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.420 
yeah so like I mentioned the one where
we're<00:01:53.170> gonna<00:01:53.229> go<00:01:53.470> counterclockwise<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
we're gonna go counterclockwise the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.740 
we're gonna go counterclockwise the
fingers<00:01:54.729> are<00:01:54.880> actually<00:01:54.970> going<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.330> do<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
fingers are actually going to do all the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.630 
fingers are actually going to do all the
work<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.110> where<00:01:56.260> we're<00:01:56.710> actually<00:01:56.830> rotating

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
work to where we're actually rotating

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.270 
work to where we're actually rotating
the<00:01:57.940> fingers<00:01:58.300> around<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:59.080> football<00:01:59.920> itself

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the fingers around the football itself

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.670 
the fingers around the football itself
and<00:02:01.240> then<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> other<00:02:01.659> one<00:02:01.900> where<00:02:02.260> we<00:02:02.409> let<00:02:02.560> it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
and then the other one where we let it

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.490 
and then the other one where we let it
roll<00:02:03.010> down<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.400> finger<00:02:03.670> tips<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:05.260> hand

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
roll down the finger tips and the hand

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.740 
roll down the finger tips and the hand
stays<00:02:05.830> more<00:02:06.100> straight<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.729> line<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.420> more

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
stays more straight in line and more

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.240 
stays more straight in line and more
through<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.349> football<00:02:08.739> but<00:02:08.920> we're<00:02:09.069> still

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
through the football but we're still

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.400 
through the football but we're still
making<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.759> ball<00:02:09.970> spiral<00:02:10.629> down<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.840> line<00:02:10.959> so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
making that ball spiral down the line so

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.900 
making that ball spiral down the line so
anything<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:11.920> be<00:02:12.010> done<00:02:12.130> with<00:02:12.250> some<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.610> it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
anything can be done with some but it's

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.280 
anything can be done with some but it's
very<00:02:13.030> subtle<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> soft<00:02:14.020> ball<00:02:14.170> you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
very subtle but of a soft ball you

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.420 
very subtle but of a soft ball you
almost<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.680> over<00:02:15.010> exert

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
almost have to over exert

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.819 
almost have to over exert
raise<00:02:15.609> your<00:02:15.790> hand<00:02:16.090> rolling<00:02:16.329> around<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.379> if

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
raise your hand rolling around and if

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.830 
raise your hand rolling around and if
you<00:02:17.920> want<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.129> come<00:02:18.310> through<00:02:18.670> you're<00:02:19.540> just

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
you want to come through you're just

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.739 
you want to come through you're just
rolling<00:02:19.989> on<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.379> inside
