00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 but 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:11.420
 and be with us looked garcía for 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.820
 tell us about the anteater our 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.800
 friends have to ask what are we going to 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.539
 talk about the animal with the tallest claws 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.039
 great from all over the planet about the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.039
 also days that is the tiger or the lion 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.289
 let's see 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.880
 there are beings on our planet 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.400
 extraordinary that have evolved 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.040
 to be able to adapt to the needs 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.540
 of their habitat for this they have the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.020
 tools needed to be able 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.780
 survive even when your food is 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.000
 ants and termites as in the case of 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.990
 giant anteater that inhabits the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.600
 open mountain savannas burn jungles or 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.690
 forests and grasslands of South America 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.180
 its appearance is unmistakable its long 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.670
 snout with a small mouth lacks 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.009
 teeth but that does not need it for 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.530
 capture your main food then for 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.869
 it has a cylindrical tongue 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.540
 which can measure up to 60 centimeters 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.360
 long with which it helps to ingest 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.520
 up to 140 ants per minute 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.700
 experts calculate that an anteater 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.759
 giant usually consumes about 30,000 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.710
 Ants a day an adult male can 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.350
 measure up to one meter with 40 centimeters 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.380
 long and can weigh up to 40 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.620
 kilograms while its tail reaches 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.140
 up to 80 centimeters long 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.020
 the tail of the anthills plays a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 important role for their survival 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.220
 because this species has the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.400
 lowest body temperature of all 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.310
 kingdom animal and not to lose heat and 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.040
 keep your energy sleeping up to 15 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.130
 hours covering himself with his furry cabbage 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.500
 although the anteater or tulum like 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.960
 he knows him in South America is not an animal 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.570
 aggressive can cause serious damage 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.430
 with its huge claws that are the most 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.440
 large of all the mammals that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.500
 they inhabit the planet with which they 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.410
 defends from its main predators 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.080
 the jaguar and the puma the population of this 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.450
 species has been severely affected 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.180
 for the destruction of their habitat by 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.340
 illegal trade and the excessive house that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.950
 caused the anteater to 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.440
 extinguished almost in Argentina by 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.290
 fortune there is an ambitious program of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.810
 reproduction and reintroduction protection 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.090
 of the giant anteater in the reserve 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.069
 of the iberá in the province of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.560
 Argentine currents 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.139
 with positive results because they have already 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.620
 born several young in his state 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.620
 save us 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.379

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.849

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.010
 animal for this program clear yes 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.599
