 Yes It is a calm channel It is this to introduce today Gamba Rising 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:11.440
 It is a McDonald's limited card Yes This is from the day when the city is equivalent 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.480
 Get and buy the Happy Meal at McDonald's

 But the contents It is a limited card of Gamba Rising I do not know what is contained 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.210
 We decided with two this time 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.550
 By the way all five lines 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:30.140
 Armor Takeshi is two and Baron RyuGen Zangetsu still roots after 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.140
 As there is only this for Ganzurising cards of Zangetsu so far 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.470
 Of course aiming is the face of Zangetsu 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.610

 It is Mitch Kamen Rider Ryugen Grape Arms 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.379
 The films are original, with a matte mark 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 It is amazing thin it's not so much a good texture of the burst Then particulate Arms only card 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.750

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.560
 First is a shame 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:33.700
 It is Kuta and three that Zuntsuki did not appear 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:37.120

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.530
 Another one is good 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.710
 It is a large Emonda 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:02:00.200

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:01.100
 The model is cute This is power on and pulls backwards so that I see 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.310

 This Pokemon battle is something of a star this battle 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.239

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.370
