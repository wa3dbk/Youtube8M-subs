00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 for the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.150
 the uninterrupted energy systems 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.010
 ou ps by its acronym in English 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.209
 they are devices that thanks to their batteries 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.789
 can provide electrical power after a power failure to all 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.650
 devices that you have connected 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.939
 to talk about the subject 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.359
 today we bring the new cows 700 rs manufactured by ate are explained by 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.460
 conversion 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.680
 turn this form the alternating current 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.990
 like the one that arrives in all homes and offices through the company 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.260
 energetic and transforms it to direct current 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.910
 in order to feed the load and store it in its internal battles 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.859
 as a spokesman not very easy ps in the back 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.249
 this ope that 36 collectors 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.079
 where in his famous the teams that we want to protect so much from a blackout 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.440
 as of variations in voltage 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 then in the absence of jihad 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.239
 the ute is backed up automatically 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.249
 the operation of the equipment during a determined period in such a way that 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.379
 let's have enough time to finish a job 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.270
 and then we can save the files 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.980
 and to pay securely the equipment 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.390
 these teams that get into the opds can be from a personal computer with its 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.180
 respective monitor a telephone plate a scanner 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.270
 active network equipment among others 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.250
 the model rs 700 we want here brings a display that tells us the current state 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.830
 of the 'u' ps as for example 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.560
 what is this the current spot market alternates its load capacity the load 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.829
 of internal batteries 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580
 and the input voltage that our studios 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.630
 of recording and every news poet we have in 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.440
 I feel dent and 6 volts 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.149
 this screen also this additional information 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.570
 about the blackouts occurred here tells us 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.700
 we have 2 incidents 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.249
 in which he had a blackout 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.110
 in our house with our hobby 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 we swam tamil autonomy and minutes 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.249
 in this case we have 56 minutes 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.260
 remnants to be able to use 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.310
 the load in volts of connected equipment on our way the percentage 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.710
 load used 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 the output voltage and the output frequency expressed in thirds that saw 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.150
 Sometimes it is the one that is used 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.429
 In colombia 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.779
 for jehle networks 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:21.359
 well now let's do an exercise and reality conditions as it operates once 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.419
 we have here 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.939
 a portable computer to which we have previously extracted your battery this one 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.439
 he did not hesitate we connected to the 'u' ps and this ope goes with eta to a take 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.089
 of electric power coming the court 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.680
 let's play a video 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 disguise we have a blackout as it simulates a power outage then easy 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.420
 we disconnect still present of the power cable and we have the computer 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.669
 continues working under normal conditions 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.439
 that scream that was heard dacca 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.379
 is a is a whistle warning of absence energy is to say that at this moment 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.999
 We are cooperating with matters 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.539
 chievo unfolds 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.339
 we notice that we have an autonomy before 56 minutes 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.999
 that for our case it is more than enough time 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.769
 to finish our tasks save the files and turn off the computer 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.170
 Obviously, the more computers connected to the USSR 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.249
 that autonomy time that will offer will be much smaller 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:15.100
 However 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.070
 let's simulate that the electric current has returned by connecting here 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.070
 again the 'u' ps to take energy 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:25.639
 as we see 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.809
 already the whistle stopped emitting and everything is again in normal 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.010
 the batteries begin again to be recharged after the blackout 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.589
 and that the official who has one weighs like these 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:46.019
 I want to tell you that this model cows rs 700 of apc offers up to 92 minutes of 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:46.729
 autonomy 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:50.839
 has an automatic voltage regulator better known as rich dad 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.549
 incorporates six or more entries 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.459
 three of them for backup with battery and the other three serves for protection 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.119
 against voltage peaks 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:03.069
 offers protection against volcanoes for ethernet and coaxial cable networks 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.519
 as a civil port 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.840
 by which we can count them strong device using software 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.240
 it's inside those personal computers 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.240
 and it has the name of eta pese paul scholes 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.069
 for all of us who have invested 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.619
 in moense computing equipment wireless trotters external hard drives 

00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:22.610
 video game consoles 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.090
 among other peripherals 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.070
 then we have no excuse to let you protect them against the taro eggs and 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.720
 blackouts that not only cause data loss but also costly 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.720
 repairs for electrical damage 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.199
 we pause not before and aol phelps
