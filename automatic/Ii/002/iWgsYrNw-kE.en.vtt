00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.070
 sometimes the dead do not want to leave anymore 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.680
 either because they are tied to a place 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.050
 or because they do not want to abandon a being 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.340
 Dear 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.710

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.090
 called oaks he was a representative 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.329
 doctor and his colleagues at the company 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.300
 they told about a legend the legend of 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.110
 the dentist's house according to what the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.930
 people said in a colony classmedieras 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.540
 of the city was the office of a 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.479
 dentist who lived alone with his 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.479
 mother to enter the home had 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.910
 to cross a fence and according to this legend 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.490
 the medical representatives who came 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.420
 with the dentist were received by a 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.030
 smiling old woman 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.659
 with a frayed dress and shoes 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.280
 bulky she opened the gate to the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.800
 visitors and let them pass 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.620
 the true 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.920
 of the woman 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.950
 he had died 15 years ago but he 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.560
 kept active from beyond the grave to 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.170
 support your child who was the source of your 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.830
 pride and that I had never had for 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.600
 pay an oak secretary he found out about 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.310
 no one had dared to enter 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.560
 the house 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.430
 because seeing the mother walking towards 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.549
 the fence were horrified and fled 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.560
 running they felt that something was not going 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.560
 well with the lady and they did not want 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.050
 expose yourself to some fateful destiny if 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.150
 they accepted the invitation to pass the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.150
 legend was a reason for tablecloths in 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.849
 canteens where oaks departed with their 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.580
 colleagues and got drunk to not feel 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.880
 scared but the matter was 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.580
 troubling for weeks he never 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.459
 I had had paranormal experiences 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.040
 which shocked him because in talks 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.980
 with friends he had to settle for 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.050
 tell anecdotes that happened to others 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.600
 people 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.880
 a day when I had visited several 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.150
 doctors noticed that he was near the 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.340
 famous dentist's house saw the clock and 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 discovered that he had time to visit 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.709
 before your next appointment 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.400
 he went to the nervous home 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.340
 swallowing saw the grate and felt that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.670
 the blood was going to his feet with such 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.319
 not to be like a coward before himself 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.050
 decided to limit itself to checking if the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.800
 famous old woman appeared 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.930
 if he saw her, he would leave immediately 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.390
 but otherwise I would forget the subject 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.460
 forever 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.310
 if the dentist went in person to 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.740
 receive it impatient would a while 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.069
 recommending medication and then 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.590
 I would go 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.959
 and when he arrived he saw that there was no bell 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.379
 but a bell that was operated with 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.379
 a cord 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.870
 nobles played for a few minutes 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.020
 and when he saw that a door opened 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.020
 paled from the shadows emerged a 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.570
 smiling old woman 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.040
 with a frayed dress and shoes 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.170
 bulky 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.709
 oak suddenly noticed that he could not 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.040
 moving terror prevented him from owning 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.099
 of his saints I do not doubt that he starred 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.319
 your first paranormal experience 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.830
 the old woman looked at him sweetly without leaving 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.860
 to smile 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.319
 and without saying a word spoke the grating and 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.370
 moved away so that the advanced visitor 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.530
 oak could finally move some muscles 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.979
 but since I still could not coordinate the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.310
 he let go forward he warned that 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:29.540
 the old woman looked at him out of the corner of her eye 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.120
 later he heard when the fence was 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.169
 closed behind him 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.880
 come through here the doctor expected it was 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.880
 a voice that seemed to come from afar 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.780
 oaks behaving like a robot 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.370
 I advance shaking and sweating the briefcase 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.060
 that he always wore was about to 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.830
 slip from your hand moisture 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.890
 when crossing the threshold of the house what 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.860
 distracted a masculine voice soccer and of 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.990
 owl tree turned to the right and 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.740
 saw a man of medium height a 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.090
 so much coarse sparse hair 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:13.360
 and round face 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.770
 he was wearing a doctor's coat he managed to articulate the 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.919
 another man nodded while he 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.740
 approached with the right hand extended 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.300
 oak shook his hand the doctor lay 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.139
 to laugh while watching the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.520
 medical representative 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.520
 josep are you 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.770
 then oak reacted by noting that 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.449
 had forgotten the movements of the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.400
 old woman 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.510
 I look for her visually behind her 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.620
 and get upset 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.660
 she died years ago she stayed for 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.560
 help me 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.630
 but then 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.210
 the medical representative collapsed 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.060
 when he came to himself I see that he 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.940
 I found somewhere else I saw that I was 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.500
 in a grocery store was 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.990
 lying on a kind of lounge chairs 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.680
 a handful of onlookers watched him half 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.840
 with pity to shout with contempt oak 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.750
 He got up as best he could and with his throat 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.409
 Dry asked where was he 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.419
 they responded 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.699
 saying that they had seen him suddenly 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.849
 in the street at the foot of the house of 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.610
 dentist that they raised him and what 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.499
 they took to the grocery store would not be 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.110
 that a misfortune befalls the 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.259
 weather did not accept a beer 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.150
 cold after drinking it counted the 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.910
 terrifying experience I had had 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:49.170
 someone confirmed that the old woman was 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:51.480
 years dead and another of those present 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.220
 congratulated oaks for having arrived more 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.260
 far away than any other 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.720
 he said it was very brave 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.600
 have entered an abandoned house and 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.810
 known to its occupant a dentist 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.260
 mediocre that he had committed suicide in his 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.139
 office shortly after dying his 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.740
 mother 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.740
 good
