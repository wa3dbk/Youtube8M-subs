00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.220
 boxing of the lg optimus g first of all 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 we thank the friends of global work 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.560
 mobile for this very interesting 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.840
 great c we have for our tests 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.010
 well this package very much 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.350
 elegant 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.129
 we are going to open it and come quickly 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:38.530
 the content here is here we have 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:43.630
 immediately our optimus that I do to you 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.480
 see quickly and in the meantime put a 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:51.579
 moment aside 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:56.040
 here it is we see the content we have 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.930
 a master's and rapid's manuals 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:06.010
 Quick Guide Instructions We Have 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:11.880
 the power supply from an output 2 altar 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 obviously we have the microusb usb cable 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.350
 we have a pair of headphones here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.310
 defined as premium 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.900
 the pon club b then the headphones that 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 they look decidedly well made 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:35.580
 well let's go and put away the package 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:40.210
 let's see our cus g for a moment 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.790
 here it is, you see the terminal is why 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.549
 of you knew it already came out in 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.350
 Korean version and in other markets such as 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.000
 in America for example already in November 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.590
 and here is the version 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.229
 international a 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.659
 characterized by a rear chamber 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.719
 from 13 megapixels 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.549
 we see the size dimensions are of 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:07.990
 131 point 9 mm x 68.9 and the thickness is 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.690
 a thickness of 8.4 mm definitely one 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.959
 very low thickness the weight is of 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.129
 Then weight 135 grams 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.319
 perfectly in line you see the 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.470
 phone sizes are great yes 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.940
 holds comfortably even with one hand 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.069
 you see without too many problems and I have to say 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.110
 which is very much from a feeling of 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.370
 solidity and very very robust 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.650
 the fourth is characterized by the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.019
 presence of that class 2 both for the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.060
 front part for the part 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.940
 rear the rear 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.049
 I don't know if you can see it from 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 video camera but with a dotted pattern 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.250
 quite similar we say to the pattern 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.769
 present on the nexus 4a cat is slightly 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.329
 different we say in this model 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.220
 follows in many aspects the nexus 4 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.819
 but let's go and see some more 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.980
 product feature and we have 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.769
 on the left side the balance wheel of the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:11.680
 volume and the drawer for the micro sim 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.739
 we have the button on the right side 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.389
 ignition found superior we have the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.989
 microphone for noise suppression 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:23.500
 and the jet three and a half is on the side 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.010
 lower we have the micro connector 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.700
 usb that also does from outputs to me hl and the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.910
 microphone for conversation 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.139
 at the front we have the 4.7 display 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.290
 inch a beautiful unit to hd high 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:46.209
 ps plus as it also proceeds from the writing 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.609
 with a resolution of 1280 x 768 at one 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.880
 technology from zero cup that therefore reduces 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.730
 The maximum distance that exists between the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.170
 the panel the glass integrating the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.410
 digitizer inside the panel 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.120
 same man of the sinai 320 points for 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.000
 thumb therefore very high definitely 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.220
 very very high like next we say 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.180
 some of the iphone 126 points per inch 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.880
 and it is very bright because of 577 of 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.150
 brightness obviously gorilla glass tour 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.690
 and possibly we have room 13 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.130
 megapixel with backlit sensor e 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.210
 the flash led 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.440
 the optics and five elements and is a f24 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.730
 then we have the speaker green then 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.440
 the speaker for the speakerphone 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.470
 of course we also have the room from 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.110
 1.3 megapixels and here several sensors 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.270
 also read a notification here 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.480
 hidden in the lower part there are 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.560
 of the soft touch keys back home and the 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.080
 key 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.180
 sorry here it's like you don't see towards 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.540
 appearance phone we have back home and the 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.650
 good menu button let's turn on in the 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.860
 Meanwhile I tell you some more 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.860
 feature 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.050
 the processor is the now well known 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.430
 qualcomm apq8060 can an architecture 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.650
 kite with a 1.5 gb clock a quad core 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.450
 in the 28-nanometer manufacturing process 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.930
 the GPU is just as much now 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:22.570
 well-known wine 320 we have then well 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:26.800
 2 gigabytes of ram and very interesting 32 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.360
 gigabytes of let's say internal memory of 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.970
 that space available as I found 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.160
 meaning should be research 25 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.350
 gigabyte 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.770
 we then told you the blitz of 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.280
 spello you are living right now 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:45.100
 4.7 inch with a resolution of 1200 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.580
 80 x 768 therefore slightly higher 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.790
 compared to we say those who are 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.530
 industry standards that now go 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.530
 around 1280 x 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.590
 then we have the back room from 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.389
 13 megapixel lit room 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:10.699
 1.3 megapixel front 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:15.229
 we have a community h spa from 42 is 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:17.090
 of course it is a h spa so upload 5 76 ma 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.120
 very interesting we elected e 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.919
 then 100 megabits in upload for download 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.120
 and 50 megabits in upload 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.909
 we then have wifi bgne dualband 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.680
 bluetooth 40 with hackett support 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.449
 two of b then the protocol for the 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.759
 music transmission 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:41.419
 we then have the pillow said mhl a 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:45.800
 720p at 60 hertz we have gps in both 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.509
 standard gps version than in glonass e 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.629
 all of which sense rimini accelerometer 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:53.120
 proximity gyro and compass the 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.889
 android version and 4.1.2 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.560
 the interface you see the excellent sui 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.900
 wine towards 3:00 am and the internal battery 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.599
 and at 2100 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.430
 let's see well this is all for 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.900
 what concerns unboxing le 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.729
 technical characteristics of this car 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.099
 I will refer you in the coming days 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.460
 to the various dedicated focuses I will be doing on 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:15.620
 then terminal to the review 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:18.319
 final as usual thanks for 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.710
 following me in a techno greeting 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.710
 lost
