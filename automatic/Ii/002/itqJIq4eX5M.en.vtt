close<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.890> five<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.130> ten<00:02:29.370> witches<00:02:29.880> by<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.360> I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
close to five to ten witches by now I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.170 
close to five to ten witches by now I
mean<00:02:30.870> they're<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.670> everywhere<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
mean they're just everywhere in this

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.290 
mean they're just everywhere in this
level<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.250> they're<00:02:35.250> all<00:02:35.400> wondering<00:02:35.820> which<00:02:36.060> is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
level and they're all wondering which is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.410 
level and they're all wondering which is
so<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.370> which<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.820> your<00:02:38.940> way<00:02:39.060> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
so if a which is in your way it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.040 
so if a which is in your way it's
blocking<00:02:39.660> your<00:02:39.870> path<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.560> wait<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
blocking your path just wait for it to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.290 
blocking your path just wait for it to
walk<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.080> different<00:02:43.350> way<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.890> until<00:02:44.880> that's

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
walk a different way and until that's

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.090 
dies and then his vibe so don't worry
about<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:17.750> we<00:04:18.750> actually<00:04:18.930> this<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.650> really

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
about that we actually this is a really

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.030 
about that we actually this is a really
sloppy<00:04:21.090> job<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:21.840> did<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.410> getting<00:04:22.680> this

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
sloppy job we did of getting this

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.580 
sloppy job we did of getting this
achievement<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:24.600> we<00:04:25.230> thought<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.470> would<00:04:25.530> be

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
achievement but we thought it would be

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.520 
achievement but we thought it would be
good<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.770> post<00:04:26.100> because<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:26.790> just<00:04:27.150> shows<00:04:27.540> you

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
that you don't have to have everybody

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.940 
that you don't have to have everybody
live<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.200> can<00:04:31.230> start<00:04:31.560> all<00:04:31.680> as<00:04:31.770> many

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950

achievement<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:35.270> there's<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.390> few<00:04:36.419> tips<00:04:36.750> for

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
achievement so there's a few tips for

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.100 
achievement so there's a few tips for
you<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.910> now<00:04:38.910> we're<00:04:38.970> just<00:04:39.120> waiting<00:04:39.330> for<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
you and now we're just waiting for the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.060 
you and now we're just waiting for the
elevator<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:41.570> waiting<00:04:42.570> for<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.900> elevator

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
elevator and waiting for the elevator

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.200 
elevator and waiting for the elevator
and<00:04:45.710> I'm<00:04:46.710> going<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.919> throw<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.190> bio<00:04:47.520> bomb<00:04:47.790> and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
and I'm going to throw this bio bomb and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.230 
and I'm going to throw this bio bomb and
see<00:04:48.450> if<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.570> does<00:04:48.870> anything<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:50.240> it's

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
see if that does anything and it's

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.770 
see if that does anything and it's
probably<00:04:51.600> not<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.320> elevators<00:04:52.770> here

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
probably not because the elevators here

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.659 
probably not because the elevators here
so<00:04:54.780> now<00:04:54.930> we're<00:04:55.050> going<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.230> ride<00:04:55.410> down<00:04:55.680> this

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
so now we're going to ride down this

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.430 
so now we're going to ride down this
piece<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:57.030> crap<00:04:57.120> elevator

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.740 

but<00:05:02.190> that's<00:05:02.550> all<00:05:02.790> right<00:05:05.450> we<00:05:06.450> get<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.660> the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
but that's all right we get to the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.870 
but that's all right we get to the
bottom<00:05:06.900> I'm<00:05:07.860> going<00:05:07.980> to<00:05:08.040> take<00:05:08.160> my<00:05:08.340> adrenaline

make to the safe room because all I want

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.200 
make to the safe room because all I want
