00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 I'm just going to show you how it's 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.029
 that we make the collage of several 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.670
 parts is thicker we put all 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.280
 the pieces on top of each other and mac 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 makes a wall to pass glue once 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.690
 only O's here 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.800
 It's already been two of a time and we're going 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 necklace 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.830
 at the time I have pasted only one 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.140
 I'll have to put the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.260
 I asked you what I did not to mark the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 coaches do not mark the tape I got it 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 a piece of cloth here I do not put 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 O magazine so that the plan that player 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.000
 will pass here on tape 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 O peace, when I come here with you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.579
 a cloth is not going to let this one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.670
 wood scratch tape understand then it is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 so we make the collage of people 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 places when there are several pieces of people 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 puts everyone on top of the other brand 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.559
 a risk which will be pasted us 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 make the collage okay 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.059
 Just so, I'll show you around now. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.949
 how do we go about what the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.420
 people put enough cole to be able to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.420
 Stretch bag is there you part of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.640
 down and throw it down to the top 16 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.590
 taffy O here is pulling there in general 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.700
 take care for how much you do not spend too much time to stay 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 brushing here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.790
 The more you pinch the ball more 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.020
 glue then is a brush is used as 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:35.750
 You can see your glue here and come 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.750
 bringing it down there to up 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.810
 e plays with the excess adhesive pulls high 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:58.009
 Here you pick up and down and play. 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.009
 on the collins then the general floor 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.240
 if you do not work with it's good 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.829
 working with excess is only clear to 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.990
 not let this go access to parts 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.580
 pulling you to work with little 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.569
 qualifying ending going-goes 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.049
 piloting and not speeding up is fast 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.049
 passage 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.349
 the excess of the goal is too much 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.410
 there will be left here 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.209
 Where are you going to be? 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.660
 if you do not have more than one 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.550
 the end you will do is take this 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.550
 glue and throw in the can again 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.050
 Ok I'm stretching which then this 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.460
 here are you spend a little qualify 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.090
 brushing now I said she's going 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.090
 ask everything 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.350
 So this one is this way that this 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.110
 is not as time is passing the glue is 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.850
 with several pieces in the brush and I'll show 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.830
 I already taught you how to 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.650
 to finish cut the excess of 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.850
 ribbon with stylet with flour that is 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.440
 with things right 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.330
 another option if you do not have 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.450
 experience is good you do if you 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.980
 take a piece of mdf that his son 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.010
 who did not have much that shouts so the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.010
 blow also broken here is not good that 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.920
 the cut is very mouse you make the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.890
 entered here with this milk 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.270
 Too bad, this leftover tape and get 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.140
 here the massive support supported by working 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.820
 with him here 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.450
 can see that it will cut the same because 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:07.330
 the piece mpf is very sharp making with 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:11.410
 sms that you damage piece is not less 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.989
 and the entrance of the stylus and here 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.989
 supports the piece with amnesia 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.919
 so it's another option of yours 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.700
 finishing 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.229
 in the beginning do not run the risk of doing 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.450
 with mdf 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.090
 I'm going to show you here, it's a 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.340
 piece if it could be four 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.160
 sides and the door but a piece that places 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.229
 one tape here and the other is both sides 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.510
 here at the junction of the tape that I told you to 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.210
 you can not round up when 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.919
 would paste here first if you 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.700
 round does not receive this other tape 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.680
 cool 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:53.890
 now that you are going round not 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:57.640
 to pass here you have to kill the 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.950
 they will take that rounded on a straight 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.650
 liven up the income whenever you have the junction 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.290
 two tapes on and rounded marker 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.410
 good civilian people now this video here 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.600
 continuation of the collage 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.600
 for you to see with a buffered piece 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.760
 here will go in that video talking about 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.580
 This is a championship that 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.460
 was made just ahead and the bottom the ruler 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.710
 other side when the person sees 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.990
 looking like O 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.540
 these two faces will not will not know 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.910
 that on the other side there are these pieces here 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.810
 which are only two feet because it was done 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.690
 like this 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.210
 this would serve two things if 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.790
 go down 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.040
 or if it was down, we'll go 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.200
 look here you will not see will not see 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.540
 this entry here in this case this is 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.970
 a piece that goes to the wall it goes 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.000
 so he is a side 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.560
 here is going to be for the wall is up 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.360
 better to do so is not a question of 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.720
 save the part that has to be done 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.520
 so here is a break from the 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.570
 not a stuffed appliance thing 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.540
 is irregular 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.460
 here is how it will just get this piece 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.930
 and the one on the wall that will stay a space 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.990
 So this is a buffered piece here. 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.190
 that it is so much for base so it is 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.690
 How much for the wall is this good in this? 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.640
 channel so it can continue 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.710
 always bringing novelties of 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.900
 custom furniture for you and start 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.440
 record from that June that is very well 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.210
 coming 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.310
 also do not forget and share with 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.940
