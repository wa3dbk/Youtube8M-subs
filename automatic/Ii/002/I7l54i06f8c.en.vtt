00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to have soy food which is an incomplete

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
to have soy food which is an incomplete
protein<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.350> 22<00:00:58.890> amino

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
protein by the way there are 22 amino

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.939 
protein by the way there are 22 amino
acids<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.840> nine<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.379> essential<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
acids of which nine are essential that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
acids of which nine are essential that
means<00:01:02.160> they've<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> come<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:02.879> food<00:01:03.210> well

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
means they've got to come from food well

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.530 
means they've got to come from food well
they<00:01:03.899> don't<00:01:04.080> contain<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> those<00:01:07.280> sorry<00:01:08.540> as

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
they don't contain all of those sorry as

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.490 
they don't contain all of those sorry as
now<00:01:10.470> also<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.920> milk<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> lot<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.500> vegans

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
now also in milk and so a lot of vegans

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.609 
now also in milk and so a lot of vegans
remember<00:01:14.460> veganism<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.360> 21st<00:01:15.990> century<00:01:16.110> deal

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
remember veganism is a 21st century deal

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
remember veganism is a 21st century deal
never<00:01:17.430> existed<00:01:17.850> before<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.420> vegetarianism

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
never existed before then vegetarianism

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
never existed before then vegetarianism
has<00:01:20.130> been<00:01:20.340> around<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.479> longer<00:01:21.540> but

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
has been around for a lot longer but

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.830 
has been around for a lot longer but
there<00:01:22.619> isn't<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.150> indigenous<00:01:24.150> population<00:01:24.780> on

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
there isn't one indigenous population on

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
there isn't one indigenous population on
this<00:01:24.960> planet<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.500> only<00:01:25.650> eats<00:01:25.979> fruit

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
this planet that only eats fruit

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
this planet that only eats fruit
vegetables<00:01:28.009> as<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.130> said<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.759> our

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
vegetables as I said if you look at our

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
vegetables as I said if you look at our
jaw<00:01:30.060> structure<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> take<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> measurement

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
jaw structure and take a measurement

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
jaw structure and take a measurement
from<00:01:31.560> there<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:32.520> anus<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.479> at

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
from there to your anus and you look at

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
from there to your anus and you look at
your<00:01:33.659> internal<00:01:34.079> organs<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.770> teeth<00:01:34.979> and

your internal organs and your teeth and
these<00:01:35.369> structures<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> movement<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
these structures and the movement of the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
these structures and the movement of the
mouth<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.979> mimic<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> frugivores

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
mouth we mimic that of the frugivores

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.990 
mouth we mimic that of the frugivores
which<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.350> Apes<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.490> maybe<00:01:41.700> between

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
which are the Apes and maybe between

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
which are the Apes and maybe between
three<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.390> five<00:01:42.600> percent<00:01:42.960> meat<00:01:44.180> but<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
three and five percent meat but so the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.830 
three and five percent meat but so the
other<00:01:46.170> thing<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.380> find<00:01:46.740> interesting<00:01:46.890> about

it<00:02:13.099> was<00:02:13.220> organic<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.760> another<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.120> animal

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it was organic and another that animal

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.440 
it was organic and another that animal
has<00:02:14.660> been<00:02:14.810> treated<00:02:15.140> fairly<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:16.819> that's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
has been treated fairly but that's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
has been treated fairly but that's
usually<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> reason<00:02:18.050> why<00:02:18.319> lon<00:02:18.470> people<00:02:18.739> become

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
usually a reason why lon people become

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.650 
usually a reason why lon people become
vegetarians<00:02:19.640> because<00:02:19.880> they<00:02:20.150> don't<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
vegetarians because they don't like the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.150 
vegetarians because they don't like the
cruelty<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.200> animals<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.739> think<00:02:21.920> that's<00:02:22.069> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
cruelty to animals and I think that's a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.610 
cruelty to animals and I think that's a
great<00:02:22.280> stance<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.940> have<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.840> dude<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.260> bit<00:02:24.440> more

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
great stance to have but dude a bit more

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.729 
great stance to have but dude a bit more
of<00:02:24.680> your<00:02:24.739> research<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.400> read<00:02:25.640> them<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.360> book<00:02:27.349> by

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.470

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.890 
I think it's leah is it and it's called

strap them soak them in water but we saw

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.539 
strap them soak them in water but we saw

that will not be released they also

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.880 
that will not be released they also
contain<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:15.700> flow<00:03:16.700> toxins<00:03:17.269> now<00:03:17.900> aflatoxins<00:03:18.739> are

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
contain a flow toxins now aflatoxins are

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.120 
contain a flow toxins now aflatoxins are
produced<00:03:19.250> by<00:03:19.489> fungi<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.290> very<00:03:21.290> carcinogenic

and<00:03:22.250> usually<00:03:22.609> there's<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:23.030> bit<00:03:23.180> again

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
and usually there's a little bit again

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.940 
and usually there's a little bit again
on<00:03:23.630> nuts<00:03:24.109> seeds<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.560> grains<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.220> soy<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:27.620> also

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
on nuts seeds and grains and soy it also

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.520 
on nuts seeds and grains and soy it also
contained<00:03:28.510> trypsin<00:03:29.510> inhibitors<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.170> soy

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
contained trypsin inhibitors in soy

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.640 
contained trypsin inhibitors in soy
which<00:03:30.769> interferes<00:03:31.459> with<00:03:31.910> protein<00:03:32.870> digestion

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
which interferes with protein digestion

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.229 
which interferes with protein digestion
and<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:35.120> cause<00:03:35.829> pancreatic<00:03:36.829> disorders

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
and this can cause pancreatic disorders

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.970 
and this can cause pancreatic disorders
