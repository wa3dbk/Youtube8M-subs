00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.009 

so<00:00:08.429> we<00:00:08.550> saw<00:00:08.700> how<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.910> fit<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> face<00:00:09.599> onto<00:00:09.929> our

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
so we saw how to fit the face onto our

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.540 
so we saw how to fit the face onto our
characters<00:00:10.469> how<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> arrange<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
characters how to arrange the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.400 
characters how to arrange the
orientation<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> football<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.349> we

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
orientation in the football but now we

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.020 
orientation in the football but now we
want<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.950> down<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.340> more<00:00:14.519> specific

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
want to get down to more specific

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.900 
want to get down to more specific
details<00:00:15.560> first<00:00:16.560> go<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.220> detailed<00:00:17.640> facial

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
details first go to the detailed facial

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.870 
details first go to the detailed facial
mode<00:00:18.420> located<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> top<00:00:19.590> bar<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.550> have

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
mode located at the top bar now we have

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.700 
mode located at the top bar now we have
more<00:00:21.119> points<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.810> more<00:00:22.020> precise

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
more points to be more precise

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
more points to be more precise
so<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.490> let's<00:00:23.820> zoom<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.119> closer<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
so first let's zoom in closer to the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.060 
so first let's zoom in closer to the
eyes<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.080> take<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> look

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
eyes and take a look

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.880 
eyes and take a look
notice<00:00:26.820> before<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.390> were<00:00:27.539> very<00:00:27.840> close<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.500> we

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
notice before we were very close but we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
notice before we were very close but we
were<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.189> perfect<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.210> let's<00:00:30.390> go<00:00:30.539> ahead<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
were not perfect so let's go ahead and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.240 
were not perfect so let's go ahead and
adjust<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.320> point<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:32.040> fit<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> eyes<00:00:32.520> better

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
adjust the point to fit the eyes better

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.220 
adjust the point to fit the eyes better
one<00:00:35.250> important<00:00:35.730> tip<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.600> placing<00:00:36.899> these

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
one important tip when placing these

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
one important tip when placing these
specific<00:00:37.800> points<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.790> important<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
specific points it's very important to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
specific points it's very important to
keep<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.600> mind<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.930> space<00:00:40.140> between<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.590> eyes

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
keep in mind the space between the eyes

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160 
keep in mind the space between the eyes
and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> control<00:00:41.700> point<00:00:41.940> later<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.989> add

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and the control point later when we add

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.619 
and the control point later when we add
in<00:00:43.379> virtual<00:00:43.770> eyes<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.219> my<00:00:44.399> magic<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.420> these

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
in virtual eyes and my magic if these

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
in virtual eyes and my magic if these
points<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:46.079> too<00:00:46.260> close<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> eyes<00:00:46.890> because

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
points are too close to the eyes because

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
points are too close to the eyes because
the<00:00:47.670> eye<00:00:47.730> magic<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.450> smaller<00:00:48.750> spaces<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the eye magic to have smaller spaces to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380 
the eye magic to have smaller spaces to
apply<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.550> detrimental<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
apply this is not detrimental to your

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
apply this is not detrimental to your
project<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> something<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.739> might<00:00:52.860> want

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
project but is something you might want

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.529 
project but is something you might want
to<00:00:53.129> keep<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.520> mind<00:00:53.699> while<00:00:53.910> placing<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> points

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
to keep in mind while placing the points

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.240 
to keep in mind while placing the points
next<00:00:57.539> take<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> look<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> mouth<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.980> this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
next take a look at the mouth in this

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.959 
next take a look at the mouth in this
example<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> mouth<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.270> closed

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
example the mouth is closed

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.549 
example the mouth is closed
however<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.449> example<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.199> woman's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
however in this example the woman's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.980 
however in this example the woman's
mouth<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.949> open<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> adjust<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
mouth is open so to adjust for this we

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
mouth is open so to adjust for this we
can<00:01:07.170> select<00:01:07.530> open<00:01:07.770> mouth<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.340> have

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
can select open mouth and have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
can select open mouth and have
additional<00:01:09.180> points<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> fit

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
additional points that we can use to fit

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
additional points that we can use to fit
around<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.189> lips<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.450> another<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
around the lips there is another way to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.660 
around the lips there is another way to
adjust<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.500> open<00:01:13.770> lips<00:01:13.920> by<00:01:14.130> forcing<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
adjust for open lips by forcing the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
adjust for open lips by forcing the
mouth<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> close<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.869> demonstrate

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
mouth to close and I will demonstrate

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
mouth to close and I will demonstrate
that<00:01:16.380> technique<00:01:16.740> later<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.520> tutorial

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that technique later in this tutorial

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
that technique later in this tutorial
for<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.439> example<00:01:19.860> notice<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.700> soldier<00:01:21.000> has

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
for this example notice this soldier has

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
for this example notice this soldier has
a<00:01:21.210> hat<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.479> his<00:01:21.780> head<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.680> move<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> full

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a hat on his head we can move the full

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.370 
a hat on his head we can move the full
hair<00:01:23.549> mesh<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.270> compensate<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.930> such<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> large

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hair mesh to compensate for such a large

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
hair mesh to compensate for such a large
hat<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.979> since<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.729> using<00:01:26.850> detailed

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
hat and since we are using detailed

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
hat and since we are using detailed
facial<00:01:27.869> mode<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.040> points<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
facial mode we have more points to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.069 
facial mode we have more points to
accurately<00:01:29.790> encompass<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> hat<00:01:32.600> next<00:01:33.600> let's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
accurately encompass the hat next let's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.679 
accurately encompass the hat next let's
add<00:01:34.229> eyes<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.130> our<00:01:35.250> model<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.119> open<00:01:36.420> the
