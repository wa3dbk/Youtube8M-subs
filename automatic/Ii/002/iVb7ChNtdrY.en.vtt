00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 and then guys from the ex-premier group 6 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 overclock our friend a new room 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.469
 in another video for you there showing 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.929
 performance of our adapter and gpu 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.680
 model is the suspect gdc best found 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.690
 still at bwin.com beauty website 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.119
 connected there as you already know our 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.539
 Font Tectoy cettrans registered 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.970
 here in the line of 5 flight between Rio Negro and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 a red wire because some sources and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.009
 disarmed if it is not used in the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.530
 line of five votes ok then I got it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.879
 I'm here is 3 lattes and 2011 are 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.739
 undermining connect our work and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.550
 provisional connection that was positive in r 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.070
 7 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.289
 is another book with the 7 35 17 and the are 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.559
 two physical cores and two cores 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.260
 regulated around the 24 senses of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.199
 memory beauty 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.020
 Good, I'll pick up a teenager at your location. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.530
 improvised here just for us to talk 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 with the information above 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 we have there is the use of the GPU 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 temperature usage of gpu usage 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.320
 of the pci express status bus is 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 important you can see that it does not 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:30.140
 never in a warehouse is 100% 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:34.409
 memory gpu clock speed 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.770
 that the amount of memory used in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:43.430
 low this happens and finally the load 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.430
 of use in cpu beauty though here 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.890
 the show bears 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 It's good to show you here the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.230
 game setup is running here is a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.300
 quickie just to give us a test 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.230
 It's fast in 1920, so 1080's in. 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.970
 other that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.860
 but the only thing I've ever had is the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.190
 environmental inclusion I hung up because 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.930
 these 2661 people do not have a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.530
 very good performance 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.480
 sometimes under 30 so everything in the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.490
 another only turned off the environmental occlusion 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:37.480
 beauty 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:40.959
 from here you can see that the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.920
 Parliament there expresses that in the case 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:48.280
 is running ax 1 2.0 and never goes there 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.970
 average of 70% 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.060
 so the guys I fought because 2.0 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.310
 disi 3.0 best when it was already better 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.220
 put talking nonsense guy 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.840
 bus x16 2.0 has lots of band to 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.540
 you use in data with whoever says that 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.540
 in the case using x 1 and is loose 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.819
 for a picture problem here a hoax 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:32.530
 of smoke we can live and die memory 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:40.660
 I do not know how I feel. 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:43.140
 level 54 in a car here we go 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.140
 to happen 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.510
 Can not play a good game. I'll play. 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:06.440
 quiet 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:13.100
 actually the badge works legal was that 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:20.150
 I made here right ball in 4550 while now 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:25.520
 was okay that's it paying mico 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.410
 problem can not play infestation o 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 game full of sand that no one else 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.990
 can take a boat and a boat with 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.420
 ideas that will see how long the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.400
 athletic and I love the most caught sometimes 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:45.940
 but it's the internet being is not of the game 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.940
 I 'm not playing it without fear. 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:00.629
 it seems that sometimes even cpu here gives a 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.629
 bottleneck okay but the video card're 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:17.699
 always in 90 and a few percent to 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:22.169
 use of it no longer has tests to 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:26.370
 to do at first the performance is 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.889
 really good time gives you really 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:36.270
 your done a detailed test to see the 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:39.599
 that we are losing and it was a 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.069
 Shit playing up because I did not 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.599
 able to see his side right in the 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.370
 front 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.370
 just to make this king clear 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.580
 send a kiss to me, what you have 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.050
 lying down watching what this guy did 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:04.430
 my laptop finally just had this then 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.909
 sorry on the web then reassemble is 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.909
 quiet 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.620
 Maria Claudia 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:32.330
 with that I'll do nothing else 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:36.979
 Do not do anything for us, it 's just for 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:41.139
 you have a slight impression there than 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.139
 is to be adapted is able to do 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:49.360
 I would like to test with a more 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:57.139
 parrudos understood with 17 really 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:07:03.289
 hardcore right with the physical cores 14 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:06.889
 Good people, this is it. 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:25.310
 the machine configuration here for us 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:30.349
 see the 7 35 17 the bus here to 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:32.509
 you will see x 12 points the beauty 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:35.990
 Tell me guys, do you share the video of that? 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:37.430
 joinha subscribes to the channel that will have 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.610
 a reason to bring enough news 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.439
 For you guys there are questions or 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.339
 suggestions in a commentary that 

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:48.430
 I'll be happy to answer 

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:48.430
 He said that with God, that's good, shaw.
