00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.059 

I<00:00:04.590> think<00:00:05.460> as<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.700> viewer<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:07.410> definitely<00:00:07.859> has

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I think as a viewer it definitely has

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.930 
I think as a viewer it definitely has
changed<00:00:08.510> it's<00:00:09.510> been<00:00:10.100> you<00:00:11.100> know<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.490> crazy<00:00:11.760> is

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
changed it's been you know this crazy is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.339 
changed it's been you know this crazy is
when<00:00:12.180> I<00:00:12.240> graduated<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:12.900> was<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.260> know

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
when I graduated I was like you know

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.140 
when I graduated I was like you know
what<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.679> might<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:13.980> timing<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.460> correctly<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
what I might be timing this correctly I

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.120 
what I might be timing this correctly I
said<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> myself<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.500> said<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.710> might<00:00:16.980> be

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
said that to myself I said I might be

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.070 
said that to myself I said I might be
timing<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.670> correctly<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.540> I<00:00:18.570> think

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
timing this correctly in that I think

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590 
timing this correctly in that I think
Asians<00:00:20.009> will<00:00:20.130> start<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.699> slowly<00:00:20.970> take<00:00:21.240> off<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
Asians will start to slowly take off it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.099 
Asians will start to slowly take off it
all<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> time<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.289> am<00:00:22.680> getting<00:00:23.100> into<00:00:23.490> this

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
all the time that I am getting into this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.400 
all the time that I am getting into this
thank<00:00:25.109> god<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> did<00:00:26.510> it's<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:28.080> slowly

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
thank god it did it's it's slowly

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.320 
thank god it did it's it's slowly
turning<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> much<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.850> a<00:00:29.910> sidekick

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
turning into not so much of a sidekick

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
turning into not so much of a sidekick
role<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.810> people<00:00:31.320> are<00:00:31.439> starting<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.099> them

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
role and people are starting to see them

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.420 
role and people are starting to see them
more<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> forefront<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.379> I<00:00:34.470> think<00:00:34.739> we're

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
more in the forefront and I think we're

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.889 
more in the forefront and I think we're
still<00:00:35.699> slowly<00:00:36.090> starting<00:00:36.449> to<00:00:36.570> prove<00:00:36.780> ourselves

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
still slowly starting to prove ourselves

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
still slowly starting to prove ourselves
as<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.920> performers

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
as as performers

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
as as performers
I<00:00:39.149> remember<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.260> some<00:00:40.469> casting

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
I remember going into some casting

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
I remember going into some casting
offices<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.880> getting<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.480> vibe

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
offices here and I'm getting this vibe

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
offices here and I'm getting this vibe
then<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.440> expecting<00:00:43.890> anything<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.370> me

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
then not expecting anything from me

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
then not expecting anything from me
there's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.120> second<00:00:45.420> I'll<00:00:45.540> always<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.260> what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
there's a second I'll always see what

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
there's a second I'll always see what
you<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.219> when<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.550> found<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you do and then when they found out that

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
you do and then when they found out that
I<00:00:48.390> could<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:50.579> they<00:00:50.700> wanted<00:00:51.030> me

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
I could you know do what they wanted me

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.690 
I could you know do what they wanted me
to<00:00:51.180> they<00:00:51.660> were<00:00:51.719> surprised<00:00:52.200> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.460> think

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
to they were surprised and I don't think

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.420 
to they were surprised and I don't think
that<00:00:53.820> happens<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.329> any<00:00:54.450> other<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.559> race

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that happens for any other you know race

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
that happens for any other you know race
well<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:57.030> maybe<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.539> minorities<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
well maybe maybe other minorities but I

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.119 
well maybe maybe other minorities but I
don't<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.710> happens<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.100> think

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
don't think that really happens I think

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
don't think that really happens I think
that's<00:00:59.460> specific<00:00:59.940> for<00:00:59.989> asian-american<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's specific for asian-american and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
that's specific for asian-american and
especially<00:01:01.559> males<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
especially males they they don't see a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.710 
especially males they they don't see a
lot<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.350> um<00:01:04.800> maybe<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.850> has<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
lot and um maybe it has to do with the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.460 
lot and um maybe it has to do with the
fact<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.259> still<00:01:07.350> very

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
fact that we're still very

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.039 
fact that we're still very
second-generation<00:01:08.600> maybe<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
second-generation maybe it has to do

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.300 
second-generation maybe it has to do
with<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> fact<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.040> our<00:01:11.159> parents

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
with the fact that you know our parents

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.969 
with the fact that you know our parents
still<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:11.760> us<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> doctors<00:01:12.479> lawyers<00:01:12.979> but

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
still want us to be doctors lawyers but

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
still want us to be doctors lawyers but
very<00:01:14.340> much<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.180> hard<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.450> us<00:01:15.510> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
very much so that it's hard for us to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
very much so that it's hard for us to
take<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.799> break<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> goal<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
take that you know break and goal is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.840 
take that you know break and goal is
sincerely<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> try<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.840> actors<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:20.670> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sincerely off and try to be actors but I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
sincerely off and try to be actors but I
hope<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> changes<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.680> know<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
hope that changes because you know I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.399 
hope that changes because you know I
know<00:01:23.310> tons<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> talented<00:01:24.689> asian-americans

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
know tons of talented asian-americans

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.710 
know tons of talented asian-americans
and<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.790> opportunity<00:01:27.450> but

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and they just see the opportunity but

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.499 
and they just see the opportunity but
they<00:01:27.869> also<00:01:28.020> need<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.920> support<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
they also need the support you know and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
they also need the support you know and
I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.770> slowly<00:01:32.009> starting<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> change

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I think that slowly starting to change

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.039 
I think that slowly starting to change
and<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:36.049> everything's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and because of that everything's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.300 
and because of that everything's
starting<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.470> change<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.799> how<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
starting to change in how they look to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
starting to change in how they look to
done<00:01:38.490> okay<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.119> actually<00:01:39.240> put<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.689> Asian

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
done okay we can actually put an Asian

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.620 
done okay we can actually put an Asian
person<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.920> won't<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> know

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
person in here and it won't be you know

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
person in here and it won't be you know
somebody<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.439> can't<00:01:44.340> act<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:46.439> it's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
somebody that can't act and I think it's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.399 
somebody that can't act and I think it's
a<00:01:46.829> lot<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.070> trust<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:49.020> slowly<00:01:49.259> starting

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
