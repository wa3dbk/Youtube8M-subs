00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 In this video I show you as you 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.799
 lose loosely after losing your job 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.969
 For example, you could take one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:17.789
 change and fell the last piece because 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.090
 the end of the fans here on and in that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.760
 case of the chair I decide 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.070
 here with the last stitch off so 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.599
 i aim is just through and then 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 I look at the pieces from the inside or 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.969
 depending on what you have for a job 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.130
 maybe it's a cap 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.719
 Basically, it does not really matter 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.340
 like her if that's easy 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.379
 just because we have the thread in it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.850
 hiding and you just look at it 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 a tight place where that works 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.000
 I 'm going through with the needle now 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.000
 zigzag through the fabric 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.740
 Of course, you can not do it inside 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.600
 does not see later and pay attention to it 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.280
 that you are not too tight if now 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.670
 pulling together looks the whole natural 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 not so nice I'm still one 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:22.910
 a bit further inwards and us 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.400
 secure the thread in with one 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:33.500
 knot I go here now somewhere 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.930
 under a loop underneath now forms 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 a lax here I pull now 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.510
 off until it is almost gone and then go 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.450
 I once with the needle in the lax 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.690
 in and a second time in the lax 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:58.400
 and then turn it on 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:02.149
 Now I can cut the thread and 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.929
 the thread is sewn and hidden and 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.929
 you can not see them anymore
