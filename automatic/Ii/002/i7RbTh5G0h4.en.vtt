the<00:03:06.220> web<00:03:06.400> maybe<00:03:06.910> for<00:03:07.210> an<00:03:07.270> FAQ<00:03:07.900> or<00:03:08.110> something

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
but it would be cool to see an increase

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.300 
but it would be cool to see an increase
of<00:03:10.570> apps<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.990> use<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.830> snap<00:03:12.070> feature

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310
