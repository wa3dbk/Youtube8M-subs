00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:42.170
 gaga became the champion dep 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180
 ae 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.160
 the sealing spectators are welcome 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.030
 but a video actually not any 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.040
 video to car video space program 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.350
 1.0 movie that stupid crap 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 after four years have still heard 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 of chips with things but more than they 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.810
 want to put in the game but this was the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 that they wanted 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 from the beginning what he would do is here in 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.650
 game then this is a short video 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.140
 He left to you some of the things 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.200
 I find it more interesting in this kind of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.150
 milk is so let's go 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.810
 slowly we are in a new model of 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.850
 flight or now in the nearby new joão 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 pretty in the atmosphere 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.280
 right the technical part i do not understand 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 very well be difficult to leave two links 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.580
 Back to the tetris channel 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.650
 he explains just the one exception 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 and will consider just to do only had 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.190
 20 and it is also the business one point and 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.209
 also something and represents a 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.590
 right 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.590
 briefly what I realize this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.220
 normal was dynamic is as follows 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.790
 first 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.870
 things need to be aerodynamic 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.360
 I know it may seem weird. 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 but before they did not need to be 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.040
 aerodynamics simply did not need 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 You could make a flying cube that he 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.930
 performed wonderfully well then the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.470
 People expect to see the evidence and gloomy. 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.019
 have understood that the reform must 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.989
 basically the rocket points high 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.560
 right at the end of the year cause a lot of race 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.360
 he did in fact have something else 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.940
 When are you going to make an entrance? 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.730
 make a softer angle so as not to 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.340
 causes so much heat-generated race 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.049
 if you design too much heat you can 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.010
 want to put a hit child on your 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:02.820
 capsule returning to survive 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.660
 an easier test well and also takes 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.670
 in consideration 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.810
 the turbines that will put your plane 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 because it's now so easy for you to reach 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.180
 extreme speeds within the atmosphere 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.040
 without much effort and your ship can 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.860
 actually start overheating with the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.530
 friction and do just as you are 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.150
 seeing there in the video or just like you have seen 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.920
 the previous video side of mine 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.260
 first impressions so close 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.180
 giving continuity to this history of 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 new model was dynamic now we have 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.400
 get lost if you can build you 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.440
 even a dynamic with your mouse is just 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.270
 want to always place that base and draw 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
 the format of the faith you want 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.710
 this way you protect the parts in 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.840
 followed the rocket and makes it more 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.840
 aerodynamics this peak for example is that 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.060
 I needed right and even cooler is 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.750
 which she explores so beautifully looks 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.610
 only 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.230
 Look what a beautiful poem for your business. 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.230
 synchronized ahb pa 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.990
 anyway now we also have a new 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.480
 mining scheme that you can 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.360
 free planet resources in asteroids 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.070
 to produce fuel 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.140
 as you are 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.239
 Our mission is what you are there for 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.210
 can scan the planet you can see 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.370
 I 'm more pink where they have more 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.940
 minerals for you to actually mine a 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.740
 very interesting mechanics and 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.919
 Asteroids also have ores and this 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.260
 in case I took it to test 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.169
 connect how much ore you had 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.940
 your raster today varies greatly from one 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.880
 asteroid for the other but this movie 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.490
 draws lots of ore but very much 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.669
 ore even I think it is very feasible 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.990
 you use an asteroid now the 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.190
 mobile fuel right of bastard 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.370
 right after that but there are a few 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.530
 changes in the new baby in which you can 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.230
 see this time also means in their 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.730
 ships flowers that save the ship appears 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.640
 he her drawing became much more 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.250
 easy but much more intuitive 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.060
 you see what your ship is not only 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.600
 By the name 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.390
 okay so now we can open 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.880
 a second ship within its 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.740
 tosoft by april on that light month button 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.050
 ie you have a part of you want 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.800
 use anything that a ship just picks up 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.510
 the alley and puts on your new in the nearby 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.240
 beyond what you can perceive the new 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.810
 video we have several new parts, right? 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.190
 for rockets and airplanes more and the legal one is 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.550
 that the cockpits 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.550
 or rather all ordinary sessions 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.170
 parts that allow you to have a position within 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.570
 all are now modeled by 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.650
 inside were still missing in the version 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.690
 previous 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.070
 one that I found particularly 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.250
 interesting this session of 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.780
 passengers are seeing and can fill 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.930
 cable inside 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.020
 the idea of ​​these parts is to give support 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.600
 new space tourism contracts 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.310
 What they did look only I got to 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.130
 make a video time ago at the clinic 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.200
 space tourist of the galactic virgin 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.990
 very well now they have tourism missions 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.370
 spatial and even large bear 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.400
 calls that you have to go through 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.010
 neighborhoods heavenly bodies is not well 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.050
 interesting thrashing was very similar 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.500
 with a plane of this session there 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.870
 passengers and last but not least 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.600
 important the last touch was missing 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.180
 to give them an extra life to the world 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.620
 of curling that are Carlos and girls 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.130
 flutes and girls 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.830
 This is valentina, it 's over, standard woman. 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.780
 now that together with the boss and bob and she 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:49.480
 There is no pilot that pilot milk until 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:52.180
 better than headed the staff, staying for 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.980
 here is a cheap killik video that 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.710
 also shared guardianship that helps 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.990
 and I'll leave it here at the link 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.410
 forum posting today will translate 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.480
 everything cute timbau and full of 1.0 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.180
 if you want to know more and more thoroughly 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.380
 what happened and have these people 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.380
 It's good and until the next
