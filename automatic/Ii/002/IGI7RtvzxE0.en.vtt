00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
here are really really good we like got

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.499 
here are really really good we like got
an<00:01:10.439> angle<00:01:10.740> he<00:01:10.890> does<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.220> crazy<00:01:11.640> corkscrew

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509

graphics<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.720> pretty<00:01:16.350> nice<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.189> find<00:01:17.490> some

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
graphics are pretty nice I do find some

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
graphics are pretty nice I do find some
of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> building<00:01:18.180> structures<00:01:18.600> even<00:01:19.049> though

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
of the building structures even though

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.240 
of the building structures even though
they<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.580> nice<00:01:20.580> reflections<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they have nice reflections in them the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.749 
they have nice reflections in them the
building<00:01:23.729> textures<00:01:24.450> feel<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.759> little

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
building textures feel a little a little

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.149 
building textures feel a little a little
grainy<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.630> comparison<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.500> hopefully

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
grainy by comparison right hopefully

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.410 
grainy by comparison right hopefully
you'll<00:01:29.310> spend<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.670> much<00:01:29.790> time<00:01:29.850> swinging

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you'll spend too much time swinging

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
you'll spend too much time swinging
around<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.930> busting<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.920> bad<00:01:32.100> guys<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
around and busting up bad guys for that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
around and busting up bad guys for that
to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> much<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> an<00:01:33.420> issue<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.840> let's<00:01:34.799> just

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to be much of an issue but let's just

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.969 
to be much of an issue but let's just
dive<00:01:35.340> into<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.880> mission<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.990> what

dive into a mission here and see what

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.560 
dive into a mission here and see what
kind<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> stuff<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.240> into<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:40.009> I

kind of stuff we can get into you here I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.969 
kind of stuff we can get into you here I
found<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.020> gameplay<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.409> really<00:01:43.710> great

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
found the the gameplay is really great

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.490 
found the the gameplay is really great
you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.299> voice<00:01:45.780> acting<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you know it's a the voice acting on the

have noticed in that cutscene there that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.699 
have noticed in that cutscene there that
the<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.540> was<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.020> really<00:02:39.170> clear

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the it was it was a really clear

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.190 
the it was it was a really clear
transition<00:02:40.250> between<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:41.330> low<00:02:41.660> textured

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200

buildings and the high texture ones and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.390 
buildings and the high texture ones and
I<00:02:44.650> find<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.160> bit

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
I find that just a little bit

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.630 
I find that just a little bit
distracting<00:02:46.970> but<00:02:47.260> we<00:02:48.260> can<00:02:48.410> get<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.190> little

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
distracting but we can get a little

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.330 
distracting but we can get a little
closer<00:02:50.000> here<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.510> see<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.830> detail<00:02:52.190> on

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
they put a lot of attention in that but

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.010 
they put a lot of attention in that but
we<00:02:57.980> can<00:03:01.000> try<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.270> think<00:03:02.420> about<00:03:02.510> too<00:03:02.840> much
