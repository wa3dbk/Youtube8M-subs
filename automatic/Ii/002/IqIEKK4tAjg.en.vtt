00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
how to utilize expressions in order to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.450 
how to utilize expressions in order to
make<00:00:10.980> your<00:00:11.460> life<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:12.030> an<00:00:12.150> animator<00:00:12.450> easier<00:00:13.460> as

you<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:14.820> see<00:00:14.940> here<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.299> two<00:00:15.570> balls<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.170> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
you can see here I have two balls and I

you can see here I have two balls and I
have<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.580> diving<00:00:17.850> boards<00:00:18.330> they're<00:00:19.199> kind<00:00:19.560> of

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
have to diving boards they're kind of

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.609 
have to diving boards they're kind of
primitive<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:21.029> job<00:00:21.300> done<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.439> what

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
primitive but they get job done so what

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.400 
primitive but they get job done so what
I<00:00:22.650> want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.939> an<00:00:24.090> animator<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.050> okay

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
I want to do as an animator is like okay

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
I want to do as an animator is like okay
I<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> ball<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.220> bounce<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> diving

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
I want the ball to bounce on the diving

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
I want the ball to bounce on the diving
board<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.779> diving<00:00:28.140> board<00:00:28.380> will<00:00:28.529> Bend<00:00:28.769> which<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
board the diving board will Bend which I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.049 
board the diving board will Bend which I
put<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.380> deformer<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.880> went

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
put a deformer on well actually it went

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
put a deformer on well actually it went
away<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:34.170> fix<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:41.510> okay<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.410> go

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
away you fix that and okay there we go

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.910 
away you fix that and okay there we go
so<00:00:44.360> there's<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> de<00:00:45.510> former<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so there's a de former on it and as you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
so there's a de former on it and as you
can<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.070> i<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:48.000> select<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> curvature<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
can see i just select the curvature and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.549 
can see i just select the curvature and
i<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.680> move<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.760> board<00:00:50.969> back<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> forth<00:00:51.629> now

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
i can move the board back and forth now

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
i can move the board back and forth now
as<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.070> animator<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.610> i<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> animate

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
as an animator if i was going to animate

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.330 
as an animator if i was going to animate
that<00:00:54.480> i<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:55.020> bounce<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.500> ball<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> down

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that i would bounce the ball up and down

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.330 
that i would bounce the ball up and down
and<00:00:56.640> key<00:00:57.629> frame<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and key frame it then I would have to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.080 
and key frame it then I would have to
select<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> bend<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.109> curvature<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
select the bend and then curvature and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.700 
select the bend and then curvature and
set<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.350> really

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
set this up but that can be really

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
set this up but that can be really
tedious<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.939> keep<00:01:06.420> trying<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.229> like

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
tedious as I keep trying to get in like

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.000 
tedious as I keep trying to get in like
fine-tuned<00:01:08.040> stuff<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.570> close

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
fine-tuned stuff as I get really close

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.120 
fine-tuned stuff as I get really close
to<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.549> board<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> keep<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.950> back

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
to the board I have to keep going back

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
to the board I have to keep going back
to<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.490> Bend<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to this Bend here so what I'm going to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.240 
to this Bend here so what I'm going to
do<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> set<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.040> something

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
do is I'm going to set up something

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
do is I'm going to set up something
similar<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:19.200> I've<00:01:19.590> done<00:01:19.770> over<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
similar to what I've done over here and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
similar to what I've done over here and
basically<00:01:21.720> I've<00:01:22.710> set<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> ball<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
basically I've set this ball here and I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
basically I've set this ball here and I
created<00:01:24.360> what's<00:01:24.630> called<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:25.140> attribute<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
created what's called an attribute and I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.819 
created what's called an attribute and I
placed<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> channel<00:01:27.240> box<00:01:27.829> now

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
placed it here in the channel box now

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
placed it here in the channel box now
all<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> select<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
all I have to do is I have to select the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.649 
all I have to do is I have to select the
ball<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:32.340> used<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.909> expression

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
ball and I i have used an expression

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.319 
ball and I i have used an expression
that<00:01:34.159> if<00:01:35.159> i<00:01:35.600> select<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.799> actually

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
that if i select this i can actually

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
that if i select this i can actually
still<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> ball<00:01:39.869> selected<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
still have the ball selected and use the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
still have the ball selected and use the
bounciness<00:01:41.570> which<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> named

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
bounciness which is what I named

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.940 
bounciness which is what I named
attribute<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.430> create<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.710> diving<00:01:46.710> boards

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
attribute to create the diving boards

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
attribute to create the diving boards
Bend<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.090> keep<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.630> back<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
Bend so I don't keep going back and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
Bend so I don't keep going back and
forth<00:01:49.140> between<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.890> two<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.399> extremely

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
forth between the two this is extremely

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
forth between the two this is extremely

is<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.579> simple<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.540> easy<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
is actually simple to do so it's easy to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.609 
is actually simple to do so it's easy to
get<00:02:07.439> across<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.899> first<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.020> need<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.410> which

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
get across so first I need to know which

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.830 
get across so first I need to know which
one<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> want<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.450> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.750> be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
one I want what I'm going to be

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.370 
one I want what I'm going to be

animating
at<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> time<00:02:13.710> in<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:15.270> case<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.960> would<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
at the time in this case it would be the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.290 
at the time in this case it would be the
ball<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.040> need<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.490> would<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> have

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
ball because I need I would like to have

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.200

curvature<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.240> get<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.630> i'm<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:45.990> to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
curvature so to get that i'm going to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.440 
curvature so to get that i'm going to
select<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.770> curvature<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.490> i'm<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.330> go

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
select the curvature and i'm going to go

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.360 
select the curvature and i'm going to go
to<00:02:48.510> edit<00:02:48.840> accessions<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.220> going<00:02:50.310> to

to edit accessions and it's going to
pull<00:02:50.550> up<00:02:50.640> my<00:02:50.760> expression<00:02:51.300> window<00:02:51.570> now<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.290> I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
pull up my expression window now what I

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.980 
pull up my expression window now what I
have<00:02:52.560> here<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.190> bend<00:02:53.460> three<00:02:53.990> curvature

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
have here is the bend three curvature

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.490 
have here is the bend three curvature
attribute<00:02:55.950> here's<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.880> object<00:02:57.330> over<00:02:58.260> here

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
attribute here's the object over here

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.040 
attribute here's the object over here
and<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:59.220> curvature<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.790> here<00:03:00.210> so<00:03:00.750> i'll<00:03:00.840> place

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and the curvature is here so i'll place

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.790 
and the curvature is here so i'll place
it<00:03:01.080> here<00:03:01.470> let<00:03:02.280> me<00:03:02.370> scale<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
it here let me scale this for you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.640 
it here let me scale this for you
alright<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.000> see<00:03:06.150> bin<00:03:06.420> three<00:03:06.960> dot

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
alright so as you can see bin three dot

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.010 
alright so as you can see bin three dot
curvature<00:03:08.520> now<00:03:09.330> i<00:03:09.600> need<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:11.780> equal<00:03:12.780> an

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
curvature now i need it to equal an

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.660 
curvature now i need it to equal an
attribute<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:13.830> i<00:03:13.890> need<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> create<00:03:14.490> the

and<00:04:08.150> now<00:04:09.150> I'm<00:04:09.390> just<00:04:09.600> got<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.750> equal<00:04:09.990> it

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
and now I'm just got to equal it

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.120 
and now I'm just got to equal it
remember<00:04:11.340> my<00:04:11.820> name<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.810> my<00:04:12.930> object<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.530> was<00:04:13.770> p

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
remember my name of my object it was p

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.080 
remember my name of my object it was p
sphere<00:04:15.080> one<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:17.190> attribute<00:04:17.730> which<00:04:17.970> i

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
sphere one and the attribute which i

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.490 
sphere one and the attribute which i
just<00:04:18.330> created<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.260> case-sensitive

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
just created and this is case-sensitive

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.240 
just created and this is case-sensitive
is<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:22.310> balance<00:04:23.310> eNOS<00:04:24.440> okay

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
is a balance eNOS okay

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.500 
is a balance eNOS okay
so<00:04:26.730> it's<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.570> bend<00:04:28.260> three<00:04:28.860> dot<00:04:29.550> curvature<00:04:30.270> is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
so it's a bend three dot curvature is

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.370 
so it's a bend three dot curvature is
equal<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.140> P<00:04:31.560> sphere<00:04:32.160> one<00:04:32.490> dot<00:04:32.790> bounciness

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
equal to P sphere one dot bounciness

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.230 
equal to P sphere one dot bounciness
because<00:04:34.380> here's<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.650> object<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.940> here's<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
because here's the object and here's the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.330 
because here's the object and here's the
attribute<00:04:36.660> now<00:04:37.410> all<00:04:37.770> I'm<00:04:37.920> going<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.100> do<00:04:38.220> is

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
attribute now all I'm going to do is

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.060 
attribute now all I'm going to do is
create<00:04:38.640> close<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:40.170> then<00:04:40.320> i'll<00:04:40.440> select<00:04:40.680> my

create close and then i'll select my

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.700 
create close and then i'll select my
ball<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.610> then<00:04:42.360> i'll<00:04:42.480> select<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.050> attribute

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
ball and then i'll select the attribute

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.890 
ball and then i'll select the attribute
that<00:04:43.740> i<00:04:43.920> had<00:04:44.250> i'm<00:04:45.000> holding<00:04:45.360> down<00:04:45.480> control

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
that i had i'm holding down control

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.540 
that i had i'm holding down control

the ball is still selected and i can

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.540 
the ball is still selected and i can
still<00:04:49.950> manipulate<00:04:50.100> my<00:04:50.610> object<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:52.380> i<00:04:52.740> hope
