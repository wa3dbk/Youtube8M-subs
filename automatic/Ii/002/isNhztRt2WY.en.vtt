when the rock appears live via satellite

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.630 
when the rock appears live via satellite
but<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.650> okay<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:10.920> CM<00:03:11.190> Punk<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.460> do<00:03:11.550> it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
but it's okay for CM Punk to do it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.370 
but it's okay for CM Punk to do it
because<00:03:11.850> he's<00:03:12.150> there<00:03:12.360> every<00:03:12.390> week<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.200> one

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.300 
night appearing live by satellite I
think<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.210> accept<00:03:15.540> CM<00:03:16.350> Punk<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> WWE

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
think we can accept CM Punk with the WWE

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.590 
think we can accept CM Punk with the WWE
Championship<00:03:17.760> saying<00:03:17.970> he<00:03:18.090> didn't<00:03:18.330> steal<00:03:18.570> it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
Championship saying he didn't steal it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.060 
Championship saying he didn't steal it
from<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.959> rock<00:03:19.110> because<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.590> WWE

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
from the rock because the WWE

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.260 
from the rock because the WWE
Championship<00:03:20.489> was<00:03:20.610> his<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.940> first<00:03:21.150> place

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
Championship was his in the first place

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.360 
Championship was his in the first place
I<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.230> CM<00:03:22.440> Punk<00:03:22.470> stole<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> title<00:03:23.130> back

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
I like that CM Punk stole the title back

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.190 
I like that CM Punk stole the title back
I<00:03:23.610> wasn't<00:03:24.000> too<00:03:24.150> happy<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.570> CM<00:03:24.780> Punk<00:03:24.810> lost<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
I wasn't too happy that CM Punk lost the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.840 
I wasn't too happy that CM Punk lost the
chairmanship<00:03:25.530> wasn't<00:03:26.250> particularly<00:03:26.550> mad

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
chairmanship wasn't particularly mad

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.160 
chairmanship wasn't particularly mad
that<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.150> rock<00:03:27.270> won<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> because<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.989> fan

that the rock won it because I'm a fan
of<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.410> rock<00:03:28.560> but<00:03:29.070> it's<00:03:29.340> quite<00:03:29.550> an

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
of the rock but it's quite an

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.310 
of the rock but it's quite an
interesting<00:03:29.880> mix<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> story<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.959> make<00:03:31.050> CM

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
interesting mix to the story to make CM

this Sunday I have a feeling that

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.279 
this Sunday I have a feeling that
they're<00:04:23.970> going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.180> lose<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:24.840> I'd<00:04:25.050> really

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
they're going to lose but I'd really

Rhodes<00:04:48.400> taking<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.910> loss<00:04:49.060> for<00:04:49.720> no<00:04:49.840> real<00:04:50.080> reason

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
Rhodes taking a loss for no real reason

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.200 
Rhodes taking a loss for no real reason
I<00:04:50.710> think<00:04:51.100> that<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.310> best<00:04:51.490> move<00:04:51.669> here<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:52.060> to

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
I think that the best move here is to

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.670 
I think that the best move here is to
put<00:04:52.389> team<00:04:52.600> Rhodes<00:04:52.810> Scholars<00:04:52.900> back<00:04:53.350> together

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
put team Rhodes Scholars back together

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.620 
put team Rhodes Scholars back together
because<00:04:54.370> since<00:04:54.550> breaking<00:04:54.759> up<00:04:55.030> Cody<00:04:55.449> Rhodes

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
because since breaking up Cody Rhodes

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.450 
because since breaking up Cody Rhodes
and<00:04:55.900> Damien<00:04:56.350> Sandow<00:04:56.680> have<00:04:56.889> just<00:04:57.070> been<00:04:57.190> taking

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
and Damien Sandow have just been taking

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.890 
and Damien Sandow have just been taking
losses<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:58.030> they<00:04:58.419> haven't<00:04:58.600> really<00:04:58.720> had<00:04:58.840> much

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
losses and they haven't really had much

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.110 
losses and they haven't really had much
direction<00:04:59.380> so<00:05:00.039> I<00:05:00.070> think<00:05:00.160> at<00:05:00.370> this<00:05:00.460> point<00:05:00.550> is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
direction so I think at this point is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.430 
direction so I think at this point is
probably<00:05:01.539> best<00:05:01.750> especially<00:05:02.169> around

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
probably best especially around

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.379 
probably best especially around
WrestleMania<00:05:03.100> season<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.610> just<00:05:03.820> team<00:05:04.000> up<00:05:04.030> Cody

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
WrestleMania season to just team up Cody

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.879 
WrestleMania season to just team up Cody
Rhodes<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:04.750> Damien<00:05:05.080> Sandow<00:05:05.380> again<00:05:05.620> because

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
Rhodes and Damien Sandow again because

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.439 
Rhodes and Damien Sandow again because
