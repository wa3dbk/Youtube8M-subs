electrolysis<00:03:31.700> we<00:03:32.390> were<00:03:32.510> able<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.750> break<00:03:33.020> down

gases hydrogen and oxygen also we

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.050 
gases hydrogen and oxygen also we
observe<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.340> ratio<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.730> these<00:03:43.880> two

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
observe that the ratio of these two

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.780 
observe that the ratio of these two
gases<00:03:44.270> are<00:03:44.690> two<00:03:45.020> parts<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.590> hydrogen<00:03:46.130> for<00:03:46.550> one

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790
