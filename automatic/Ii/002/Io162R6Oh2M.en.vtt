00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.240 
tyty section so I'm just gonna place a
pig's<00:00:04.560> eye<00:00:05.180> on<00:00:06.379> to<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:08.719> petri<00:00:09.719> dish<00:00:09.900> now<00:00:10.250> now

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
pig's eye on to the petri dish now now

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.870 
pig's eye on to the petri dish now now
you<00:00:12.059> see<00:00:12.290> it's<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.009> bit<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.190> liquid<00:00:14.370> over<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
you see it's got a bit of liquid over it

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.490 
you see it's got a bit of liquid over it
and<00:00:15.030> that's<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.690> alcohol<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.350> we've

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and that's just the alcohol that we've

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.580 
and that's just the alcohol that we've
used<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.859> preserve<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:19.140> there<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
used to preserve it so that there is a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.050 
used to preserve it so that there is a
pig's<00:00:20.160> eye<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:22.189> that<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.580> part<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.850> I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
pig's eye and that the first part that I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.929 
pig's eye and that the first part that I
section<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> open<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.849> I'll

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
section is to just get it open so I'll

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.250 
section is to just get it open so I'll
do<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.570> piercing<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> scalpel<00:00:30.260> so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
do this by piercing it with a scalpel so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.340 
do this by piercing it with a scalpel so
a<00:00:31.820> scalpel<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.390> an<00:00:33.809> instrument<00:00:34.140> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a scalpel is just an instrument that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.850 
a scalpel is just an instrument that
used<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.680> dissect<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:36.380> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
used to dissect with you can see it

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
used to dissect with you can see it
there<00:00:38.070> yes<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:41.670> quite<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> tough<00:00:42.329> surface

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
there yes and it's quite a tough surface

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.000 
there yes and it's quite a tough surface
to<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.110> through<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.680> why<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to get through so that's why I have to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.430 
to get through so that's why I have to
use<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.309> sharp<00:00:44.820> scalpel<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> little

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
use this sharp scalpel see that little

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.350 
use this sharp scalpel see that little
bit<00:00:46.559> liquid<00:00:46.890> coming<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.550> well<00:00:48.800> vitreous<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
bit liquid coming out as well vitreous I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.630 
bit liquid coming out as well vitreous I
think<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> name<00:00:51.780> given<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
think is the name given to the kind of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.020 
think is the name given to the kind of
jelly<00:00:53.940> liquid<00:00:54.539> inside<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> eye<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.030> that's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
jelly liquid inside the eye and that's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
jelly liquid inside the eye and that's
just<00:00:57.300> used<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> keep<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> pressure<00:00:58.109> inside

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just used to keep the pressure inside

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.430 
just used to keep the pressure inside
the<00:00:58.770> eye<00:00:59.090> cracked<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.960> guys<00:01:01.170> don't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the eye cracked so the guys don't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.020 
the eye cracked so the guys don't
explode<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.840> trucks<00:01:03.840> too<00:01:04.199> much<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> gel

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
explode or trucks too much so this gel

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
explode or trucks too much so this gel
stays<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.670> same<00:01:08.700> density<00:01:09.740> throughout<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
stays the same density throughout a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.350 
stays the same density throughout a
right<00:01:11.100> wide<00:01:11.490> range<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.360> temperatures<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:14.360> now

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
right wide range of temperatures so now

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.410 
right wide range of temperatures so now
just<00:01:15.390> cuts<00:01:16.350> ink<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.790> eye<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
just cuts ink around the eye and the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.179 
just cuts ink around the eye and the
cutting<00:01:18.810> through<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.830> retina<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
cutting through the retina and the

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.300 
cutting through the retina and the
sclera<00:01:23.450> here<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.439> black<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.130> can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
sclera here so the black of it you can

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.950 
sclera here so the black of it you can
start<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.689> amazing<00:01:28.140> insight<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
start to see amazing insight is the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.770 
start to see amazing insight is the
retina<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> white<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
retina and the white that you do see on

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.550 
retina and the white that you do see on
the<00:01:33.930> outside<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> Yowie<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.729> gallery

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.630 
coming out now it's also bit of muscle
in<00:02:34.480> there<00:02:34.750> that's<00:02:35.350> quite<00:02:35.500> tough<00:02:36.010> fibrous

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
in there that's quite tough fibrous

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.710 
in there that's quite tough fibrous
stiff<00:02:38.130> yeah<00:02:39.130> make<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.730> made<00:02:39.970> out<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.210> proteins

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
stiff yeah make it made out of proteins

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.790 
stiff yeah make it made out of proteins
so<00:02:43.720> later<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.400> you'll<00:02:45.400> see<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> video<00:02:46.620> coming<00:02:47.620> up

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
so later on you'll see a video coming up

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
so later on you'll see a video coming up
firms<00:02:48.130> I'll<00:02:48.460> do<00:02:48.670> they<00:02:49.080> make<00:02:50.080> some<00:02:50.230> slides

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
firms I'll do they make some slides

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.310 
firms I'll do they make some slides
microscope<00:02:51.820> slides<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.780> these

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
microscope slides that is if these

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.100 
microscope slides that is if these
different<00:02:53.710> parts<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> eye<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.990> got

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
different parts of the eye so we got

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.680 
different parts of the eye so we got
some<00:02:56.320> muscle<00:02:56.970> probably<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> cross-section<00:02:58.600> of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
some muscle probably a cross-section of

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.950 
some muscle probably a cross-section of
the<00:02:58.780> lens<00:02:58.990> part<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.560> retina<00:03:00.090> Irish<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.810> on

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
the lens part of the retina Irish so on

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.260 
the lens part of the retina Irish so on
we'll<00:03:02.440> see<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.710> iris<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:03.880> later<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
we'll see the iris bit later the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.790 
we'll see the iris bit later the
dissection<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.870> though<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.020> see<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.470> that's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
dissection so though you see that that's

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.940 
dissection so though you see that that's
empty<00:03:09.100> now<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.580> bit<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> eye<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:14.530> using

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
empty now a bit the eye so just using

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.000 
empty now a bit the eye so just using
the<00:03:15.100> scalpel<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.880> carefully<00:03:16.690> peel<00:03:17.590> back<00:03:17.800> this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
the scalpel to carefully peel back this

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.630 
the scalpel to carefully peel back this
retina<00:03:18.870> which<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.530> black<00:03:20.709> coating<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:21.550> the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
retina which is the black coating on the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.350 
retina which is the black coating on the
inside<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> eye<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.209> we<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.690> see

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
inside of the eye that we can see

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.770 
inside of the eye that we can see
unfortunately<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.810> sticks<00:03:26.790> quite<00:03:27.790> well<00:03:28.030> to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
unfortunately it sticks quite well to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.210 
unfortunately it sticks quite well to
this<00:03:28.900> gallery<00:03:30.000> which<00:03:31.000> means<00:03:31.709> it's<00:03:32.709> quite<00:03:33.040> hard

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
this gallery which means it's quite hard

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.160 
this gallery which means it's quite hard
to<00:03:33.310> peel<00:03:33.550> off<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.540> show<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.870> become<00:03:37.920> so

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
to peel off just to show it become so

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.500 
to peel off just to show it become so
there<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.260> go<00:03:41.290> it's<00:03:41.650> not<00:03:42.160> really<00:03:43.030> coming<00:03:43.270> off

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
there we go it's not really coming off

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.140 
there we go it's not really coming off
as<00:03:44.350> well<00:03:44.560> as<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.860> would<00:03:44.920> have<00:03:45.100> hoped<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.850> this

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
as well as I would have hoped in this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.220 
as well as I would have hoped in this
dissection<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.430> probably<00:03:48.430> be<00:03:48.580> end<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
dissection but probably be end of the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.490 
dissection but probably be end of the
video

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
video

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.900 
video
soon<00:03:50.860> enough<00:03:51.180> where<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.360> does<00:03:52.570> work

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.280 

so<00:03:57.420> I'm<00:03:57.900> just<00:03:58.050> gonna<00:03:58.140> cut<00:03:58.680> using<00:03:59.220> the<00:04:00.290> scissors

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
so I'm just gonna cut using the scissors

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.340 
so I'm just gonna cut using the scissors
again<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:03.270> we're<00:04:03.420> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.810> try<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.200> do

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
again and what we're going to try and do

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.380 
again and what we're going to try and do
now<00:04:04.560> let's<00:04:05.190> take<00:04:05.400> out<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.840> cornea<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:08.390> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
now let's take out the cornea and the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.790 
now let's take out the cornea and the
iris<00:04:09.920> not<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.070> gather<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:13.200> cornea<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.620> like

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
iris not so gather so the cornea is like

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.880 
iris not so gather so the cornea is like
the<00:04:13.920> first<00:04:14.190> layer<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:15.000> your<00:04:15.270> eye<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
the first layer on your eye and it's a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.930 
the first layer on your eye and it's a
clear<00:04:17.540> coating<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.989> then<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.370> color<00:04:20.640> which

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
clear coating and then the color which

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.840 
clear coating and then the color which
in<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.180> case<00:04:21.360> is<00:04:21.510> blue<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:23.190> iris<00:04:25.730> you<00:04:26.730> can

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
in this case is blue is the iris you can

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.910 
in this case is blue is the iris you can
see<00:04:27.060> if<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.390> look<00:04:27.540> at<00:04:27.660> your<00:04:27.780> own<00:04:27.930> eyes<00:04:28.140> or<00:04:28.560> look

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
see if you look at your own eyes or look

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.260 
see if you look at your own eyes or look
at<00:04:29.040> someone<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.340> look<00:04:29.790> at<00:04:29.880> your<00:04:29.970> own<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.210> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
at someone so look at your own in the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.460 
at someone so look at your own in the
mirror<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:32.100> iris<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.640> cycle<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.570> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
mirror the iris and the cycle and the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.910 
mirror the iris and the cycle and the
cornea<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:36.000> also<00:04:36.150> see<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:37.590> iris

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
cornea you can also see that the iris

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.840 
cornea you can also see that the iris
also<00:04:39.020> contracts<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:42.030> goes<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:43.640> all<00:04:44.640> of

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
also contracts and it goes in all of

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.020 
also contracts and it goes in all of
that<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.570> it's<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.770> help<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.100> bring<00:04:48.000> in

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
that so it's it to help you bring in

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.740 
that so it's it to help you bring in
different<00:04:48.870> amounts<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.590> light<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.040> if<00:04:50.220> you're

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
different amounts of light so if you're

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.320 
different amounts of light so if you're
looking<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.050> dark<00:04:52.350> then<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.850> Irish<00:04:54.150> might

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
looking in the dark then the Irish might

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.420 
looking in the dark then the Irish might
open<00:04:54.600> up<00:04:54.720> quite<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.140> bit<00:04:55.470> like<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.890> letting<00:04:56.310> in

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
open up quite a bit like it letting in

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.010 
open up quite a bit like it letting in
lots<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:56.970> light<00:04:57.590> but<00:04:58.590> if<00:04:59.070> you're<00:04:59.340> in<00:04:59.550> a<00:05:00.020> very

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
lots of light but if you're in a very

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.330 
lots of light but if you're in a very
bright<00:05:01.260> environment<00:05:01.890> snowy<00:05:02.220> environment

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
bright environment snowy environment

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.060 
bright environment snowy environment
let's<00:05:03.060> say<00:05:03.270> then<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.290> Irish<00:05:04.500> closes<00:05:04.920> up

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
let's say then the Irish closes up

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.130 
let's say then the Irish closes up
fighting<00:05:05.370> in<00:05:05.520> less<00:05:05.760> light<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:06.390> help<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.870> focus

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
fighting in less light to help you focus

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.820 
fighting in less light to help you focus
on<00:05:08.300> certain<00:05:09.300> objects<00:05:09.630> now<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.380> black<00:05:10.710> that

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
on certain objects now the black that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.560 
on certain objects now the black that
you<00:05:10.890> can<00:05:10.980> see<00:05:11.070> coming<00:05:11.430> off<00:05:11.610> now<00:05:11.790> is<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.150> retina

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
you can see coming off now is the retina

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.730 
you can see coming off now is the retina
finally<00:05:13.230> it's<00:05:13.650> peeled<00:05:13.980> off<00:05:14.810> is<00:05:15.810> quite<00:05:16.650> an

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
finally it's peeled off is quite an

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.140 
finally it's peeled off is quite an
awkward<00:05:16.830> face<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.490> see<00:05:17.700> part<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.030> the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
awkward face and you see part of the

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.840 
awkward face and you see part of the
iris<00:05:19.020> attached<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.980> that<00:05:20.070> retina<00:05:20.610> which<00:05:20.820> is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
iris attached to that retina which is

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.740 
iris attached to that retina which is
that<00:05:21.120> ring<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.140> see<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:26.030> yeah<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.300> so

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
that ring that you can see so yeah so so

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.780 
that ring that you can see so yeah so so
far<00:05:27.930> we've<00:05:28.140> got<00:05:28.170> the<00:05:28.730> lens<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.930> retina<00:05:31.790> the

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
far we've got the lens the retina the

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.130 
far we've got the lens the retina the
Scott<00:05:33.210> skeller<00:05:34.460> got<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.550> liquid<00:05:35.910> the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
Scott skeller got the liquid the

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:44.540 
Scott skeller got the liquid the
vitreous<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:41.160> am<00:05:42.060> just<00:05:42.660> about<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.990> cut<00:05:43.550> now

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
vitreous and I am just about to cut now

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.760 
vitreous and I am just about to cut now
to<00:05:44.610> get<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.120> cornea<00:05:45.720> which<00:05:45.930> as<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.260> say<00:05:46.440> is<00:05:46.590> that

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
to get the cornea which as I say is that

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.440 
to get the cornea which as I say is that
actually<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.340> coating<00:05:47.820> that<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.090> got<00:05:48.270> on<00:05:48.360> the

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
actually a coating that you got on the

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.250 
actually a coating that you got on the
eye<00:05:48.590> which<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.740> can<00:05:49.920> see<00:05:50.730> if<00:05:51.450> you<00:05:51.960> look<00:05:51.990> at

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
eye which you can see if you look at

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.770 
eye which you can see if you look at
your<00:05:52.410> own<00:05:52.560> eyes<00:05:52.740> something<00:05:56.540> that's<00:05:57.540> quite<00:05:57.720> a

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
your own eyes something that's quite a

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.380 
your own eyes something that's quite a
bit<00:05:57.960> work<00:05:58.140> getting<00:05:58.860> this<00:05:59.010> off<00:05:59.220> he<00:06:00.000> has<00:06:00.150> made<00:06:00.300> it

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
bit work getting this off he has made it

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.230 
bit work getting this off he has made it
very<00:06:00.420> tough<00:06:00.660> so<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.410> doesn't<00:06:01.800> break<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.850> as

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
very tough so it doesn't break and as

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.790 
very tough so it doesn't break and as
many<00:06:03.480> cells<00:06:03.780> thick<00:06:05.870> but<00:06:06.870> you<00:06:07.440> do<00:06:07.530> have<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.740> be

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
many cells thick but you do have to be

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.900 
many cells thick but you do have to be
careful<00:06:07.950> with<00:06:08.160> your

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
careful with your

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.930 
careful with your
they<00:06:09.240> don't<00:06:09.449> recover<00:06:10.139> what's<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:10.800> damaged<00:06:11.160> if

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
they don't recover what's the damaged if

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.990 
they don't recover what's the damaged if
you<00:06:12.270> damage<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.780> nerves<00:06:13.020> and<00:06:13.949> the<00:06:14.280> the

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
you damage the nerves and the the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.379 
you damage the nerves and the the
sensing<00:06:15.870> cells<00:06:16.290> at<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.650> back<00:06:16.830> of<00:06:16.860> your<00:06:17.040> eye

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
sensing cells at the back of your eye

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.650 
sensing cells at the back of your eye
they<00:06:18.389> don't<00:06:18.570> grow<00:06:18.720> back<00:06:18.960> but<00:06:20.419> stem<00:06:21.419> cell

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
they don't grow back but stem cell

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.100 
they don't grow back but stem cell
research<00:06:22.050> is<00:06:22.169> really<00:06:22.860> not<00:06:23.130> wrong<00:06:23.510> recently<00:06:24.510> so

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
research is really not wrong recently so

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.810 
research is really not wrong recently so
that<00:06:25.290> way<00:06:25.470> what<00:06:25.919> you<00:06:25.979> can<00:06:26.100> see<00:06:26.280> in<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:26.669> in

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
that way what you can see in the in

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.400 
that way what you can see in the in
tweezers<00:06:27.419> forceps<00:06:28.169> is<00:06:28.530> the<00:06:28.919> cornea<00:06:29.550> and<00:06:30.169> a<00:06:31.169> bit

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
tweezers forceps is the cornea and a bit

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.140 
tweezers forceps is the cornea and a bit
the<00:06:31.500> buckling<00:06:31.860> outside<00:06:32.250> is<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.669> bit<00:06:33.000> of<00:06:33.090> the

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
the buckling outside is a bit of the

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.659 
the buckling outside is a bit of the
retina<00:06:34.250> and<00:06:35.250> that<00:06:35.820> right<00:06:36.000> there<00:06:36.030> is<00:06:36.600> the

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
retina and that right there is the

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.170 
retina and that right there is the
skullery<00:06:40.250> now<00:06:41.250> what<00:06:41.639> you<00:06:41.729> can<00:06:41.820> see<00:06:41.880> in<00:06:42.120> the

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
skullery now what you can see in the

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.120 
skullery now what you can see in the
middle<00:06:42.540> at<00:06:42.690> the<00:06:42.720> back<00:06:42.960> there<00:06:43.229> that's<00:06:43.650> just

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
middle at the back there that's just

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.100 
middle at the back there that's just
that<00:06:44.250> there<00:06:44.490> is<00:06:45.560> part<00:06:46.560> of<00:06:46.710> the<00:06:47.360> nerve<00:06:48.360> which<00:06:48.900> we

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
that there is part of the nerve which we

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.860 
that there is part of the nerve which we
had<00:06:49.200> sent<00:06:50.100> all<00:06:50.400> of<00:06:50.430> the<00:06:50.669> eye<00:06:50.700> signals<00:06:51.360> down

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
had sent all of the eye signals down

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.990 
had sent all of the eye signals down
your<00:06:52.050> spinal<00:06:52.290> cord<00:06:52.530> to<00:06:53.070> brain<00:06:53.370> so<00:06:53.639> you<00:06:53.880> can

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
your spinal cord to brain so you can

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.900 
your spinal cord to brain so you can
actually<00:06:54.120> see<00:06:54.870> because<00:06:55.770> you<00:06:56.160> brain<00:06:56.669> is<00:06:56.700> the

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
actually see because you brain is the

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.390 
actually see because you brain is the
part<00:06:56.940> larger<00:06:57.419> processes<00:06:57.930> that<00:06:58.830> the<00:06:59.040> signals

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
part larger processes that the signals

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.820 
part larger processes that the signals
that<00:06:59.490> come<00:06:59.729> from<00:06:59.880> your<00:07:00.060> eye

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
that come from your eye

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.650 
that come from your eye
so<00:07:01.830> your<00:07:02.070> eye<00:07:02.100> is<00:07:02.430> a<00:07:02.460> sense<00:07:02.820> organ<00:07:03.300> which<00:07:03.450> can

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
so your eye is a sense organ which can

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.870 
so your eye is a sense organ which can
say<00:07:03.840> in<00:07:03.900> sense<00:07:04.229> cells<00:07:04.530> which<00:07:04.860> are<00:07:05.070> a<00:07:05.310> special

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
say in sense cells which are a special

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.879 
say in sense cells which are a special
light-sensitive<00:07:06.840> cells<00:07:07.139> in<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.620> back<00:07:07.740> of<00:07:07.830> the

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
light-sensitive cells in the back of the

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.680 
light-sensitive cells in the back of the
eye<00:07:10.520> and<00:07:11.520> what<00:07:11.820> I'm<00:07:11.910> peeling<00:07:12.060> off<00:07:12.270> now<00:07:12.419> is<00:07:12.600> a

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
eye and what I'm peeling off now is a

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.659 
eye and what I'm peeling off now is a
bit<00:07:12.840> of<00:07:12.900> muscle<00:07:13.139> so<00:07:13.919> there's<00:07:14.100> always<00:07:14.220> muscle

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
bit of muscle so there's always muscle

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.990 
bit of muscle so there's always muscle
and<00:07:14.910> the<00:07:15.120> eye<00:07:15.150> which<00:07:15.990> helps<00:07:16.320> to<00:07:16.470> fit<00:07:17.220> it<00:07:17.370> in<00:07:17.550> to

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
and the eye which helps to fit it in to

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.360 
and the eye which helps to fit it in to
the<00:07:18.090> an<00:07:18.180> eye<00:07:18.210> socket

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.330 

so<00:07:28.870> it's<00:07:29.870> not<00:07:30.290> an<00:07:30.410> easy<00:07:30.530> dissection<00:07:31.250> because

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
so it's not an easy dissection because

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:38.370 
so it's not an easy dissection because
it's<00:07:31.580> quite<00:07:31.760> a<00:07:31.790> small<00:07:32.620> object<00:07:33.620> to<00:07:34.270> dissect<00:07:35.590> but

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380 
it's quite a small object to dissect but

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.330 
it's quite a small object to dissect but
hopefully<00:07:39.380> you<00:07:39.560> can<00:07:39.620> see<00:07:39.890> the<00:07:40.040> different

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
hopefully you can see the different

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.830 
hopefully you can see the different
parts<00:07:40.400> coming<00:07:40.820> together<00:07:41.030> now<00:07:41.360> and<00:07:41.600> see<00:07:41.720> how

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 
parts coming together now and see how

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.350 
parts coming together now and see how
they<00:07:42.020> all<00:07:42.050> do<00:07:42.620> fit<00:07:42.920> together<00:07:43.280> in<00:07:43.460> the<00:07:43.550> night<00:07:43.730> as

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 
they all do fit together in the night as
