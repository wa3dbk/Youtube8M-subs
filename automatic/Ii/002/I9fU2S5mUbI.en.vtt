and<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:41.489> having<00:00:41.640> trouble<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and I'm having trouble with this one of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.090 
and I'm having trouble with this one of
the<00:00:42.690> maps<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> trouble<00:00:44.010> with

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the maps I have a lot of trouble with

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
the maps I have a lot of trouble with
doing<00:00:44.430> well<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> basically<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> do

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

doing well on and so basically what I do
is<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.160> pretty<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.370> run<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> motion<00:00:48.000> sensor

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is I pretty much run the motion sensor

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
is I pretty much run the motion sensor
on<00:00:48.420> everything<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.079> ghost<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> annoying

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
on everything because ghost is annoying

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
on everything because ghost is annoying
as<00:00:50.280> shit<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> can't<00:00:51.059> rely<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.510> your<00:00:51.600> spy

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
as shit and you can't rely on your spy

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.290 
as shit and you can't rely on your spy
plane<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.489> use<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> spy<00:00:54.000> plane

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
plane because of it so use the spy plane

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
plane because of it so use the spy plane
to<00:00:54.449> judge<00:00:54.660> spawns<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> ghost<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> judge

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to judge spawns and the ghost to judge

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
to judge spawns and the ghost to judge
my<00:00:56.250> ass<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.020> what<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> motion<00:00:58.350> sensor<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
my ass and what the motion sensor to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
my ass and what the motion sensor to
judge<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.070> ass<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> i<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
i like to basically clip behind the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.250 
i like to basically clip behind the
sport<00:01:03.059> live<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.359> people<00:01:03.690> continually

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
come right up here through the gate as I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750 
come right up here through the gate as I
got<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> RC<00:01:07.439> car<00:01:07.470> right<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.400> mentally

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
got the RC car right now but I mentally

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.910 
got the RC car right now but I mentally
switch<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> UAV<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.200> mean<00:01:10.530> RC

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
switch that back out the UAV I mean RC

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
switch that back out the UAV I mean RC

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
loading see now they have flipped onto

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.830 
loading see now they have flipped onto
me<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.210> talking<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
me so I was talking about about the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.620 
me so I was talking about about the
spawn<00:01:37.110> look<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:38.400> generally<00:01:39.329> you're<00:01:39.479> like

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
spawn look I was generally you're like

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.770 
spawn look I was generally you're like
if<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> modern<00:01:40.290> warfare<00:01:40.470> 2<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.070> cod4

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
if this is a modern warfare 2 or cod4

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
if this is a modern warfare 2 or cod4
even<00:01:42.780> world<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.140> war<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> right<00:01:43.770> here

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
even world at war this right here

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.090 
even world at war this right here
wouldn't<00:01:44.130> happen<00:01:45.649> basically<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> spawns

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
wouldn't happen basically the spawns

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
wouldn't happen basically the spawns
have<00:01:47.340> flipped<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.090> top<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> me<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
have flipped right on top of me and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
have flipped right on top of me and
they're<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> spawn<00:01:49.470> consistently

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
they're going to spawn consistently

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
they're going to spawn consistently
right<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.899> something<00:01:52.170> unique

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
right here and this is something unique

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
right here and this is something unique
to<00:01:52.649> black<00:01:52.979> ops<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> was

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
