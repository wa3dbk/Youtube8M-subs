00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 is that you've ever wondered what 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 have become the characters of gta iv 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.790
 not that's good I either east to 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.790
 more 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.639
 wow this intro rotten summer hi to 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.960
 all I'm not galloping and today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.580
 we will answer a question rather 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.020
 interesting that became the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.340
 characters of gta iv 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.990
 it is true that we often forget them in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.340
 passing from one generation to another but 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.720
 normally they are supposed to continue 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.040
 their lives quietly and then while 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.880
 lens at fifth opus they are often 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.590
 cited or even presented so the first 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
 convoys in the game are yellowed and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.970
 ashley from episodes from liberty city who 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
 have moved to 110 rooms with the gang 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.760
 lost in passing we notice that he 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.480
 became totally addicted to the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.640
 methamphetamine 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.220
 Johnny gets fucked by Trevor 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.760
 you know it and ashley she's dead 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.110
 of a road accident 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.120
 then we see terry and clegg who are 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.940
 also members of the lost and who also go 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 get slaughtered by trevor afterwards 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.280
 looking a little in the game we can 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 find newspapers with for wholesale 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.629
 titles love it will h a chips and this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.869
 text what will surely speak about the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.739
 death of young people during kinematics 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.930
 before the jewelery robbery 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.610
 leicester speaks of an Irish family 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.159
 which of course a reference to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.110
 hands credit and then he talks about a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 you guys east europe who was doing 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 liberticide courses and there I you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.030
 admit that I had a hope in front of nico 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.830
 in the game but after he tells us just 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 that he retired from his criminal life 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.190
 I think we've all been 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.110
 disappointed one can also notice in 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.340
 the barrel lojack inc at the entrance there is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 a jacket that looks suspiciously like 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.460
 that of nico and a picture of him in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.620
 a tow truck that is from elsewhere 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930
 only present in water stand 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.200
 when michael mancini hear it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.100
 shouted well it's a reference to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.600
 beginnings of gta iv 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.810
 when we hear credits and the same 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.810
 thing 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.240
 then we can find a poster 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.979
 wanted to nico in the game is the most 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.870
 interesting his part flyff invaders on 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.160
 the pc of 10 me I think it's mr is 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.470
 the most important because it allows 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.990
 to be sure that nico and romane his alive 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.729
 that the good end of gta iv and seven countries 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.440
 who dies that nico and returns live to 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.280
 broker and that he's a taxi driver for the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.810
 his cousin's company 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.880
 if you have watched the credits of 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.660
 ballad of gay tony we do not see who year 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.070
 in an airport 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.720
 so we could know advanced who 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.740
 would be present in gta 5 if you 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.250
 recruit for the robbery of the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.140
 jewelry 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.610
 he will introduce himself and tell you he is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.350
 come malo santos to earn money 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.640
 and if you take it in the second 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.260
 robbery he will teach you that are 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.790
 Frederic is dead and that nycole 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.140
 probably also it's pretty strange 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.490
 of spruces by the way because when he 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.110
 left liberty city he was still at 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.400
 you probably remember Michel 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.930
 or rather than at this dark reindeer 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.430
 traitor who worked for the yeah 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.900
 yeah well she appears in a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.270
 kinematics of gta 5 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.380
 we can notice that she has become 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.850
 a lot later and dangerous 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.380
 by the way his eyes have become bhl 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.880
 it is not by what witchcraft it is 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.110
 possible but they became blue and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.090
 of course because it did not come to los 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.340
 santos own boss and duarte 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.050
 Fortune aka ul paper is also 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.580
 come we see several funds we can 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.770
 even the drill bit in a cape town mold 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.770
 the michael by the fbi and the yeah yeah 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.480
 case as is not present in the game 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.920
 but on the page of tavel clinton the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.330
 franklin's cousin there is a message that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.280
 says he shares an apartment with 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:13.200
 two Jamaicans at the talking ltte 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:14.430
 probably from jacob and bad leads to 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.470
 passage in the same place we can read a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.820
 beautiful nicholson message it stays a 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.080
 hypothesis but I think it does 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.710
 part of the family of this bell yarn 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.420
 that he is the same the last is good 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.530
 sure fat that can be called in gt 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.480
 online to buy him from the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.210
 shark testosterone freeways 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.800
 none do not know which helps to increase 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.720
 the damage done during fifty 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.920
 seconds it's shit we can also 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.330
 see his website where he explains the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.280
 crap that the wind and he also 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.540
 posted a few posts on twitter to the 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 page 22 and 38 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.590
 important 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.030
 I could have told you about the freighter 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.410
 in the port that strangely resembles 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.120
 the one who nick will have taken to get to 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.560
