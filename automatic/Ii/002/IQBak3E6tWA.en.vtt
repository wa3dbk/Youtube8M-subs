00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.050
 thank you very much 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:39.100
 balanced running performance in 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:41.940
 avant cock well and settled operation 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 people a good 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:58.030
 who also within the masses 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:01:00.790
 later we had with our side 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.010
 association can give more 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 some comments but within what the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:13.149
 oil as a spectator and lover of the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.090
 breed and i believe to be a model horse 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:20.649
 can follow the andrÃ© will give some 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.810
 comments here is also a good day to 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.990
 all 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.219
 agrees that with the mauro he 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.479
 visualizing animals we notice that he 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:34.299
 has an even more complicated picture 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.889
 have a little bit more support 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.409
 side of that diagonal is best 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:44.549
 well balanced again having the dwarf 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.079
 very balanced male of 68 the couple 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.170
 probably with good wheat times and 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.310
 I also support good stability 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.609
 mainly not be negative in the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.419
 croup he may be sinning 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:01.109
 little all over the world believe in 

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:13.209
 croup without noticing it gives a 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:14.830
 girl is very stable and has money to 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.800
 complementary that the planet speaking 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.349
 I see a concussion is not a mother's 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.920
 side he does not let go girl 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.830
 shot with him most horses 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.140
 which is very neat and we see that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.280
 his croup does not know the sides she 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.580
 has a friction and cohesion attrition and let's 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.040
 to say so it is very natural for a horse to 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.880
 sting is the dynamics of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.220
 his training maybe an exit from 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.670
 not a little later it would decrease 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.970
 This shakes and shakes and we'll say 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.970
 so his front and side he does not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.120
 now ask the boy to cross in the middle 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.120
 of the track and driving on the other hand 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:15.040
 I see that the ease of league and 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.920
 other side easily and 11 not 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.400
 disrupts or slows down 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:39.270
 and neither changes the tempo 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:43.170
 No, do not change your hand, do not give a change. 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.170
 of kanaan position 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:55.000
 so the chance and onward 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.099
 so he has a March income 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.349
 It's very good because I think that's it. 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:05.140
 that we would like to give 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:11.110
 Congratulations and congratulate the work. 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.970
 well done and innovation so this model 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:21.989
 2011 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:21.989
 I think it's very rare to see the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.010
 final considerations 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.740
 I think the mauro has said everything so much in a 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.570
 singing and tracking very good movie and 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.030
 a style of walking that pleases 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.020
 many people that he has a position of 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.860
 head of the doll flexed, I do not live anymore 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.419
 without grand exaggeration at an ideal point 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.030
 this march is the Xavante really 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.490
 creepy has no clumsy rise 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.880
 less of a horse has a great 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:06.010
 potential and thanks can rest and 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.210
 get together with other colleagues possible 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.210
 and thank you 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.639
 now we are going to present the horse that 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:28.710
 we made a 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:31.710
 the owner of Friday and Saturday participated 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.710
