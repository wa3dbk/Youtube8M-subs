00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.639 
where we've got e-minor and G major
pentatonic<00:00:06.120> scales<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.870> are<00:00:07.049> related<00:00:07.410> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
pentatonic scales that are related to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.350 
pentatonic scales that are related to
each<00:00:07.770> other<00:00:08.010> they've<00:00:08.280> got<00:00:08.519> common<00:00:09.059> notes

each other they've got common notes

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.440 
each other they've got common notes
we've<00:00:10.170> also<00:00:10.349> got<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.010> relative<00:00:11.730> major

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
we've also got a relative major

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.560 
we've also got a relative major
pentatonic<00:00:12.990> scale<00:00:13.530> from<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> minor<00:00:14.670> so

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
pentatonic scale from the a minor so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.200 
pentatonic scale from the a minor so

string<00:00:18.480> 5<00:00:18.980> we're<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.220> miss<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> no

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
string 5 we're going to miss that no

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.340 
string 5 we're going to miss that no
doubt<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.449> time<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.109> start

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
doubt this time we're going to start

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
doubt this time we're going to start
from<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> next<00:00:22.949> note<00:00:23.100> up<00:00:23.310> from<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> scale

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
from the next note up from the scale

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.130 
from the next note up from the scale
which<00:00:24.570> was<00:00:24.750> fret<00:00:24.990> 3<00:00:25.430> 1<00:00:26.430> string<00:00:26.760> 5<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
which was fret 3 1 string 5 and that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310 
which was fret 3 1 string 5 and that
note<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.619> AC<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.840> time<00:00:31.019> we're<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.260> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
note is AC so this time we're going to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.580 
note is AC so this time we're going to
play<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> C<00:00:32.099> major<00:00:32.399> pentatonic<00:00:33.000> scale<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.410> we're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
play a C major pentatonic scale so we're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.729 
play a C major pentatonic scale so we're
starting<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.579> fret<00:00:36.030> 3<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.590> go

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
starting from this fret 3 and we go

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.209 
starting from this fret 3 and we go
straight<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.760> open<00:00:39.750> string<00:00:40.050> 4<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.800> remember<00:00:41.100> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
straight to open string 4 so remember we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
straight to open string 4 so remember we
use<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> same<00:00:42.149> notes<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.649> minor

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
use all of the same notes from the minor

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.660 
use all of the same notes from the minor
scale<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.120> open<00:00:45.539> string<00:00:45.870> 4<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
scale so open string 4 and then we go to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.619 
scale so open string 4 and then we go to
fret<00:00:48.360> 2<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.680> string<00:00:50.100> 4<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:51.600> to

fret<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.449> string<00:01:01.440> 2<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.329> our<00:01:03.629> octave

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fret one string 2 so that is our octave

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
fret one string 2 so that is our octave
because<00:01:04.769> starting<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> base<00:01:05.909> note<00:01:06.180> for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
because starting from the base note for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.240 
because starting from the base note for
at<00:01:06.479> three<00:01:06.750> string<00:01:07.020> 5c<00:01:07.860> we've<00:01:08.549> got<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.180> two

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
at three string 5c we've got one two

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.679 
at three string 5c we've got one two
three<00:01:11.250> four<00:01:12.020> five<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.280> next<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
three four five and the next is the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.890 
three four five and the next is the
octave<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.640> carry<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.090> there<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.750> go

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
octave so for carry on from there we go

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.550 
octave so for carry on from there we go
straight<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.740> fret<00:01:20.490> 3<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.330> our<00:01:21.869> second<00:01:22.409> string

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
straight to fret 3 on our second string

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.700 
straight to fret 3 on our second string
and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.330> straight<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.900> open<00:01:25.229> string<00:01:25.470> 1

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and then we go straight to open string 1

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.470 
and then we go straight to open string 1
and<00:01:26.330> then<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.600> straight<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.320> fret<00:01:28.619> 3

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
and then we go straight to fret 3

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480 
and then we go straight to fret 3
now<00:01:31.080> we've<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.650> too<00:01:31.830> many<00:01:31.920> notes<00:01:32.130> there

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
now we've not got too many notes there

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
now we've not got too many notes there
in<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.760> second<00:01:33.240> octave<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.870> we're<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in that second octave so we're going to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530 
in that second octave so we're going to
have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> shift<00:01:34.830> quite<00:01:35.280> high<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.360> neck

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
have to shift quite high at the the neck

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
have to shift quite high at the the neck
of<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.720> guitar<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.290> order<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> go<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of the guitar in order to go to the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 
of the guitar in order to go to the
second<00:01:38.490> octave<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.910> C<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.960> however<00:01:40.230> got<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
second octave of C so however got this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530 
second octave of C so however got this
if<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.950> want<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.730> we're<00:01:41.940> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> shift<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
if you want so we're going to shift a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.660 
if you want so we're going to shift a
whole<00:01:42.720> hand<00:01:42.960> position<00:01:43.410> up<00:01:43.560> including<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.370> thumb

whole hand position up including a thumb
two<00:01:44.970> frets<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.660> finger<00:01:46.080> three<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.410> now<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.680> fret

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
two frets so finger three is now in fret

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
two frets so finger three is now in fret
5<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:48.180> my<00:01:49.020> top<00:01:49.320> string<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.720> still

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
5 of my top string and then that's still

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
5 of my top string and then that's still
not<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.440> I<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.980> one<00:01:53.550> more<00:01:53.790> note<00:01:54.030> in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
not see I need to go one more note in

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600 
not see I need to go one more note in
the<00:01:54.360> scale<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.110> time<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.740> three

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the scale so this time I'm going three

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630 
the scale so this time I'm going three
frets<00:01:56.970> higher<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.660> up<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> 48<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.830> string

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
frets higher right up to 48 on string

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.530 
frets higher right up to 48 on string
one<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.700> there's<00:02:02.970> my<00:02:03.150> second

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
one so there's see there's my second

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
one so there's see there's my second
octave
