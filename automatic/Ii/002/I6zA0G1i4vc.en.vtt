have you ever seen any sculpture that
wasn't<00:00:40.400> as<00:00:40.490> beautiful<00:00:41.030> as<00:00:41.150> that

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
wasn't as beautiful as that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.160 
wasn't as beautiful as that
something<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:43.280> would<00:00:43.490> hang<00:00:43.700> on<00:00:43.790> my<00:00:43.940> wall

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
something that I would hang on my wall

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.020 
something that I would hang on my wall
before<00:00:45.170> these<00:00:45.470> air<00:00:45.710> ducts<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.490> air<00:00:46.640> first

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
before these air ducts the air first

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.570 
before these air ducts the air first
goes<00:00:47.300> on<00:00:47.630> the<00:00:47.810> bottom<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.530> mirror<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.100> the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
goes on the bottom of the mirror and the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.350 
goes on the bottom of the mirror and the
mirror<00:00:50.210> leads<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.860> airflow<00:00:52.340> into<00:00:53.030> the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
mirror leads the airflow into the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.100 
mirror leads the airflow into the
cooling<00:00:53.930> pit<00:00:54.590> here<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:58.130> end<00:00:58.310> of<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.640> car<00:00:59.110> here

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
cooling pit here the end of the car here

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.920 
cooling pit here the end of the car here
and<00:01:00.320> here<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.490> can<00:01:01.610> feel<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.150> hot<00:01:02.360> air<00:01:02.630> coming

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
and here you can feel the hot air coming

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.820 
and here you can feel the hot air coming
out<00:01:04.059> on<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.180> bottom<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.050> real<00:01:06.200> trick<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.650> that

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
out on the bottom the real trick is that

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.130 
out on the bottom the real trick is that
it's<00:01:06.980> made<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.430> carbon<00:01:07.820> fiber<00:01:08.030> panels<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.840> mean

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's made of carbon fiber panels I mean

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.350 
it's made of carbon fiber panels I mean
old<00:01:09.440> cover<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:10.460> all<00:01:10.610> carbon<00:01:11.000> fiber<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
old cover it's all carbon fiber the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.330 
old cover it's all carbon fiber the
toughest<00:01:11.840> carbon<00:01:12.230> fiber<00:01:12.470> they<00:01:12.980> wanted<00:01:13.250> to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
toughest carbon fiber they wanted to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.150 
toughest carbon fiber they wanted to
make<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.640> out<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:14.330> aluminum<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:15.710> they<00:01:16.010> found

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
make it out of aluminum but they found

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.070 
make it out of aluminum but they found
out<00:01:16.370> that<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:16.670> would<00:01:16.880> ways<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.450> would<00:01:17.900> wait

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
out that it would ways it would wait

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.650 
out that it would ways it would wait
about<00:01:18.320> 100<00:01:19.100> kilos<00:01:19.370> more<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:20.150> can<00:01:20.270> even<00:01:20.420> adjust

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
about 100 kilos more you can even adjust

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.440 
about 100 kilos more you can even adjust
the<00:01:21.020> speed<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.070> gearbox<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.850> you're

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
the speed of the gearbox that you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.200 
the speed of the gearbox that you're
using<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.560> look<00:01:24.740> how<00:01:24.950> how<00:01:25.460> much<00:01:25.670> they've<00:01:25.970> used

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
using and look how how much they've used

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.930 
using and look how how much they've used
this<00:01:26.360> car<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:26.930> we're<00:01:27.200> now<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.190> our<00:01:28.280> 30,000

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
this car so we're now this is our 30,000

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.790 
this car so we're now this is our 30,000
kilometers<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.720> says<00:01:30.070> 0<00:01:31.070> 15<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.020> probably

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
kilometers it says 0 15 so it's probably

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.100 
kilometers it says 0 15 so it's probably
the<00:01:34.130> prototype<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.240> will<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.660> look<00:01:35.750> after

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
the prototype I will have to look after

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.450 
the prototype I will have to look after
that<00:01:41.200> change<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.380> modes<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> car<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.250> just

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
that change the modes in the car it just

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.490 
that change the modes in the car it just
changes<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.450> colors<00:01:44.810> even<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.290> needle

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
changes the colors even the needle

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.520 
changes the colors even the needle
changes<00:01:46.220> if<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:46.940> want<00:01:47.210> like<00:01:47.479> look<00:01:48.380> at<00:01:48.500> this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
changes if you want like look at this

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.679 
changes if you want like look at this
okay<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.829> would<00:01:52.369> suggest<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.299> start<00:01:53.329> in

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
okay I would suggest you to start in

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.300 
okay I would suggest you to start in
normal<00:01:53.840> mode<00:01:54.079> because<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.740> will<00:01:54.890> be<00:01:55.009> much<00:01:55.250> more

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
normal mode because it will be much more

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:18.190 
normal mode because it will be much more
aggressive<00:01:55.610> on<00:01:56.090> Egypt

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.310 

the<00:02:43.350> microphones<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.310> video<00:02:44.690> art<00:02:45.690> leave

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
the microphones on that video art leave

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:57.839 
the microphones on that video art leave
off<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.740> recording<00:02:47.190> anything<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.760> this

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
small things like the seats the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.440 
small things like the seats the
air-conditioned<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.400> everything<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.150> just

air-conditioned and everything is just

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.410 
air-conditioned and everything is just
working<00:03:02.379> perfectly<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.280> could<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> little

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
working perfectly I could do a little

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.390 
working perfectly I could do a little
