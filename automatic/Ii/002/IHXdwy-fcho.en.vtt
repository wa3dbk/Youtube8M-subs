success<00:02:15.220> absolutely<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.250> mean<00:02:16.390> two<00:02:17.390> things<00:02:17.420> I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
success absolutely I mean two things I

guess pricing design form factor making

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.380 
guess pricing design form factor making
it<00:02:24.050> really<00:02:24.200> very<00:02:24.950> pocketable<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:26.210> ease

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
it really very pocketable and then ease

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.600 
it really very pocketable and then ease
of<00:02:26.570> use<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.990> mean<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.380> product<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.250> plum
