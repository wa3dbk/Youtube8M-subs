00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.039
 I had very clear that I wanted to show you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 party look and for this I have brought you 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.420
 a very special place is a store 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 where the creations of 33 are sold 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 different designers all of them 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 Irish or Irish residents 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.360
 because in fact although outside of these 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 borders is believed otherwise dublin 2 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.469
 a very creative capital is in fact a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 focus of young designers of on clothes 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.910
 of jewelry shoes and many of them 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 they sell their creations here you breathe 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 a very creative very cool mind very 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.460
 dynamic because in fact some of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 these designers even have their 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.179
 workshops right here so like the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.289
 Irish are so nice let's see if 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.289
 they let us snoop around a bit 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.230
 Well look, I think we 've had 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.300
 luck and let's find one of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.040
 them working right here is phillip and 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.520
 is a designer of jewelry with the feeling 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.140
 how are you doing and what are you doing 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.690
 I'm finishing this elaborate necklace 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.970
 with silver and resin 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.040
 it's amazing that there are singing the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.510
 colors thanks always to the degree 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.280
 use colors that go well between 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.930
 them as in the case of the orange and the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.950
 blue and in the entire collection I have 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.710
 combined these colors 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.110
 if they are incredible and here you have a 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 scoop a full creative process 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.289
 cooking of this necklace that surely 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.060
 we will see in the streets of Dublin in a few 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.189
 how many weeks or maybe maximum in about 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.189
 months many thanks 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.609
 here I am rummaging through the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.560
 party proposals the truth is that the 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.960
 Most are long dresses like this 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 which I find incredible but I think that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.740
 final I will decide for this other 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.659
 short not only because I get 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 appointment and friends feel dresses better 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.710
 short but because I think it's much more 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.500
 versatile a long dress like this is not 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.239
 you can put it for a cocktail or for 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.680
 go out at night however this one 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.540
 you can put it with a headdress for a 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.310
 wedding but also with a perfect 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720
 leather and some boots to get out of that is 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.010
 what I like about fashion 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.160
 play with the clothes that I have in my 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.160
 closet 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.860
 I do not know about you but he asks me to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 screams a headdress because it is that I also 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 they love here they have many models 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.310
 different I will fight and still would not have 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.260
 logical I stay with this church where 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.910
 I'm passionate but I think I need a 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.490
 touched when you suggest 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.500
 There are some that I will recommend this 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.180
 dress is awesome you do not get 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.490
 would go very well a headdress that will contrast 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.410
 with your hair so we can start with 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.900
 this this headdress is made with 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.450
 golden raffia and has a rubber explains it 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.420
 that allow you to place fabric underneath 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.420
 of the hair let me be perfect 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.610
 in a letter but maybe we should try 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.610
 a little more 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.239
 we do not want something that is so similar to 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.939
 dress let's try another piece 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.340
 this is a piece of the collection of the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.579
 royalty is made with the technique 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.810
 of the olive tree or god seriously if we are going to see 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.810
 leave hair like this 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.140
 I love him because he's half the final and 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.940
 very strange 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.810
 It is a very worked piece and very 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.810
 complicated to do 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.550
 and I really love what kind of bag 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.870
 carry ideas with both the other touched 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.879
 as with this means 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.980
 if you wear this headdress that contrasts 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:56.599
 very good with your hair we should opt 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.599
 for a light color clutch 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.710
 with the same details of the dress yes 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.710
 I love really love it 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.110
 to 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.849
 yes
