00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
see me try to take him on a couple of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
see me try to take him on a couple of
times<00:01:30.329> he's<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> wizard<00:01:31.500> he's<00:01:31.740> not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
times he's just like a wizard he's not

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.289 
times he's just like a wizard he's not
that<00:01:32.040> hard<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> kill<00:01:32.520> he<00:01:32.670> actually<00:01:32.790> has<00:01:33.090> even

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that hard to kill he actually has even

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
that hard to kill he actually has even
less<00:01:33.479> HP<00:01:33.689> than<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> wizard<00:01:34.290> does<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.829> he<00:01:34.890> has<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
less HP than a wizard does but he has a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440 
less HP than a wizard does but he has a
little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.460> defense<00:01:35.759> his<00:01:35.939> attacks<00:01:36.270> are

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
little bit more defense his attacks are

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.609 
little bit more defense his attacks are
relatively<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> same<00:01:36.990> though<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> don't

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
relatively the same though I don't

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.810 
relatively the same though I don't
actually<00:01:37.799> remember<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.400> called<00:01:38.460> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
actually remember what it's called but

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
actually remember what it's called but
you<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.780> anywhere<00:01:39.960> near<00:01:40.079> him

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you don't want to be anywhere near him

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.780 
you don't want to be anywhere near him
because<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:40.650> does<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> lot<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> damage<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because he does a lot of damage and you

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160 
because he does a lot of damage and you
probably<00:01:42.000> can't<00:01:42.270> kill<00:01:42.450> him<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> time<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.049> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
probably can't kill him in time I know I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
probably can't kill him in time I know I
tried<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> couple<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.100> times<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.640> video

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
tried it a couple of times in this video

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
tried it a couple of times in this video
and<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.420> able<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.409> any<00:01:46.590> rate<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and I was not able to at any rate so the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
and I was not able to at any rate so the
basic<00:01:47.280> strategy<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
basic strategy from here on out is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.600 
basic strategy from here on out is
you're<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> wait<00:01:49.799> eventually<00:01:50.369> zai

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you're just going to wait eventually zai

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.039 
you're just going to wait eventually zai
or<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.360> walk<00:01:51.509> into<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> room

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
or will actually walk into the room

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
or will actually walk into the room
directly<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.920> front<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.640> show

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
directly in front of you and I will show

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.429 
directly in front of you and I will show
this<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> very<00:01:54.390> end<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.659> video<00:01:54.810> now

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this at the very end of the video now

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
this at the very end of the video now
this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.649> how<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> thorn<00:01:56.610> weapon<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
this is how you get the thorn weapon it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
this is how you get the thorn weapon it
is<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> last<00:01:57.570> major<00:01:57.869> step<00:01:58.259> before<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
is the last major step before you go to

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
is the last major step before you go to
the<00:01:58.979> speaker<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.729> last<00:02:00.000> time<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.360> actually

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the speaker one last time to actually

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.270 
the speaker one last time to actually
pick<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> weapon<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.680> typically<00:02:02.070> what

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
pick up the weapon now typically what

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
pick up the weapon now typically what
you<00:02:02.369> want<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.240> sit<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.689> your

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
sniper I use the Icebreaker because I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.429 
sniper I use the Icebreaker because I
didn't<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> worry<00:02:06.899> about<00:02:07.020> ammo

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
didn't have to worry about ammo

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.809 
didn't have to worry about ammo
respawning<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.369> wanted<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.759> able

less HP than a wizard or at least it

less HP than a wizard or at least it
seemed<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.010> way<00:03:06.250> because<00:03:06.549> she<00:03:06.819> went<00:03:07.000> down

the last shot he even told me on the

the last shot he even told me on the
microphone<00:03:13.930> which<00:03:14.169> made<00:03:14.319> me<00:03:14.439> very<00:03:14.469> very<00:03:14.709> happy

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
microphone which made me very very happy

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.520 
microphone which made me very very happy
but<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.790> point<00:03:16.030> after<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.569> she<00:03:17.349> comes

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
but the point after that is she comes

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.569 
but the point after that is she comes
into<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.799> room<00:03:17.889> right<00:03:18.069> in<00:03:18.099> front<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.459> and

into the room right in front of you and

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.890 
into the room right in front of you and
just<00:03:18.639> sits<00:03:18.940> there<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:19.510> just<00:03:19.659> spam

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
just sits there and you can just spam

usually<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.030> don't<00:03:22.180> even<00:03:22.359> think<00:03:22.479> it<00:03:22.629> took<00:03:22.750> more

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
usually I don't even think it took more

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.119 
usually I don't even think it took more

that is back up behind you in the
ceiling<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:29.830> actually<00:04:30.069> very<00:04:30.099> very<00:04:30.370> high<00:04:30.669> up

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
ceiling it's actually very very high up

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.219 
ceiling it's actually very very high up
and<00:04:30.939> it's<00:04:31.090> very<00:04:31.240> difficult<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.629> get<00:04:31.780> there<00:04:31.960> if

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
and it's very difficult to get there if

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.050 
and it's very difficult to get there if

double jump ability and the increased

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.439 
double jump ability and the increased
height<00:04:36.069> so<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.520> could<00:04:36.729> go<00:04:36.879> up<00:04:36.999> there<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.300> try
