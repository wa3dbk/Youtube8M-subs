00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
rebuilds after a cut you know it grows a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.970 
rebuilds after a cut you know it grows a
scar<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.750> scar<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.110> usually<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.650> little

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
skin around it for a reason because your

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.309 
skin around it for a reason because your
body<00:02:40.940> doesn't<00:02:41.239> want<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.750> open<00:02:41.870> up<00:02:42.080> again

and the same way muscle regrows after

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.520 
and the same way muscle regrows after
your<00:02:44.330> lifting<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.780> break<00:02:45.080> down<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.440> the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.920 
and he didn't have time to rebuild and
regrow<00:04:31.550> stronger<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.750> was<00:04:32.870> just

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
regrow stronger so it was just

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.320 
regrow stronger so it was just
continuing<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.740> break<00:04:33.890> down<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.490> then<00:04:34.970> just

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
continuing to break down and then just

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.700 
continuing to break down and then just
that<00:04:35.450> freak<00:04:35.690> accident<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.140> comes<00:04:36.290> down<00:04:36.410> boom

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
that freak accident it comes down boom

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.950 
that freak accident it comes down boom
it<00:04:36.919> snaps<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.460> I'm<00:04:37.820> sure<00:04:38.060> Anderson<00:04:38.540> Silva<00:04:38.810> was

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
it snaps and I'm sure Anderson Silva was

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.360 
it snaps and I'm sure Anderson Silva was
trained<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.410> up<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.650> up<00:04:39.919> until<00:04:40.220> probably
