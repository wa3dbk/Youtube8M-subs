grinding<00:00:46.950> issue<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> first<00:00:47.879> place<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
grinding issue in the first place and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.139 
grinding issue in the first place and
it's<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> common<00:00:49.680> techni<00:00:50.250> steak<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> field

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it's a common techni steak in the field

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's a common techni steak in the field
that's<00:00:51.719> causing<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> grind<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.309> point

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that's causing that grind at this point

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.779 
that's causing that grind at this point
in<00:00:53.730> time<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.530> what's<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> let's<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.730> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it's going to spin the Machine around

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080 
it's going to spin the Machine around
and<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.579> you've<00:01:02.699> ever<00:01:02.879> done

so<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.680> fusing<00:01:35.130> assembly<00:01:35.579> inside<00:01:35.880> here

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so if my fusing assembly inside here

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630 
so if my fusing assembly inside here
you've<00:01:36.869> done<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.170> before<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:38.460> out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you've done this before right take out

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
you've done this before right take out
my<00:01:38.790> fusing<00:01:39.210> assembly<00:01:39.689> I've<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> blue

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
my fusing assembly I've got the blue

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.590 
my fusing assembly I've got the blue
clip<00:01:41.009> down<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> bottom<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> holds

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
clip down on the bottom here that holds

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
clip down on the bottom here that holds
it<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.770> put<00:01:43.890> finger<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.460> top<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it in and I can put finger up on top and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.480

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
can slide my fusing assembly out yeah

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.780 
can slide my fusing assembly out yeah
I've<00:01:51.030> done<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.329> before<00:01:51.390> once<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.020> twice<00:01:52.790> so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
I've done this before once or twice so

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.969 
I've done this before once or twice so
looking<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.270> my<00:01:54.299> fusing<00:01:54.810> assembly<00:01:55.320> I've<00:01:55.590> got

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

down<00:02:25.980> below<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.550> gear<00:02:26.760> when<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.030> start

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
down below that gear when you start

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.210 
down below that gear when you start
seeing<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:27.990> pile<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.290> dust<00:02:28.710> forming

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
fusing assembly and the grinding went

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.640 
fusing assembly and the grinding went
away<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:42.060> temporarily<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:43.020> started<00:02:43.320> coming

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
away but temporarily they started coming

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.980 
away but temporarily they started coming
back<00:02:43.680> after<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.460> many<00:02:44.610> thousands<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.330> pages
