00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi everyone with you i am anthony today i am 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.890
 I would like to tell you about this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.019
 cool way how to quickly reach 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:15.030
 Level 50 minecraft 50 ur can't 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.430
 reach this one five minutes before i thought 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.720
 quite 5 minutes will be enough 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 actually what kind of a way is it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.180
 special card which is more accurate 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.640
 have done in the world endermen in that is in 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.460
 the interior where I will receive 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.650
 level for killing the internet here and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 let's tell more in detail well and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.460
 let me tell you a little about the idea itself 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.760
 and the author's idea 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 how did he plan to do 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.940
 realize this idea of course idea 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.219
 he completely succeeded and let's 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 I will tell you, that is, there are two 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.190
 such kind of block well under blocks 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.219
 between not just blocks amide blocks from 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.760
 other blocks that is here these here such 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.770
 Here is the fence and inside them 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 endermen them and they just 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 so many just 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 such a big slept is really here and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.310
 the trick is what happens when you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.479
 kill of them of course falls experiences 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.159
 this is the whole point in going to bed but 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.619
 this whole idea does not end 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.770
 beat every enderman falls i don't know well 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.720
 literally can 10 enders per second 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.180
 or I don't know in two seconds that is y 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.299
 im so quick just spawn what 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.979
 you don't have time to say something simple 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.720
 stand that is you will constantly 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.270
 compress the mouse button and raise yourself 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.150
 the level is actually this map 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.060
 fit in principle both for creative 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.790
 mode and for survival mode besides 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.250
 this here is still a bunch of different 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.310
 chests in which you can fold 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.520
 your various items you want 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.240
 there are also two levers here that is 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.700
 there is a doctor as you see here a lever 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.040
 they control the spawn that is our 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.860
 endermen of but this lever is responsible for 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.619
 here is this block from this lever name and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.180
 It is there from here until the end and that's 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.759
 besides this of course there is a book 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.519
 enchantment with which you can 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.890
 enchant but their things and the ball and i don't 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.170
 I know anything, that is the author really 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.870
 just all so I do not know but thought out here 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.819
 really well of course that's all for now 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.920
 only words so let's show in 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.930
 principle in fact about anything now 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.790
 i'm in creative mode like you already 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.780
 understood and still will not die for 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.250
 on the blow but not the essence let's a little bit 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.590
 I will show that I am here now quickly 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.019
 quickly quickly painted all 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.670
 enderman yeah fine they all die not 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:43.299
 see how quickly he rises to me 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:46.130
 level actually that is already here 9 10 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.799
 11 there is just the main thing even for children experience and 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.260
 collect here that is so fast 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.330
 There is a leveling that it's just 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.239
 really just go nuts and on 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.150
 In fact, the author when the authors really just 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.000
 I try to think it's all the details have 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.670
 it all just happened and very 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.950
 kosher shorter actually here 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.340
 see already 24 25 even level at the very 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.829
 business 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.019
 And I don't know 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.140
 more than a minute that is generally in my opinion 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.340
 it's just from people here that is endermen 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.459
 and it turns out they will always 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.510
 spawn and they will constantly die 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.170
 by date 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.400
 it's all super at all, but in any 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.970
 case now i'm in creative 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.859
 mode yes but the trick is also in 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.410
 that even if i go out 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.060
 creative mode and will continue to be 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.780
 endermen of they will still die 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.489
 with one poke 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.910
 and not even because I Mazanov sword and 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.220
 I just do nâ€™t even know what to be 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.859
 please even those steaks fried which 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.859
 we have a in the inventory at the very 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.350
 In fact, the trick is also that 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.790
 these endermen and when they spawn they fall 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.680
 big enough garden and here you can 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.370
 see what is there right here 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.959
 very high very very high and they 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.699
 fall from this height and they have 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.160
 so little life you can 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.829
 finish them off with one strike on the very 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.989
 really it's just go nuts well i'm real i 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.440
 just generally when I first saw 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.769
 it's just me, ofigel 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.480
 Well, let me do it the day to level 50 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.480
 I will accelerate this matter a little 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.100
 Well, in principle, I already got 50 and already 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.770
 not at this in general at the level of pumping 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.810
 i'm finished let's show you 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.720
 how does all this work even if i 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.210
 get out of the creative mode the game from 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.870
 0 and I'm not in creative mode now 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.500
 in fact now i'm just just in 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.010
 survival mode you let's I took steak 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.440
 that's 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.160
 as you see i kill with the first strike 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.840
 but also the trick is that 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.220
 at first you were asked to pumpkin on 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.690
 head you know pumpkin protects against 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.850
 Enderman strikes then axes are they just not you 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.160
 they are attacking you supposedly just do not see that 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.120
 There is an author so read everything just 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.150
 that he even teaches all the minor flaws 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.830
 Well, that's basically noticed that this 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.270
 everything can be done even without creative 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.479
 mode let me show you myself 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.190
 how looks more or less the outer 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.400
 I'll show you what's inside 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.620
 that is, our room looks like this and everything 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.440
 it's just doused with enderman 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.770
 They teleported here and is 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.750
 this 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.729
 at a very high enough height at 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.860
 in fact, that is, find something very 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.780
 high he is further here beyond that 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.740
 there are buttons with different 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.420
 repeaters which are actually 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.820
 activates the pistons that is here on Kaisa 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.530
 pistons here if you look closely yes here you are 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.940
 see and through each literally 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.180
 few seconds 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.460
 activated pistons that push 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.900
 all interns who fall here 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.310
 side curb and see he say so on 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.979
 really and 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.830
 damn really i'm just sitting right now and 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.349
 I think that the author is well thought out everything just 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.330
 all the little things really and this 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.770
 just go nuts real 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.360
 I did not know I'd never before this is not 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.310
 I thought it would pass and I would fall 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.740
 so let's take it another 1 this 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.199
 I still want to go out 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.900
 this is how our construction looks like 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.690
 she looks very impressive at the very 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.930
 in fact it is very big but on 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.180
 this about the construction is not all that is 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.370
 in this design there is also 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.410
 a kind of tunnel well i mean i 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.919
 I started from it, that is, I would immediately 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.800
 the tunnel 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:12.710
 and if you go further with this 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.330
 the tunnel can be long enough i will 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.330
 go i will speed up the process 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.830
 here you can go on such a thing and 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.380
 here go up and what awaits us 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.420
 upstairs and the room we have waiting portal batal 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.060
 which appears when killing a doctor 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.600
 kona and if we go down something like 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:39.510
 how the game all ours end well and on 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.150
 this all dear friends with you was me this 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:45.750
 do not subscribe to the channel download this 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:51.140
 map developer many thanks from 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.140
 even thought all of us and bye
