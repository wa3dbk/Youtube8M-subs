of<00:01:19.299> something<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:21.040> new<00:01:21.130> burst<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.549> something

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
of something the new burst of something

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.399 
of something the new burst of something
so<00:01:22.240> long<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:24.130> makes<00:01:24.340> up<00:01:24.549> and<00:01:25.330> it<00:01:26.049> makes<00:01:26.260> a

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
so long and it makes up and it makes a

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.530 
so long and it makes up and it makes a
noise<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:27.340> makes<00:01:27.640> another<00:01:27.909> knowing<00:01:28.360> about

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
noise it makes another knowing about

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.740 
noise it makes another knowing about
this<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:29.590> then<00:01:29.920> but<00:01:30.700> we<00:01:31.060> should<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.360> or<00:01:31.600> to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
this and then but we should this or to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.190 
this and then but we should this or to
it<00:01:31.869> does<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.110> same<00:01:32.140> thing<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.970> we<00:01:34.299> think<00:01:34.540> it's

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
it does the same thing so we think it's

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.289 
it does the same thing so we think it's
a<00:01:35.350> big<00:01:35.590> set<00:01:35.799> to<00:01:35.950> looking<00:01:36.430> for<00:01:36.640> another<00:01:36.850> one<00:01:37.090> we

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
a big set to looking for another one we

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.480 
a big set to looking for another one we
don't<00:01:37.479> know<00:01:37.600> if<00:01:37.720> there<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.020> another<00:01:38.320> one<00:01:38.530> well

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
don't know if there is another one well

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.039 
don't know if there is another one well
I<00:01:39.520> think<00:01:39.670> that's<00:01:40.150> amazing<00:01:40.600> stuff<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:43.049> tell

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
I think that's amazing stuff and so tell

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:57.420 
I think that's amazing stuff and so tell
me<00:01:44.080> what<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.470> think<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:45.400> comments<00:01:45.880> below

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430 

alright
