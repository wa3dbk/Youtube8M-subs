00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.369
 cologne sharks with effect 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.460
 The initial phase was in the blue 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.670
 had jerseys made strong efforts forward because the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.670
 Animals on marketing and what scares back 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.700
 otto

 for defender marc r goes to class 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.770
 preliminary work by danny briere 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.410
 cologne from a safe defensive always 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.540
 again with counter 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.550
 just a minute later the compensation 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.370
 by as well a counter charlie 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.680
 Stephens after the double pack on Tuesday 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 his third against Munich today 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.960
 the season 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.840
 that also stood after 20 minutes in the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.910
 Top game plays very well in the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.230
 defensive and very aggressive i did 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.089
 no game for almost half a year 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.380
 more done so a little faster 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.380
 but that is getting better 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.410
 in the second third but then the pass 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 from peer group on tommy approaches and then 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.320
 becomes very curious and classic 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.160
 owner of the polar bear last on the bus 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 lost life 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.830
 That's why the goal is credited to him 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.810
 but soon 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.390
 The culprit and the bush are 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.950
 one another trying to save the one 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.230
 others try to do better 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.690
 but then the puck landed in his own 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.060
 gate 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.400
 but also here the answer of the post 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.300
 berliner before and then comes from the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.550
 background of detention 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.530
 the lines fourth season goal of the 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.830
 compensation for the polar bears 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 accidental shot of women who 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:02.690
 chance and he uses 22 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.690
 the stand after the second third 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.470
 the final section and the kÃ¶lner sharks 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.900
 get better out of the belt john tripp 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:18.940
 the captain in the 46 minute with the 3 2 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.730
 and the second guide to the sharks 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.670
 but also the world just 62 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.670
 seconds then the big occurrence of 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.670
 superstar 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.880
 Hello 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 his first goal 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.100
 90 say so in the island met times 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.190
 now his first in the dl and it was 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:47.280
 a beautiful one untenable for danny 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.880
 from the birches the 50 minutes of play 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.520
 power play for the sharks 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.390
 and that's an announcement andreas wolf 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.090
 the swedish defender is a lot 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.580
 place far too much space examined the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.120
 corner out and again the leadership for the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.120
 leader 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.510
 the answer the iceberg of this postal customer 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.510
 laurin brown 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.050
 that you are not all days out 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.060
 the air came 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.060
 from claudia gray 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.970
 and it went on well a good one 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.160
 last third john tripp 53 minute 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.020
 after great preparation by charles darwin 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.240
 the 54th 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.600
 for the sharks that were on the verge 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.670
 the attendance of nhl stars thoroughly 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.120
 miraculous play about 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.940
 half desert and cola and the 6 to 4 only 28 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.489
 seconds after the management of the sharks 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.300
 the for the first time with two factors 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.300
 in leadership 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.180
 berlin fights berlin rackert berlin becomes 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.270
 it continues 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.470
 the tobacco and the connection 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.260
 They stand 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.290
 it should, too 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.040
 the culprit had been the cologne 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.070
 Haie win in Berlin and completely 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.070
 earned 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.780
 what do you say to the two new ones? 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.700
 players have just said 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.900
 played well 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.740
 how did you see the performance like that? 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:41.580
 from djourou and bring yes they are but 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.580
 they are parked 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.510
 I think we proved that today 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.070
 we have a good team 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.370
 It is not easy to win in Berlin 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.950
 and we have the german champion 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.670
 beaten officiating and was a very 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.490
 good service from us 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.980
 the sharks are expanding their table guidance 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.690
 the two stars will have noticed 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.230
 that in germany quite good 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.230
 played ice hockey
