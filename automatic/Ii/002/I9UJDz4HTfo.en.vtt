00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.109
 [Music] 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 halo halo halo halo friends welcome 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.910
 of the fuck fuck the mushroom fuck or what 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.070
 whether you want to be watching 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 because there are two channels and one is everything 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
 a little and the other is only dragon 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 ball for you for you that you are a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.669
 sick fan of this anime of this 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.009
 manga of this creation of Akira Toriyama 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.409
 there is a news flight 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.989
 more than interesting, the 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.420
 manga still the first episode that we 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.870
 is going to give the first data about it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.000
 of dragon ball super since as you 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
 they must be so aware nothing is known but 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.199
 there is a person who has filtered by 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.010
 example at the time the manga that 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.629
 was launching from the resurrection of fp ha 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 released other very interesting things in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.079
 the good past this person who 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.269
 evidently living in Japanese has 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 some kind of first-hand access or 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.719
 be at the first moment that this material 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 is available what he says is that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.090
 on the 15th of this month or possibly 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 what he says is that he's going to do it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 between 15 and 17 but good day 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.100
 June 15 to 18 we have the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 possibility that he makes us know 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 the first chapter of the dragon manga 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.550
 super ball I repeat the big jump magazine 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.700
 that's where this manga would be coming from 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.640
 it comes out of something like between 15 and 17 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 It is available every month then 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.520
 this boy between 15 and 18 of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.910
 June what it means in nothing is going to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.240
 be throwing the first first primer 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.330
 Super Dragon Ball Manga Episode 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 this could simply be an anecdote 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.530
 since the manga is not going to be the point 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.380
 strong of this how strong is going to be the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.030
 anime they are going to be throwing but 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.470
 because I find it so interesting clear 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.119
 because we do not have any information at 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.200
 about how to see the story only 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.369
 what is going to come a very enemy 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.640
 interesting and little more then this 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.860
 first expression that will put us 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.360
 points on the i's going to be able 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.520
 start to understand where we are 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 stopped what is going to happen more or 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.890
 less and obviously a start 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.540
 It is precisely precisely precisely to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.540
 the story we will start to understand 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.280
 a little bit of what the new story is like 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.250
 that people already know if you want to get there 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 this boy goyita to efe as they see it 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.350
 there on his facebook page and if not 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.850
 be attentive to this channel of the fuck tv 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.100

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.050

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.800
 all the information of dragon ball as 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.910
 I have always done in the past but in 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.890
 the last times for different 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.709

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.690
