00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.020
 We are live from average latin punta tv 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.060
 with the famous mega alejandro ortiz that 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.540
 I already had a nap for a few years 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.009
 but the issue of 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.000
 Bodybuilding here in Mexico is 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.379
 leaving very well 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.900
 impression and the 'champion of champions' 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.240
 many people are screaming ortiz 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.850
 go go go alex alejandro what 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.890
 it happens that now this looks so I think 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.960
 that all fellow friends are 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.640
 they prepare to win we all do 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.039
 our best effort and therefore equal to 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.010
 anyway, I need it whenever I 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.140
 mentally prepared if not try to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.570
 earn the number one but then all 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.020
 We make the same effort and it is for 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.840
 be able to go out to represent Mexico in a 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.420
 international that returns just the year 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.520
 past and that is the idea of ​​going back to 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.560
 good exposed a little weight you have a 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 very full chest a lot of muscular pumping 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.640
 you had a very complete package for 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.120
 endure any competition 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.770
 international easy this yes and even already 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.460
 I went to compete in North America in the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.309
 2008 and win 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.080
 from the 80 kilos category right now 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.390
 return and screaming weighing 88 kilos 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 then with the idea of ​​returning to power 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.360
 fight an absolute in North America or in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.720
 he with a classic weapon can get a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.670
 better place and if every year they are 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.119
 presenting more and more opportunities for 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.450
 the Latin athletes especially here 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.369
 in Mexico this now seems to be 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.320
 media is growing quite a lot because 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.770
