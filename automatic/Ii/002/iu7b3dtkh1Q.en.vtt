00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 Mr. Ken Hi Sagamihara Park Cranes It is great, but it is this time to introduce 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.950
 The ball is now on sale now Roto grip 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.289
 I would like to introduce a Defiant 1 child 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.230
 At first I would like to go to the pinker pap thing that 3/8 end bus pins at 5 inches 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.140
 Buffer We Yugai is 4 and 7/8 the balance 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:29.669
 This time we open in It is pin down here Difaiantekko previous work method plate flame 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.940
 And xl and cover stock is not good Nagano 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.890
 Paragon child is 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.610
 Now insight Pearl reactive but it is the same 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.590
 It is by becoming perl material hey 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.650
 The previous work also has a smooth skit feeling and it is also a feature of the paragon core 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 It seems to move very persistently 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:55.760
 It is a movement that is difficult to roland It is a pearl system but it is more than feeling clean 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.309
 2 pockets, such as going yacht that either 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.590
 It is a very easy-to-handle pearl ball because it is a reaction that goes along 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.640
 I think 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:10.390
 Please look by all means because the ball that I also really like 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.670
 Weave and the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.530
 The 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.340
 And here due to the influence of the coverstock, which is a hybrid of this and the coverstock 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.060
 It is an image that people react from the front so let's throw it
