What's up, guys. It's me, Cameron,
with DS2DIO 360 telling you what I love about

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.190
The Victory Dance ! Yes !

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.650
Since the dawn of time 
athletes, mascots, and even video game

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.199
characters have used the victory dance to
show how awesome they are and really

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.119
stick it to the losers. ppfff. At the London
2012 Olympics, the ladies US Soccer Team showed

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.980
that if its good enough for the mercenaries
on SOCOM 4, well it's good enough for them.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.040
After their victory against the North Koreans
the ladies started Kim Jong Illin' within

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.839
the stadium. Which kind of got me thinking
that even if dance isn't an Olympic sport, 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.839
unless you count rhythmic gymnastics,
which -by the way- I'm pretty good at, 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.839
but no big deal.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.479
Thank You !

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:55.250
Maybe victory dances should be an Olympic 
sport. So after scouring the Youtube

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.010
I've found three victory dances
worthy of a gold medal. 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.010
And the number three victory dance worthy 
of a gold medal, not being somebody's baby-daddy. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
HOST: Andrew, you are not the father.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.010
ANDREW: YEAH ! YEAH !
CROWD: Boooooo!

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.340
CAMERON: This is so tragic. That child is going
to be born and not inherit any of that dude's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.230
sweet dance moves. The take-away here, 
guys, is to really work the crowd. 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.230
I can't stress that enough. 
Work the crowd. 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.230
CROWD: Boooooo !

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.340
So the number two victory 
dance worthy of a gold medal 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.940
would definitely be this dude. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.340
ANNOUNCER: The infamous chicken dance. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.340
CAMERON: Now the key here is to really be in control 
of your body while appearing to be out of control. 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.220
Just be out of control. No one can tell. Seriously.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.520
Number one. Best reason EVER for having a 
victory dance, my personal favorite video.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.670
Now this little clip from ASTRO MONSTER,
which by the way is a super-underrated movie.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.670
After kicking the butt of this giant, three-headed,
crazy, monster-thingy; Godzilla is getting his grove on.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.950
And I gotta say, awesome hang-time 
for this giant radiating dinosaur. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.870
OK, I'm not even going to attempt that dance. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.870
Now that you've seen the best victory dances of
all time, you have to show me your victory dance.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.690
Don't leave me hanging here, guys.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.940
And don't forget to subscribe 
because that would be awesome. 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.330
Check back soon for 
another monster video. Roar.
