the<00:00:20.869> official<00:00:21.869> runescape<00:00:22.500> beta<00:00:23.100> servers<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.150> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
the official runescape beta servers so I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.679 
the official runescape beta servers so I
did<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.630> use<00:00:24.990> o-7<00:00:25.500> scape<00:00:25.800> or<00:00:25.949> live<00:00:26.160> game

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
did not use o-7 scape or live game

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.439 
did not use o-7 scape or live game
basically<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> beta<00:00:28.320> set<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> us<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> can

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
basically in the beta set of us you can

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
basically in the beta set of us you can
duplicate<00:00:30.449> items<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.579> open<00:00:32.579> them

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
duplicate items you can open them

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
duplicate items you can open them
unlimited<00:00:33.570> amounts<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> time<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> stuff<00:00:34.590> like

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
unlimited amounts of time and stuff like

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
unlimited amounts of time and stuff like
that<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> closed<00:00:36.090> beta<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.719> no<00:00:36.960> new

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that it is a closed beta so no new

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
that it is a closed beta so no new
people<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.739> access<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> don't

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
people can access it so if you don't

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.229 
people can access it so if you don't
have<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.510> access<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.170> cannot<00:00:40.469> access<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.460> guess

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
have an access you cannot access I guess

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
have an access you cannot access I guess
yeah<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.200> that's<00:00:43.379> how<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> goes

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
yeah so that's how it goes

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.369 
yeah so that's how it goes
okay<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.210> cleared<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
okay so now that I cleared that out I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.470 
okay so now that I cleared that out I
wanna<00:00:46.590> probably<00:00:47.340> most<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.180> wondering

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
wanna probably most of you are wondering

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
wanna probably most of you are wondering

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
how many Ranger boots that I get because

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
how many Ranger boots that I get because
Ranger<00:00:51.270> boots<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.750> unique<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> level<00:00:52.590> 2<00:00:52.860> clue

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
Ranger boots are unique to level 2 clue

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.340 
Ranger boots are unique to level 2 clue
Scrolls<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:54.420> why<00:00:54.660> they<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.050> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
Scrolls and that's why they are so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.380 
Scrolls and that's why they are so
expensive<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.309> least<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.760> used<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
expensive or at least they used to be so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
expensive or at least they used to be so
expensive<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.500> five<00:00:58.800> times<00:00:59.129> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
expensive I think like five times more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
expensive I think like five times more
than<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.850> Robin<00:01:00.420> hat<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:01.260> because
