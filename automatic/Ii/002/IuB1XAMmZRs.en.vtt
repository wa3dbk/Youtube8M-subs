00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
garbage does the a final I'm saying like

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
garbage does the a final I'm saying like
it's<00:01:17.430> about<00:01:17.600> seeing<00:01:18.600> something<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's about seeing something for what it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's about seeing something for what it
is<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:19.890> being<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.280> producer<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
is and I think being a producer is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
is and I think being a producer is
really<00:01:21.060> training<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.600> ear<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.020> hear<00:01:22.590> what

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
really training your ear to hear what

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
really training your ear to hear what
something<00:01:23.460> actually<00:01:23.700> sounds<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.479> what

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
something actually sounds like and what

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990 
something actually sounds like and what
it<00:01:24.600> sounded<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> other<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> then

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it sounded like to other people and then

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.219 
it sounded like to other people and then
master<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> figure<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:30.229> get

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
about being rooted in a community and

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.960 
about being rooted in a community and
