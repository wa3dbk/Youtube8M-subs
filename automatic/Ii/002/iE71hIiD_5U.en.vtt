it so i put a saucepan lid on it took it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
it so i put a saucepan lid on it took it
off<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> heat<00:01:40.409> i'm<00:01:40.650> waiting<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.130> pasta<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
off the heat i'm waiting for my pasta to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.450 
off the heat i'm waiting for my pasta to
cook<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> point<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.280> kind<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
cook and at that point I was kind of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
cook and at that point I was kind of
nearly<00:01:44.700> bypass<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.360> nearly<00:01:45.509> cooked<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
nearly bypass for nearly cooked and I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.300 
nearly bypass for nearly cooked and I
was<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> thinking<00:01:46.259> well<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.860> should

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
was kind of thinking well I should

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
was kind of thinking well I should
really<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> vegetable<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.450> and

really have in a vegetable here and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.840 
really have in a vegetable here and
rather<00:01:49.619> than<00:01:49.740> having<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> cook<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.460> vegetable

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
