00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
game it is a unique situation because

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.090 
game it is a unique situation because
unlike<00:03:21.540> other<00:03:21.810> games<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.380> doesn't<00:03:22.890> make<00:03:23.040> sense

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
unlike other games it doesn't make sense

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.940 
unlike other games it doesn't make sense
without<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.060> cutscenes<00:03:24.570> there<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.620> cut

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
scenes between pretty much all of the in

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.430 
scenes between pretty much all of the in
gameplay<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.940> try<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.750> show<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
gameplay so if you try to just show the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.060 
gameplay so if you try to just show the
play<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.459> video<00:03:32.730> doesn't<00:03:33.090> make<00:03:33.450> sense<00:03:34.070> so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
play the video doesn't make sense so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.590 
play the video doesn't make sense so
it's<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.280> really<00:03:35.430> big<00:03:35.670> deal<00:03:35.880> for<00:03:35.940> us<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.390> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
it's a really big deal for us because it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.620 
it's a really big deal for us because it
basically<00:03:36.750> means<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.739> can't<00:03:38.070> stream<00:03:38.640> this

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
basically means we can't stream this

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.170 
basically means we can't stream this
game<00:03:40.100> now<00:03:41.100> not<00:03:41.370> sure<00:03:41.400> what<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.790> means<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:42.090> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
game now not sure what it means if you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.750 
game now not sure what it means if you
try<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.390> store<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:43.769> can't<00:03:43.980> show<00:03:44.070> recordings<00:03:44.610> of

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
this game I'm not sure what it means if

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.830 
this game I'm not sure what it means if
you<00:03:47.220> try<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.850> do<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> when<00:03:48.299> it's<00:03:48.420> unmonitored

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
you try to do it when it's unmonitored

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.560 
you try to do it when it's unmonitored
but<00:03:49.650> especially<00:03:49.829> for<00:03:50.180> youtubers<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.239> myself

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
but especially for youtubers like myself

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.690 
but especially for youtubers like myself
it's<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.049> chance<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.530> am<00:03:52.680> not<00:03:52.890> willing<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.340> take

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
it's a chance I am not willing to take

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.960 
it's a chance I am not willing to take
