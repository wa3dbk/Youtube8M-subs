that<00:00:57.329> game<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.870> application<00:01:02.809> we<00:01:03.809> found<00:01:04.049> we

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that game or application we found we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.289 
that game or application we found we
have<00:01:04.290> minimal<00:01:04.799> impact<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> system<00:01:05.640> so

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
have minimal impact on the system so

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
have minimal impact on the system so
when<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.689> renting<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.020> game<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:08.369> have

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
when you're renting your game you have

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.609 
when you're renting your game you have
very<00:01:08.909> small<00:01:09.330> piece<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.930> application

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
very small piece of the application

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
very small piece of the application
actually<00:01:10.939> resident<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.270> machine<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
actually resident on your machine and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.580 
actually resident on your machine and
running<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.310> takes<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.119> virtually<00:01:15.630> no

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
running so it takes up virtually no

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.270 
running so it takes up virtually no
cycles<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.420> memory<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.740> really

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
cycles and very little memory it really

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
cycles and very little memory it really
is<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.970> true<00:01:21.240> marriage<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.900> hardware<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is the true marriage of hardware and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820 
is the true marriage of hardware and
software<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.659> how<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.140> about<00:01:25.290> products

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
software and how we think about products

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460 
software and how we think about products
we<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> build<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> best<00:01:27.780> performing

much extra features and benefits that we

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
much extra features and benefits that we
can<00:01:37.380> bring<00:01:37.590> into<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> gamer<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
can bring into a gamer that can be

can bring into a gamer that can be
realized<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.630> software<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.299> building

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
realized through software and building

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.749 
realized through software and building
these<00:01:42.479> SteelSeries<00:01:43.049> Engine<00:01:43.320> 3<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.130> than

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
these SteelSeries Engine 3 was more than

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.469 
these SteelSeries Engine 3 was more than
just<00:01:45.360> building<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.320> software<00:01:46.979> suite<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.759> Mac

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just building a software suite for Mac

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.560 
just building a software suite for Mac
OS<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.079> software<00:01:49.680> suite<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.579> Windows<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.450> was

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
OS a software suite for Windows it was

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.330 
OS a software suite for Windows it was
about<00:01:51.720> building<00:01:51.899> an<00:01:52.140> ecosystem<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.070> about

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
about building an ecosystem and about

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830 
about building an ecosystem and about
thinking<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.240> our<00:01:54.329> products<00:01:54.750> from

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
thinking about all of our products from

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
thinking about all of our products from
the<00:01:54.990> ground<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:56.490> changes<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the ground up and what changes that a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.440 
the ground up and what changes that a
gamer<00:01:58.320> might<00:01:58.560> never<00:01:58.770> notice<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
gamer might never notice would make a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.480 
gamer might never notice would make a
slightly<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.560> reliable

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.470 

so<00:02:10.390> for<00:02:10.570> our<00:02:10.660> headsets<00:02:11.080> we<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.670> very<00:02:13.330> rich

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
so for our headsets we have a very rich

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
so for our headsets we have a very rich
configuration<00:02:14.230> environment<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
configuration environment in the

the ability to do per application

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.610 
the ability to do per application
