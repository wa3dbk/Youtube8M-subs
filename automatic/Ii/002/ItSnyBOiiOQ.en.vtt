00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.790
 We will work with the 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.790
 Life program 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.030
 we will make a sum of three numbers using 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.029
 the algorithm adds up and using the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.130
 comedy program chief now I 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.810
 flow first 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.810
 we read the numbers 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 these numbers will be a as b as c 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.890
 then we go to the process of signing 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.359
 here we have it 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.359
 the sum we are going to call 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.020
 zuma that will be equal to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.760
 + b 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.280
 we accept 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.760
 and now let's go an exit without 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 message 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.900
 and here in the output we are going to write 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 zuma 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 we accept 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.870
 we already have the complete program we are going to 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.830
 try out 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:33.120
 value enter a number 4 next the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:36.080
 number 7 next number 9 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.080
 20 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.420
 but the term 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.450
 The advantage of this process is that it is 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.810
 working as a calculator we do not have 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.780
 messages 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 then there is no difference between 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.310
 a programmable calculator and a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.200
 Computer program 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.110
 then we are going to change the program 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.030
 to create a friendlier menu that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.990
 we can understand or that another person 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.790
 can you understand 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.790
 let's rewrite let's erase 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.849
 recording this program science program 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.450
 and began to see again we will put a 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.450
 message here 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.620
 always with quotes 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.260
 our message will be 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.260
 we will add 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.140
 whole numbers close quotes 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.349
 and we accept 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.650
 this is not going to just seem like a 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.030
 message 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.030
 then I entered another message 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.650
 we will send you the message of 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.400
 enter 3 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.400
 numbers 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.410
 we close 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.240
 enter three numbers 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.630
 now let's go to a reading we're going to 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.200
 read them let's read the three numbers 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.200
 we will read 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.849
 and we are going to see the numbers to rubber of comma 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.500
 now we go to the process of adding it 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.500
 then we take the assignment picture 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:07.069
 and here the sum we will call sum or 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:11.629
 capitalized and it will be equal to 9 base 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.999
 we accept now we just need to present 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.999
 the results we choose an output 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.530
 but we are going to include a message on 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.160
 message will be quotes 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.490
 the sum of 3 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.080
 numbers 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.930
 we leave them a space close eat 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.139
 coma 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.350
 zuma which is the variable that produces us 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.729
 the sum we accept we have the program 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.509
 complete but with messages 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.509
 we're going to try it 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.590
 the menu tells me we will add three numbers 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.080
 integers we continue enter three 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.569
 numbers 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:09.599
 the first number 5 we continue 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.599
 it's a number 7 we follow 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.380
 12 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.630
 we continue the sum of the three numbers 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.500
 is 24 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.500
 we continue 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.460
 we can make a new test 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.800
 and three whole numbers 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.400
 introduce three numbers we will put in 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 large numbers 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.800
 first number 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.990
 second number 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:57.509
 does not say the sum the three numbers is 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.610
 4 million 98 thousand 646 the program 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.610
 It works and it's friendly
