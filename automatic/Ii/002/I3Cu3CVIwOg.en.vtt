00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
really doesn't take long to arrest them

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.020 
really doesn't take long to arrest them
and<00:03:26.480> take<00:03:26.540> very<00:03:26.870> long<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.170> cook<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.819> have<00:03:29.000> a
