00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
 What is the art 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.410
 [Music] 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.970
 it's true there are many people who 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 throughout his life will not arise in 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.580
 no moment of this question and there will be 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.580
 others that simply detect art 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.470
 we live in a world where art is 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.540
 essential where the limits are the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.100
 edges of each blank sheet where the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.450
 canvases are worlds to discover and in 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.800
 universal areas and themes 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.720
 we live in a world full of artists 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.460
 art plan allows us to cope 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 the worst moments and enjoy the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.809
 top 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.809
 we live in a world that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.230
 they are killing the art 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420
 but it is tearing for each of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 their targets mutilating with absurd laws 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.740
 with measures that neither the artists themselves 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.530
 could have ever imagined 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.780
 the art is dying 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.969
 the art was dying 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.990
 it's not that the current policy is 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.880
 doing too much to save it 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.310
 and hardly see people saying to their 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.680
 children that being an artist is the worst thing 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.600
 you can consider yourself to be in this life that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.820
 better go to the university to study 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.860
 a career and get a degree in 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.200
 quantum physicist molecular researcher 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.640
 mathematician or any other career that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 promote skepticism and 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.850
 rationalism 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.520
 in a world that has very little 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.420
 skeptical 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.420
 much biological 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.829
 society has taken as concept of 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.540
 correct everything that was inside 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.210
 of established stereotypes 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.010
 [Music] 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.310
 where the artist and his art were left 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.310
 outside 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.730
 how many artists have died for their art 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.840
 how many more artists will have to die 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.840
 to save the art 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.110
 we live in a world where governments 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.300
 promote world peace with armies 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.830
 where politicians try to sell us 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.830
 the image of identity protection 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.730
 cultural raising the artistic vat up 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.730
 21% 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.070
 so tell me what it is for you to be an artist 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.740
 what is to throw you 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.990
 [Music] 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.000
 I would say that for me art is a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.860
 form of expression a way of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.160
 rebel against social dictates 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.250
 a way of life beauty in itself and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 I suppose something unique and essential who 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.460
 he gives it in human lives for me the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.610
 art is any creative work done 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.590
 just for the sake of doing it for me 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.480
 art is a way of seeing the world is 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.210
 get out of white or black and create a 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.340
 endless tonalities the art is governed 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.000
 by imagination and has no limits 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.050
 that's why I think it's somehow 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.050
 synonym of freedom 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.310
 I think of a world where the only 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.450
 wars have reversed where the culture 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.670
 it becomes a right 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.260
 and he was just being a character of 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.580
 fiction 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.020
 [Music] 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.390
 where the logic behind tinelli 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.110
 rationalism where you can believe in the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.110
 art and in oneself 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.760
 I think of a world that is moved by 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.060
 the feelings and not for the money and the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.060
 power 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.970
 world 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.800
 where being an artist is considered as 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.740
 a profession of great value and respect 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.550
 where you can love art and nobody is 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.360
 forced to study it 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.030
 I think 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.350
 where young people dare to 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.120
 be artists and travel back what they will say 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.970
 [Music] 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.720
 I think about 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.510
 where art is more alive than ever and 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.780
 where politics defends him with nails and 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.290
 teeth because that day of the world without 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.590
 the art 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.769
 [Music] 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.940
 you can die of hunger but you can not 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.940
 can live without art 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.410
 the artists will continue to be 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.220
 starved dead ones trampled 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.410
 misunderstood and mutilated scams 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.410
 but we will be living as they do not 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.150
 no other person in the world 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.610
 enjoying life 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.000
 loving our work and working what 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.000
 that we love 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.800
 Oscar Wilde once said art is not 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.610
 something that can be taken and left is 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.610
 necessary to live 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.210
 without the art 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.980
 life would be a mistake 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.740
 klÃ©ber and clichÃ© 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.990
 so tell me what art is 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.610
 in the same way that only a physicist can 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.310
 quantum explain to you the structure of a 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.139
 atom only the artists will be able 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.139
 answer what art is
