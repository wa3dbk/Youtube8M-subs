00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
in there snow the first thing you want

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900 
in there snow the first thing you want
to<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> pull<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.489> dasher<00:00:35.880> rod

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
to do is you want to pull the dasher rod

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
to do is you want to pull the dasher rod
in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> mixing<00:00:36.719> wheel<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
in the mixing wheel all the way to the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.180 
in the mixing wheel all the way to the
top<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> cartridge<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:40.800> take<00:00:41.040> your

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
top of the cartridge and then take your

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.479 
top of the cartridge and then take your
ramrod<00:00:42.410> insert<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> National<00:00:44.309> rod

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
ramrod insert it into the National rod

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.540 
ramrod insert it into the National rod
and<00:00:45.559> you're<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> put<00:00:46.920> pressure<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.399> this

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and you're going to put pressure on this

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.279 
and you're going to put pressure on this
piston<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.420> open<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> valve<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
piston which will open the valve at the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
piston which will open the valve at the
bottom<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> dasher<00:00:50.219> rod<00:00:50.420> allowing<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
bottom of the dasher rod allowing the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.049 
bottom of the dasher rod allowing the
catalyst<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.760> base<00:00:53.940> material

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.540 

sometimes<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> takes<00:00:57.420> quite<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.719> bit<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.989> force

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
sometimes it takes quite a bit of force

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
sometimes it takes quite a bit of force
to<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.910> piston<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.629> move<00:01:00.660> initially<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
to get that piston to move initially you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.960 
to get that piston to move initially you
may<00:01:01.949> actually<00:01:02.280> hit<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.760> piston

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
may actually hit it to get that piston

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.080 
may actually hit it to get that piston
moving<00:01:07.460> for<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> best<00:01:08.729> results<00:01:09.330> move<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
moving for the best results move the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.969 
moving for the best results move the
dasher<00:01:12.090> rod<00:01:12.260> down<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.500> bit<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> can

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
dasher rod down a little bit so you can

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
dasher rod down a little bit so you can
spread<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> catalyst<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.729> inside<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.479> base

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
spread the catalyst out inside the base

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.539 
spread the catalyst out inside the base
material<00:01:20.000> once<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> way

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
material once you have it all the way

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
material once you have it all the way
all<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> catalysts<00:01:24.299> into<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> base<00:01:25.409> material

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
all the catalysts into the base material

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
all the catalysts into the base material
you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.159> route<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> dasher<00:01:26.820> rod

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you can route the dasher rod

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.550 
you can route the dasher rod
I<00:01:27.270> mean<00:01:27.689> remove<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> base<00:01:28.610> ramrod<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.560> then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I mean remove the base ramrod and then

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.990 
I mean remove the base ramrod and then
start<00:01:31.950> mixing<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> dasher<00:01:34.770> rod<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
start mixing with the dasher rod in a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.679 
start mixing with the dasher rod in a
clockwise<00:01:36.479> motion<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.540> move<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
clockwise motion you want to move the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
clockwise motion you want to move the
mixing<00:01:43.020> wheel<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.070> cartridge

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
mixing wheel up and down the cartridge

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.960 
mixing wheel up and down the cartridge
as<00:01:45.079> you<00:01:46.079> continue<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> mix<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.670> clockwise

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
as you continue to mix in a clockwise

00:01:47.970 --> 00:02:04.330 
as you continue to mix in a clockwise
motion

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.219 

in<00:02:04.790> most<00:02:05.119> materials<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.720> may<00:02:05.869> have<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.200> mix

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
in most materials you may have to mix

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.080 
in most materials you may have to mix

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
75 strokes up and down to get a ticket

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.759 
75 strokes up and down to get a ticket
of<00:02:16.880> thorough<00:02:17.090> mix<00:02:20.230> once<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.349> believe<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
of thorough mix once you believe that

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.320 
of thorough mix once you believe that
the<00:02:21.860> material<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.430> mixed<00:02:22.819> inside<00:02:23.000> the

unscrew the dasher rod one thing I want

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.740 
unscrew the dasher rod one thing I want
to<00:02:45.799> mention<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:46.880> you're<00:02:47.060> mixing<00:02:47.420> the
