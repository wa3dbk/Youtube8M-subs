00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.540
 it is fantastic 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.750
 has overcome the South Korean race 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:49.360
 stays against ochsenhausen so he 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:01:02.440
 they are lost to others outside 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:01:04.860
 easier mistakes allowed ochsenhausen 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:12.130
 sets another exclamation point 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:16.740
 Absolutely the case is what makes the juwi 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.740
 do not let it all further 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:46.250
 men of course so this must be 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:52.780
 win against rio win gigantic thing 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.680
 if they were here today 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.570
 can not be worse and that 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.890
 funny but previously said 20 80 large 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.890
 Do not chance against them 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:05.470
 very close third rate 78 has never been 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:11.440
 back against ryu carry on media 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:39.910
 third sentence without superlatives before hand 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:48.030
 of the player and thus for the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:48.030
 South Koreans again next medium 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.580
 that was the big chance to attack 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.580
 Japan 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.670
 but as is often the case first 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.270
 2 1 to lead 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:37.300
 The chance is that I am not someone 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:57.100
 after this setback of rios around the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:58.870
 was with four to four in number four 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.069
 equal to all the crucial fifth 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:14.699
 give match 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:16.530
 after trashing against rio so that 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.590
 schwabenderby against all that 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.569
 crucial fifth single good level 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.569
 remains unbeaten
