00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.330
 hi girls today with this video i have 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.960
 intend to usher in a series of 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.200
 videos that are dedicated to care e 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.240
 to the beauty of our face because a 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.480
 part that many have asked me 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.250
 also on facebook if I could do some 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.039
 video on in the remedies for oily skin 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.090
 or if home according to yours 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.740
 needs 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.199
 it is a quantum because they had told us 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.120
 in the video on the motion to do 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:39.760
 become our longest eyelashes 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.860
 the stronger it is logical that if we have a 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.050
 raw material therefore in this case the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.969
 beautiful skin and then it will be easier too 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.760
 look for formats that look good 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.579
 without resorting to dyes which he then does 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.989
 perfect mask that can in short that 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.420
 they don't hold because we have the skin 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.629
 too fat or too dry 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.899
 and therefore do not make here if we already have 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:08.259
 a beautiful skin of ours we can stand 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.020
 quiet and safe that really also 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.830
 the cosmetics will also really make it 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.039
 so much more then I would have this 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.899
 intention if you like put me 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.380
 like under this video so i am but 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.810
 I understand if the idea excites me 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.520
 I really have to say then 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 Let's start with the first video I have 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.430
 decided to dedicate to a mask for 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.670
 cleanse oily skin I tell you 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.250
 immediately for the application you have to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.179
 put it on the face to let it act approximately 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.670
 10 minutes anyway until you hear 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.439
 in short, that the mask has dried up and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.560
 you realize it because the skin is pulling 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.140
 really managed to move a muscle 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.880
 at that point our skin is ready to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.530
 mask made his affection you don't have to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.170
 do anything other than rinse with a 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 nice bit of hot water until you are 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.789
 I recommend completely removed 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.950
 suggestion then for at least a couple 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.519
 of hours try to leave the peace alone 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.140
 in short, our skin doesn't wear make-up 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.239
 leave it alone because it is a 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.120
 nice treatment than by its effects 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.579
 but I try and maybe a little stressful 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.049
 so here, besides, don't do it 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.390
 however more than once a week 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.380
 here is not necessary all moms 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.030
 days 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.709
 so I told you everything and we move on 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.709
 immediately to the list of ingredients 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.819
 here we are as you saw the list 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.349
 of the ingredients is really simple and 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.349
 very short 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.920
 I tell you the replacements right away 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.800
 white has its own purifying power 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.480
 antibacterial and is substantially 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.129
 this along with the ever zena he gives you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.349
 the effect you are looking for 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.690
 but if you really can't find it 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.200
 I tell you that I have this bought here 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.569
 I'm mason really comes at a price 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.060
 derisory though if you can't find it you can 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.660
 replace the quantities that would be of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.319
 white clay with maizena here 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.630
 why he didn't know this is here 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.690
 as you can see it is written in German because 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.549
 I bought it here in Switzerland but there 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.680
 they sell it with certainty also in 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.500
 italy look for it in the flour department 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.260
 sweets etc. in supermarkets la 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.079
 found with the name maizena or with the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.069
 name corn starch so you can't 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.079
 make a mistake 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.299
 in that case replace the sum you put 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.250
 all half-whole or all starch of 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.530
 corn and in short 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.109
 so what we need 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.209
 not important if you use clay 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.209
 need the same care with the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.660
 maizena bench the clay yes not used 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.660
 metal as I had already said for henna 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.989
 avoid any metal then go 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.510
 to work in this case I use 2 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.310
 plastic teaspoons is a small glass 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.200
 made of glass and you can also use the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.419
 small plastic cup a small bowl 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 in short, everything you want 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.380
 the important thing is that there are no parties 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.950
 metal that come into contact with 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.669
 the clay 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.690
 so let's start with the clay right away 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.150
 white 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.720
 the recipe, as we said, is two 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.720
 tsp 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.380
 once we put the clay and we will use 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.030
 this spoon with which we have 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.370
 touched the clay to mix the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.770
 all so that food ingredients 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.990
 they don't come into contact we'll use another 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:42.720
 teaspoon with which I take a 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:46.020
 teaspoon of cornstarch at this point 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:51.390
 after a first mixing so that the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:54.080
 powders join at this point step 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.080
 with honey 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.410
 I begin to mix, of course we will see 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.300
 that the honey will not be able to melt 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.570
 in all these powders 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.660
 but in the meantime try to spend it a little 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.250
 I immediately add a teaspoon of 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.500
 lemon juice 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.650
 I have this here but you can squeeze one 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.520
 lemon aside and then to fill the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.520
 your teaspoon 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.910
 let us mix at this point as you can 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.130
 easily see we do not have 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.990
 absolutely nothing easily 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.720
 spreadable on the face 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.960
 that's why I told you to add 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.600
 water and I also said how much water 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.090
 need because you have to watch out then 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:58.820
 hot water that definitely helps you and 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:00.830
 reach slowly so we mix 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.729
 as you can see it changes the whole 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.729
 consistency 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.820
 I really recommend water a little 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.380
 very little or less than a 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:19.760
 teaspoon for which we already have lemon 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:22.910
 that the liquid and here it is for ours 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:27.250
 cream is ready for ours to make from 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:31.100
 mask as you see you see how it goes down 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.510
 so in blocks because it doesn't have to be 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.400
 obviously it doesn't have to be too much 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.680
 liquid because otherwise it doesn't stay there 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.350
 on the face and I recommend it when the 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.360
 lay down just one layer is why 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.340
 otherwise it never really dries you up 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.310
 hold it for half an hour 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.690
 so here's how you really see it 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.430
 really simple it really does in a 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.039
 I have already told you the replacements 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.380
 and really the cheapest thing and more 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:57.270
 natural that can happen to me 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.420
 try it on themes as you are 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.580
 if you like it I recommend to remember 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.320
 subscribe to the channel put me like me 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.040
 I remember it under this video 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.840
 if you like the idea of ​​these masks 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.950
 for the face, in short , I will do it 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.190
 also others 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.190
 see you at the next hello video
