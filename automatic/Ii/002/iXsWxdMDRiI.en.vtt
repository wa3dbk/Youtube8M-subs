some acrylic glue stick them on top of
each<00:01:50.250> other<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.659> late<00:01:51.930> try<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.409> about

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
each other and then late try for about

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.300 
each other and then late try for about
10<00:01:52.920> minutes<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.600> used<00:01:55.439> three<00:01:56.009> layers

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
10 minutes or so and I used three layers

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
10 minutes or so and I used three layers
on<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.880> mum's<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.079> recommend<00:01:58.469> using<00:01:58.619> three

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
on my mum's and I recommend using three

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.609 
on my mum's and I recommend using three
not<00:01:59.369> two<00:01:59.399> because<00:02:00.090> when<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:00.899> dad<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.200> cutting

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
not two because when my dad was cutting

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.399 
not two because when my dad was cutting
it<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:02.210> as<00:02:03.210> well<00:02:03.630> there's<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> template<00:02:04.229> of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
it in as well there's a template of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.530 
it in as well there's a template of
two-year<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.820> very<00:02:06.000> thick<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:06.420> only

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
two-year it's not very thick it's only

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.199 
two-year it's not very thick it's only
10<00:02:06.899> mil<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.200> together<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.190> use<00:02:08.399> 15<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:09.030> my

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
10 mil all together as I use 15 on my

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.900 
10 mil all together as I use 15 on my
mouse<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.709> cotton<00:02:10.950> eat<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
mouse and when it was cotton eat it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.790 
mouse and when it was cotton eat it
him<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> thickness<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.530> wasn't

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
him it with the thickness it wasn't

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
him it with the thickness it wasn't
thick<00:02:13.950> enough<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:15.120> helmet<00:02:15.450> he<00:02:15.600> would

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
thick enough for the helmet he would

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.000 
thick enough for the helmet he would
have<00:02:15.810> started<00:02:16.050> coming<00:02:16.380> for<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.650> other<00:02:16.800> side

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
have started coming for the other side

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.820 
have started coming for the other side
so<00:02:17.790> I'm<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.360> said<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.630> recommend<00:02:19.230> using<00:02:19.440> three

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
so I'm like said I recommend using three

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.310 
so I'm like said I recommend using three
in<00:02:20.900> three<00:02:21.900> layers<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.290> acrylic<00:02:23.990> knife<00:02:24.990> or<00:02:25.140> step

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
in three layers of acrylic knife or step

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.790 
in three layers of acrylic knife or step
three

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
three

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.250 
three

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and once it's dried and you'll get some

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.260 
and once it's dried and you'll get some
layers<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.880> what<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.120> want
