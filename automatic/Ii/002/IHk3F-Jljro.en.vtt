00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.469

 come by week the master will start at 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.240
 intensify work in this channel in 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.260
 this video we will talk about small 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.300
 changes that have appeared so 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.980
 wild in the baby one of the most 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 remarkable is the intro animation of the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.210
 very powerful rumba the super galactic 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.160
 that not only has a super animation 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.930
 great but also comes with a 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.879
 sonic style music the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.070
 porcupine tell me you are 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.530
 will buy this is who the truth is that 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.479
 Although the mona monkey dressed in silk 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.100
 it stays with that I mean that they break in 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.260
 its moments is not exactly a 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.659
 champion that shine for its mechanics or 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
 efficiency being of the champions more 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.710
 forgotten in the league and not because it's ugly 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.030
 but because there are more viable champions 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.010
 I hope you get a revised 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.739
 soon a new one also appears 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.930
 fist sentinel is to say with the logo 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.250
 of riot is currently priceless and if 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.350
 do not know how you can 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.900
 get this nice guard there are some 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.790
 tentative changes in champions in bp the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.740
 heimerdinger's turret will now have more 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.570
 life but its attacks both lightning and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.850
 the cannon will cause less damage 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.950
 the skill with the lyrics has some 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.200
 changes the school will last 6 seconds and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 15 as now the damage it causes will be 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.580
 Reduced also can only be used in 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.710
 champions revenge a reduction of 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.200
 range of 100 units in your letter and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.690
 boleadoras and its ultimate will give you now 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.670
 5% less movement speed 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.500
 the crushing blow of bu with haora no 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.420
 will reduce so much armor in the first 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
 levels and your ultimate will now make a 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 less damage is done by the base of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.520
 sex was restored to 390 out of 350 and the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.680
 basic attack range was reduced by 25 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.600
 units this because it follows is very 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.220
 annoyed with those auto attacks and by 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.810
 last many were unhappy with 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.180
 the last changes that were seen in pd 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.399
 for our good baker pantheon and today 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.920
 certain aspects that were made are restored 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.509
 that we will hit the scream in the sky 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 panel study of a volley last a 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.600
 second on all levels 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.430
 they increased the range of the ultimate that 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.180
 it was what had bothered many 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.100
 players 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.320
 previously remember that precisely 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.600
 for this is the pp to test changes and 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.340
 see how viable many of them can be 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.290
 what many of the things that they listen to 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.780
 here they probably do not see the light or 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.780
 Maybe if everything is part of a process 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.520
 of dance 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.110
 we arrived in space saving their 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.900
 questions appear and smell like 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.060
 pajarillos rubén villalba asks what 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.709
 criteria take riot to get new 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.660
 game modes like ex here not one 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.340
 against one etc. so it does some 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.140
 riot time spoke that these modes of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.150
 game are to maintain freshness and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.010
 innovation but I think they do not see them as 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.110
 definitive game modes simply 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.930
 they see them as a fun time a 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.280
 greeting iván maidana asks if I steal 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.860
 the master would be interested in forming 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.870
 part of a professional team would be a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
 nice experience the truth is that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.230

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.120

 decent player but practice up
