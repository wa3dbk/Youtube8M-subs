00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
I kind of crossed this fuzzy line where

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.770 
I kind of crossed this fuzzy line where
I'm<00:02:09.290> having<00:02:09.740> him<00:02:10.130> work<00:02:10.580> here<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.360> probably<00:02:11.570> a

I'm having him work here it's probably a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.729 
I'm having him work here it's probably a
bad<00:02:11.959> idea<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.800> I'm<00:02:13.700> gonna<00:02:14.000> do<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.300> anyway

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.979 

it's<00:02:20.739> heartbreaking<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.790> me<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.450> see<00:02:22.690> other

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
it's heartbreaking to me to see other

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.619 
it's heartbreaking to me to see other
people<00:02:23.530> choosing<00:02:24.519> other<00:02:24.790> restaurants<00:02:25.510> around

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
people choosing other restaurants around

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.940 
people choosing other restaurants around
here<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.970> struggle<00:02:27.970> with<00:02:28.379> why<00:02:29.379> it's<00:02:29.680> not

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
here and struggle with why it's not

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.330 
here and struggle with why it's not
busier<00:02:30.400> than<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.819> is<00:02:31.290> if<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.680> Lido<00:02:32.950> doesn't

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
busier than it is if the Lido doesn't

be<00:02:36.220> open<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.720> beginning<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.319> next

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
be open in to the beginning of the next

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.400 
be open in to the beginning of the next
year<00:02:38.670> I've<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:40.030> been<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.450> frustrated<00:02:40.660> I'm

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
year I've just been so frustrated I'm

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.470 
year I've just been so frustrated I'm
barely<00:02:42.220> making<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:43.030> by<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:45.190> can't<00:02:46.000> continue

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
barely making it by and I can't continue

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.319 
barely making it by and I can't continue
on<00:02:46.660> like<00:02:47.079> this
