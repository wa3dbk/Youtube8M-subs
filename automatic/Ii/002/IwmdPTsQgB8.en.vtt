00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
this swivels on this when I first got it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.929 
this swivels on this when I first got it
it<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.700> real<00:01:57.329> stiff<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> basically<00:01:58.909> when<00:01:59.909> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it was real stiff and basically when it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.880 
it was real stiff and basically when it
would<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> turn<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.290> would<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.770> would

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
would go to turn it would just it would

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580 
would go to turn it would just it would
unscrew<00:02:02.729> itself<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> lens<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.439> had<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
unscrew itself from the lens so I had to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
unscrew itself from the lens so I had to
take<00:02:04.799> take<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.280> apart<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.759> they<00:02:06.299> had<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> little

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
take take it apart and they had a little

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.330 
take take it apart and they had a little
bit<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> extra<00:02:07.110> plastic<00:02:07.649> from<00:02:08.069> where<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.250> was

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bit of extra plastic from where it was

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.669 
bit of extra plastic from where it was
molded<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.590> had

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
molded that was in there that I just had

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.700 
molded that was in there that I just had
to<00:02:10.770> file<00:02:10.979> away

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
to file away

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.770 
to file away
it<00:02:12.010> works<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:12.820> smoother<00:02:13.270> now<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.540> where

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it works a little smoother now to where

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.150 
it works a little smoother now to where
it<00:02:13.840> doesn't<00:02:14.020> want<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.350> unscrew<00:02:14.830> from<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
it doesn't want to unscrew from the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.410 
it doesn't want to unscrew from the
front<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.460> lens<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.330> a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
front of the lens and it's just a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.870 
front of the lens and it's just a

straight cord some of them have the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
to figure out why this can go up and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.010 
to figure out why this can go up and
down<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> back<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.480> has<00:02:49.780> your

down because on the back it has your

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.150 
down because on the back it has your
degrees<00:02:51.000> labeled<00:02:52.000> up<00:02:52.120> here<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:53.530> no<00:02:53.860> idea

what<00:02:54.280> that's<00:02:54.400> for

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
what that's for

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.860 
what that's for
maybe<00:02:57.460> if<00:02:57.580> someone<00:02:57.790> else<00:02:57.940> knows<00:02:58.210> Nico<00:02:58.630> let<00:02:58.780> me

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.960 
maybe if someone else knows Nico let me
know<00:02:59.220> only<00:03:00.220> thing<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.580> think<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:00.940> that

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.880 
noticed that it looked in there you
could<00:04:35.750> see<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.230> was<00:04:36.350> shifted<00:04:36.710> back<00:04:36.830> a

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
could see that it was shifted back a

could see that it was shifted back a
little<00:04:37.190> bit<00:04:37.430> on<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.790> camera<00:04:38.120> body<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:40.510> just

Manfrotto 0:55 whatever the rest of all
number<00:05:36.350> is<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:41.290> reason<00:05:42.290> why<00:05:42.410> one<00:05:42.560> would<00:05:42.650> this

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
number is so reason why one would this

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.140 
number is so reason why one would this
was<00:05:43.280> mainly<00:05:44.000> because<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:45.680> price<00:05:45.890> was<00:05:46.150> decent

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
was mainly because the price was decent

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.690 
was mainly because the price was decent
and<00:05:47.300> I<00:05:47.900> was<00:05:48.650> thinking<00:05:49.040> that<00:05:49.070> the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
and I was thinking that the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.550 
and I was thinking that the
quick-release<00:05:50.210> plate<00:05:50.450> would<00:05:50.960> work<00:05:51.169> on<00:05:51.380> the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
quick-release plate would work on the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.620 
quick-release plate would work on the
other<00:05:52.010> tripod<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.669> ahead<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.300> was<00:05:53.419> just<00:05:53.540> a

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
other tripod that ahead it was just a

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.680 
other tripod that ahead it was just a
Walmart<00:05:53.990> twenty<00:05:54.680> dollar<00:05:54.860> special<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:56.630> I

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
Walmart twenty dollar special and I

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.780 
Walmart twenty dollar special and I
figured<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.200> the<00:05:57.380> cord<00:05:57.710> Alicia<00:05:57.950> plate<00:05:58.190> for

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
figured that the cord Alicia plate for

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.030 
figured that the cord Alicia plate for
the<00:05:59.240> pistol<00:05:59.600> grip<00:05:59.630> would<00:05:59.930> work<00:06:00.140> with<00:06:00.620> that<00:06:00.650> so

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
the pistol grip would work with that so

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.290 
the pistol grip would work with that so
I<00:06:01.100> wouldn't<00:06:01.280> have<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.520> keep<00:06:01.640> switching<00:06:01.880> those

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
I wouldn't have to keep switching those

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.590 
I wouldn't have to keep switching those
but<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:03.440> it<00:06:03.770> being<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.010> same<00:06:04.040> but<00:06:04.250> it<00:06:05.150> came<00:06:05.360> in

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
but and it being the same but it came in

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.790 
but and it being the same but it came in
I<00:06:06.200> pretty<00:06:07.190> much<00:06:07.250> like<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.850> truck<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:09.020> pistol

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
I pretty much like the truck the pistol

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.310 
I pretty much like the truck the pistol
grip<00:06:09.830> so<00:06:10.160> far<00:06:10.400> so<00:06:10.700> I<00:06:10.729> decided<00:06:11.390> to<00:06:11.660> get<00:06:11.930> second

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
grip so far so I decided to get second

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.490 
grip so far so I decided to get second
