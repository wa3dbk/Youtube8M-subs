00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 immediately by what by the agreements 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.099
 the agreements there are four 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 so we will not be exactly the case 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 were original like that will simplify 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.739
 a little bit of finger placement 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.739
