middle and those little round circles

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
middle and those little round circles
are<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> exact<00:00:40.079> size<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:41.219> esophagus<00:00:41.640> and

are the exact size of your esophagus and
easily<00:00:42.840> rock<00:00:43.290> off<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> airway<00:00:44.010> okay<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
easily rock off the airway okay so I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.310 
easily rock off the airway okay so I
thought<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.690> wow<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> need<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
cutting it that Wes and there's got to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
cutting it that Wes and there's got to
be<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> quicker<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
be a quicker way to do this and so I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
be a quicker way to do this and so I
asked<00:00:56.910> my<00:00:57.000> wife<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> pick<00:00:57.750> us<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.079> hot<00:00:58.230> dog

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
slice when you go to the store couldn't

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.459 
slice when you go to the store couldn't
find<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.149> looked<00:01:00.570> searched<00:01:00.809> online<00:01:00.989> couldn't

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469

find one looked searched online couldn't
find<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> made<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.280> how<00:01:02.910> did<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.180> make

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
find one so I made one how did you make

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
find one so I made one how did you make
the<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.290> well<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:05.040> drew<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the first one well I actually drew the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
the first one well I actually drew the
idea<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.450> sketch<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> piece<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> paper<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
idea on a sketch a piece of paper and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
idea on a sketch a piece of paper and
then<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> took<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:08.820> engineers<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
then I took it to some engineers and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
then I took it to some engineers and
about<00:01:10.140> 12<00:01:10.530> prototypes<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> four<00:01:11.640> years<00:01:11.880> later

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
about 12 prototypes and four years later

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
about 12 prototypes and four years later
we<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> took<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
we have it so that's how you took it to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.350 
we have it so that's how you took it to
market<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.520> yeah<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.939> lot<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.119> people

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
market so yeah I think a lot of people

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.490 
market so yeah I think a lot of people
are<00:01:15.450> intrigued<00:01:15.720> by<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.409> all

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
are intrigued by that because we all

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
are intrigued by that because we all
