what<00:00:29.730> was<00:00:29.849> interesting<00:00:30.089> with<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.480> much<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.810> do

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
what was interesting with so much to do

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.420 
what was interesting with so much to do
at<00:00:30.960> sync<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.380> instance<00:00:31.650> he<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.220> actually

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
at sync for instance he was actually

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.370 
at sync for instance he was actually
using<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.669> belly<00:00:32.880> putter<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
using a belly putter and I think at the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.910 
using a belly putter and I think at the
time<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.740> out<00:00:34.890> outside<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.640> top<00:00:36.360> 100<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
time was out outside the top 100 of the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.770 
time was out outside the top 100 of the
place<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.520> cuttings<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.030> set<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.600> went

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
place the cuttings that I set it went

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
place the cuttings that I set it went
over<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> standard<00:00:40.620> method<00:00:41.100> putter<00:00:41.430> like

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
over to a standard method putter like

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
over to a standard method putter like
this<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.300> before<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> he's

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this one and before you know it he's

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.799 
this one and before you know it he's
winning<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> open<00:00:44.699> main<00:00:44.940> parking<00:00:45.539> stats

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
winning on the open main parking stats

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
winning on the open main parking stats
are<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.140> fantastic<00:00:46.309> Casey<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.940> was

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
are actually fantastic Casey I think was

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.849 
are actually fantastic Casey I think was
the<00:00:48.059> first<00:00:48.149> person<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> win<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.410> using<00:00:49.739> on

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
the first person to win with using on

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.220 
the first person to win with using on
these<00:00:50.070> method<00:00:50.670> putters<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> he's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.509 
these method putters as well and he's
betting<00:00:52.469> stats<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.010> went<00:00:53.160> through<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
betting stats just went through the

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.220 
betting stats just went through the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
been able to do move that weight into

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.380 
been able to do move that weight into
the<00:01:12.360> heel<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> toe<00:01:13.040> okay<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> moving<00:01:15.300> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
weight to the heel the heel on the toe

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.680 
weight to the heel the heel on the toe
okay<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.120> is<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.300> will<00:01:18.360> fill

okay and then what we do is we will fill

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.880 
okay and then what we do is we will fill
that<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.930> polymer<00:01:19.320> that's<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:19.710> black

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that with polymer that's what that black

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.610 
that with polymer that's what that black
line<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.520> okay<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.300> polymer<00:01:21.690> then<00:01:22.560> we

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
line is there okay it's polymer then we

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.160 
line is there okay it's polymer then we
come<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> face<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.630> I'm<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:24.780> mill

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
come to the face here I'm actually mill

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
come to the face here I'm actually mill
into<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:26.010> into<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.370> face<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.940> cut<00:01:27.150> away<00:01:27.300> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
into it into the face and cut away and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
into it into the face and cut away and
so<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.290> polymer<00:01:28.620> thing<00:01:28.860> comes<00:01:29.100> through<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so that polymer thing comes through so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
so that polymer thing comes through so
what<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.120> is<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.870> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
what you have here is you have a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
what you have here is you have a
combination<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:33.080> polymer<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.250> metal<00:01:35.250> okay

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
combination of of polymer and metal okay

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.750 
combination of of polymer and metal okay
yeah<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.660> you<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:37.080> a<00:01:37.260> nice<00:01:37.650> soft<00:01:37.950> feel<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
yeah so you get a nice soft feel off the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.070 
yeah so you get a nice soft feel off the
face<00:01:38.940> because<00:01:39.210> you've<00:01:39.300> got<00:01:39.390> polymer<00:01:39.720> behind

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
face because you've got polymer behind

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.780 
face because you've got polymer behind
there<00:01:40.320> okay<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.280> still<00:01:41.550> got<00:01:41.730> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
there okay but then you still got a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.120 
there okay but then you still got a
metal<00:01:42.420> face<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> nice<00:01:43.710> soft<00:01:44.040> feel

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
metal face so you get a nice soft feel

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.630 
metal face so you get a nice soft feel
because<00:01:44.400> 85%<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.360> feel<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.780> down<00:01:46.230> to<00:01:46.620> down<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because 85% of feel is down to down to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.770 
because 85% of feel is down to down to
sound<00:01:47.960> okay<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.410> what<00:01:49.620> this<00:01:49.770> does<00:01:50.780> wave

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
sound okay but what this does wave

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
sound okay but what this does wave
that's<00:01:52.050> been<00:01:52.290> milled<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.460> that's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that's been milled and the way that's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.280 
that's been milled and the way that's
been<00:01:53.880> cut<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.570> combination<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
been cut and with the combination of the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.290 
been cut and with the combination of the
polymer<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.220> metal<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.060> puts<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
polymer and the metal is it puts the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.180 
polymer and the metal is it puts the
ball<00:01:57.570> into<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.870> forward<00:01:58.260> roll<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.680> that's

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
ball into a forward roll and that's

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.160 
ball into a forward roll and that's
really<00:01:59.640> really<00:02:00.120> really<00:02:00.300> important<00:02:01.050> because

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
really really really important because

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.800 
really really really important because
what<00:02:01.500> happens<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.160> that<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.150> skimming<00:02:03.600> on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
what happens is that you get skimming on

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.140 
what happens is that you get skimming on
on<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> putter<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.310> some<00:02:05.550> cases<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.120> can

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
on a putter and in some cases you can

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.790 
on a putter and in some cases you can
get<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.510> six<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.990> seven<00:02:07.260> inches<00:02:07.590> of

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
get up to six to seven inches of

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.130 
get up to six to seven inches of
skidding<00:02:08.459> which<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.789> half<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.149> foot<00:02:09.360> yeah<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.959> on

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
skidding which is half a foot yeah so on

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199 
skidding which is half a foot yeah so on
a<00:02:10.170> long<00:02:10.410> putt<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> 15-foot<00:02:11.370> putt<00:02:11.549> it's<00:02:12.060> not

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
a long putt like a 15-foot putt it's not

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.789 
a long putt like a 15-foot putt it's not
really<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> problem<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> five-foot<00:02:13.530> part

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
really a problem but a five-foot part

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.229 
really a problem but a five-foot part
protector<00:02:14.189> but<00:02:14.370> you've<00:02:14.519> got<00:02:14.640> half<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:15.000> foot<00:02:15.209> of

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
protector but you've got half a foot of

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.340 
protector but you've got half a foot of
skidding

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
skidding

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
skidding
what<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.860> able<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.910> does

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
what this is able to do and what it does

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.840 
what this is able to do and what it does
it<00:02:18.120> puts<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> ball<00:02:18.540> into<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.840> forward<00:02:19.080> roll

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
it puts the ball into a forward roll

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.100 
it puts the ball into a forward roll
immediately<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.570> what<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.810> does<00:02:21.960> is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
immediately and what that does is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.390 
immediately and what that does is
because<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.410> doesn't<00:02:22.620> skid<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> doesn't<00:02:23.220> skid

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
because it doesn't skid it doesn't skid

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.590 
because it doesn't skid it doesn't skid
through<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> brake<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.120> takes<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.420> break

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
through the brake it takes a break

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.090 
through the brake it takes a break
straightaway<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.200> you're<00:02:25.500> sure<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.890> pass<00:02:26.070> that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
straightaway so you're sure to pass that

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.250 
straightaway so you're sure to pass that
you<00:02:26.310> tend<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.760> five<00:02:27.000> foot<00:02:27.240> putts<00:02:27.570> gonna<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you tend to five foot putts gonna be a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.690 
you tend to five foot putts gonna be a
lot<00:02:28.350> more<00:02:28.470> consistent<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.430> you're<00:02:29.520> going<00:02:29.640> to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
lot more consistent and you're going to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
lot more consistent and you're going to
haul<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> lot<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.390> than<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.930> would<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
haul a lot more than you would do a

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
haul a lot more than you would do a
conventional<00:02:31.740> putter<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.250> an<00:02:32.370> insert

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
conventional putter with just an insert

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.990 
conventional putter with just an insert
or<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.150> no<00:02:33.270> face<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.720> okay<00:02:34.290> sounds<00:02:34.710> good<00:02:35.000> yeah

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
or just no face on okay sounds good yeah

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.960 
or just no face on okay sounds good yeah
I<00:02:38.570> think<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.810> most<00:02:40.140> most<00:02:41.130> Paislee<00:02:41.610> come<00:02:41.880> in

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
I think like most most Paislee come in

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.580 
I think like most most Paislee come in
different<00:02:42.060> lengths<00:02:42.450> yeah<00:02:42.690> different<00:02:43.230> lengths

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
different lengths yeah different lengths

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.580 
different lengths yeah different lengths
you<00:02:43.860> obviously<00:02:44.610> got<00:02:44.670> face<00:02:44.880> balance<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.720> etc

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you obviously got face balance and etc

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.900 
you obviously got face balance and etc
etc<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.370> actually<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.700> five

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
etc and you actually go to five

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.980 
etc and you actually go to five
different<00:02:48.150> designs<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:54.480> feels<00:02:54.630> nice<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
different designs it feels nice on the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.840 
different designs it feels nice on the
face<00:02:55.170> yeah<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:56.040> feels<00:02:56.250> nice<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.550> you've<00:02:56.730> got

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
face yeah it feels nice and you've got

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.700 
face yeah it feels nice and you've got
them<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> mallet<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.570> played<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.900> well

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
them in a mallet then I played as well

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.320 
them in a mallet then I played as well
just<00:02:59.220> start<00:02:59.430> eating<00:02:59.550> blades<00:02:59.940> you've<00:03:00.210> got<00:03:00.300> a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
just start eating blades you've got a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.700 
just start eating blades you've got a
slightly<00:03:00.810> different<00:03:00.990> mallet<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.440> you've<00:03:01.620> got

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
slightly different mallet so you've got

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.560 
slightly different mallet so you've got
three<00:03:01.980> designs<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.520> over<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.880> back<00:03:03.090> there

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
three designs just over the back there

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.300 
three designs just over the back there
so<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:05.190> malp<00:03:05.340> are<00:03:08.690> obviously<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.190> tiger<00:03:11.190> was

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so the malp are obviously the tiger was

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.710 
so the malp are obviously the tiger was
actually<00:03:11.580> use<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> open<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.510> year

with practicing with one of actually one
of<00:03:16.950> those<00:03:17.130> okay<00:03:22.520> see<00:03:23.520> fatigue<00:03:24.200> can<00:03:25.200> get

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
of those okay see fatigue can get

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:38.420 
of those okay see fatigue can get
furball<00:03:25.710> that's<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.280> tried<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.910> all
