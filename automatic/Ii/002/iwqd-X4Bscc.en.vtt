but it did win an answer really quickly

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.719 
but it did win an answer really quickly
like<00:01:05.199> sighs<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.680> get<00:01:05.890> feeling<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.310> guys<00:01:06.490> did

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
like sighs you get feeling the guys did

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.240 
like sighs you get feeling the guys did
have<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.939> compete<00:01:07.329> chance<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.899> buzz<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.710> think

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
have a compete chance to buzz in I think

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.890 
have a compete chance to buzz in I think
I<00:01:09.340> just<00:01:09.369> think<00:01:09.670> it's<00:01:09.760> not<00:01:09.909> fair<00:01:10.150> well<00:01:10.630> they<00:01:10.720> had

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
I just think it's not fair well they had

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.420 
I just think it's not fair well they had
a<00:01:10.930> system<00:01:11.350> where<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.560> actually<00:01:11.710> had<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.250> a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
a system where it actually had to a

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.760 
a system where it actually had to a
button<00:01:12.880> had<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.150> be<00:01:13.270> hit<00:01:13.510> but<00:01:13.900> it<00:01:13.960> was<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.590> to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
button had to be hit but it was going to

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.859 
button had to be hit but it was going to
quickly<00:01:15.010> so<00:01:15.490> in<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.060> sense<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.450> think<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.720> was

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
quickly so in that sense I think it was

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.870 
quickly so in that sense I think it was
unfair<00:01:17.290> mom<00:01:17.950> because<00:01:18.280> they<00:01:18.400> clearly<00:01:18.670> knew

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
unfair mom because they clearly knew

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.000 
unfair mom because they clearly knew
some<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.240> answers<00:01:19.420> um<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.619> idea<00:01:20.920> was

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
some of the answers um but the idea was

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.179 
some of the answers um but the idea was
what<00:01:21.880> can<00:01:22.180> we<00:01:22.360> it<00:01:22.720> was<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.260> idea<00:01:23.740> wasn't<00:01:23.950> that

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
what can we it was the idea wasn't that

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.010 
what can we it was the idea wasn't that
it<00:01:24.310> would<00:01:24.430> just<00:01:24.610> in<00:01:25.060> design<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.840> win

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
it would just in design it just to win

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.260 
it would just in design it just to win
on<00:01:26.140> Jeopardy<00:01:26.619> okay<00:01:27.280> they<00:01:27.520> designed<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.060> to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
on Jeopardy okay they designed it to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.050 
on Jeopardy okay they designed it to
show<00:01:29.049> what<00:01:29.320> computers<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:29.979> do<00:01:30.310> what<00:01:30.760> kind<00:01:31.000> of

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
show what computers can do what kind of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.120 
show what computers can do what kind of
information<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:31.960> can<00:01:32.080> give<00:01:32.380> these<00:01:32.530> computers

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
information we can give these computers

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.969 
information we can give these computers
and<00:01:33.369> how<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:34.150> can<00:01:34.180> change<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.869> way<00:01:35.049> they<00:01:35.619> think

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
and how we can change the way they think

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.210 
and how we can change the way they think
okay<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.509> what<00:01:37.689> that<00:01:37.720> might<00:01:38.110> mean<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
okay and what that might mean for the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.190 
okay and what that might mean for the
future<00:01:39.400> what<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:39.970> might<00:01:40.119> mean<00:01:40.180> for<00:01:40.390> progress

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
future what that might mean for progress

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.170 
future what that might mean for progress
not<00:01:41.470> what<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:41.770> might<00:01:41.890> mean<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.100> game<00:01:42.610> shows<00:01:42.880> I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
not what it might mean for game shows I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.760 
not what it might mean for game shows I
think<00:01:43.780> I'm<00:01:43.900> just<00:01:44.080> uncomfortable<00:01:44.229> with

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
think I'm just uncomfortable with

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.219 
think I'm just uncomfortable with
computers<00:01:45.220> getting<00:01:45.490> too<00:01:45.670> smart<00:01:46.229> understand

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
computers getting too smart understand

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.499 
computers getting too smart understand
but<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.979> think<00:01:48.460> this<00:01:48.579> what<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:48.790> just<00:01:49.090> would<00:01:49.479> be

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
but I think this what I just would be

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.050 
but I think this what I just would be
