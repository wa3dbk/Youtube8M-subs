00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.610
 starting to design your office 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.599
 either your room to build 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.150
 some masters get lost what is there 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.430
 hang how to decorate the walls like 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.489
 I propose to arrange this whole thing 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.450
 make out your office with meaning in 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.090
 the first place 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.420
 allow certificates more 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 certificates to all better 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.579
 be sure to lead them to the most prominent 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.219
 Your client’s place is literally three 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.470
 seconds to enter indoors immediately behind 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.000
 pizza for not looking and at least 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.880
 make sure they are available 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.690
 if there is one certificate hang it 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.980
 if there are 25 and decide all 25 of this good 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.579
 does not happen much 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 when a client sees certificates 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.339
 so many objection questions and even 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.259
 suspicions immediately disappear and you 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.930
 you probably won't have to answer 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.540
 uncomfortable questions such as how much you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.570
 work where did you study how long have you been 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 finished courses and so on in the second 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 location this reviews reviews can be made out 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.880
 differently she is recommended too 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.990
 hang them so that they cling to them 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.900
 look for example my time i did 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 board of balsa wood where at 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.979
 cling here are such different colored 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.350
 bumazhechki here it accommodates approximately 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 asleep but every client wanted 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 leave your mark and every new customer 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 and saw that firstly except him here 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.950
 someone already was clearly not the first 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.100
 comrade who came to us and secondly 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.470
 someone so liked that even 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.030
 left your recommendations impressions 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.380
 in third place are photographs of your work 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.360
 photos may be different 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 these are miniature framed 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.939
 you can also make them differently 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.950
 be pictures of big posters 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:14.670
 at least you do wallpaper here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.489
 there isn’t much good that can be good 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.040
 it will be your job because if 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.069
 the client will ask whether you have increased it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.519
 is it photographed cool if you are 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.430
 say yes I do not forget 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.349
 professional attributes such as 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.450
 cosmetology lamp sterilizer and 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.150
 perhaps a showcase with interesting products 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.569
 which can be useful to your client 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.959
 this way you earn bonuses 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:48.290
 eyes of the client and with other things being equal 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.290
 conditions your client will choose you
