00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
in my opinion i feel it's a little bit

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.900 
in my opinion i feel it's a little bit
lazy<00:02:25.830> designed<00:02:26.250> though<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.730> their<00:02:26.879> own

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910

just<00:02:28.860> saying<00:02:29.069> though<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.310> uh<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.209> they

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
just saying though that uh I think they

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420 
just saying though that uh I think they
should<00:02:30.780> go<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:31.980> deeper<00:02:32.129> than<00:02:32.340> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
should go a little bit deeper than that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.970 
should go a little bit deeper than that

on<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.079> fault<00:02:52.290> universe<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.430> like

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
on the fault universe so I really like

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.789 
on the fault universe so I really like
this<00:02:53.700> idea<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.180> there<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.420> one<00:02:54.660> little<00:02:55.319> niche

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
this idea but there is one little niche

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.000 
this idea but there is one little niche
to<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:58.049> well<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.709> can't

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to it and that is that well you can't

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.910 
to it and that is that well you can't
assuming<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.879> this<00:03:00.180> will<00:03:00.390> be<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.690> next<00:03:01.650> gen

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
assuming that this will be a next gen

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.289 
assuming that this will be a next gen
only<00:03:02.280> title<00:03:02.640> being<00:03:02.879> xbox<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:03.930> ps4<00:03:04.200> pc<00:03:05.299> you

only title being xbox one ps4 pc you

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.270 
only title being xbox one ps4 pc you
can't<00:03:06.599> really<00:03:06.750> import<00:03:07.290> your<00:03:07.379> save<00:03:07.650> data<00:03:07.680> onto

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.259 
can't really import your save data onto
this<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.519> i<00:03:08.549> don't<00:03:08.760> know<00:03:08.849> how<00:03:09.000> they<00:03:09.030> could

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
this so i don't know how they could

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.119 
this so i don't know how they could
really<00:03:09.750> recognize<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.349> site<00:03:10.590> activities

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
really recognize the site activities

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.740 
really recognize the site activities
that<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.879> done<00:03:12.060> maybe<00:03:12.269> they<00:03:12.450> could<00:03:12.599> just

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that you have done maybe they could just

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.420 
that you have done maybe they could just
do<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.930> regardless<00:03:13.079> assuming<00:03:13.890> you've<00:03:14.010> done<00:03:14.280> it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
do it regardless assuming you've done it

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.130 
do it regardless assuming you've done it
but<00:03:14.879> i<00:03:14.910> think<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.329> would<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.569> cool<00:03:15.840> to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
but i think it would be cool to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.710 
but i think it would be cool to
definitely<00:03:16.890> do<00:03:17.099> our<00:03:17.340> mention<00:03:18.180> what<00:03:18.540> you've

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
definitely do our mention what you've

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.500 
definitely do our mention what you've
done<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.700> or<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:20.910> these<00:03:21.060> characters

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
done in the or what these characters

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.920 
done in the or what these characters
I've<00:03:21.690> done<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.870> apologize<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.630> main<00:03:24.630> story

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
I've done I apologize in the main story

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.629 
I've done I apologize in the main story
like<00:03:25.200> what's<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> Canon<00:03:26.069> regardless<00:03:26.549> of

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
like what's in the Canon regardless of

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.129 
like what's in the Canon regardless of
your<00:03:26.730> choice<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.239> will<00:03:27.359> happen<00:03:27.569> if<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.989> get

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
your choice it will happen if you get

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.170 
your choice it will happen if you get
what<00:03:28.260> I'm<00:03:28.350> trying<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.620> say<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:30.090> it'd

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
what I'm trying to say and I think it'd

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.280 
what I'm trying to say and I think it'd
be<00:03:30.209> cool<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.540> hear<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.079> conversation

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
be cool to hear that conversation

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.160 
be cool to hear that conversation
between<00:03:31.859> NPCs<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.970> whatnot<00:03:33.359> I<00:03:33.569> think<00:03:34.079> this

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
between NPCs and whatnot I think this

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.690 
between NPCs and whatnot I think this
would<00:03:34.319> be<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.410> very<00:03:34.650> interesting<00:03:35.040> addition

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
would be a very interesting addition

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.129 
would be a very interesting addition
like<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.239> said<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.510> would<00:03:36.540> make<00:03:36.720> me<00:03:36.840> feel<00:03:36.870> like

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
like you said it would make me feel like

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.080 
like you said it would make me feel like
I<00:03:37.260> actually<00:03:37.500> had<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.799> lasting<00:03:38.310> impact<00:03:38.459> after

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
I actually had a lasting impact after

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.940 
I actually had a lasting impact after
all<00:03:39.299> these<00:03:39.599> years<00:03:39.989> people<00:03:40.590> are<00:03:40.680> still<00:03:40.889> talking

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
all these years people are still talking

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.099 
all these years people are still talking
about<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.579> heroic<00:03:42.030> acts<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.540> project

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
about my heroic acts of the project

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.470 
about my heroic acts of the project
purity<00:03:43.319> or<00:03:44.069> whatever<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.910> know<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.060> think<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
purity or whatever you know I think that

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.390 
purity or whatever you know I think that
would<00:03:45.569> be<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:45.660> cool<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:46.739> definitely<00:03:47.370> a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
would be really cool but definitely a

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.180

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
like you were the character but would

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.480 
like you were the character but would

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
the cutscene ideas I agree this is minus

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.580 
the cutscene ideas I agree this is minus
what<00:04:49.599> he<00:04:49.660> said<00:04:49.810> about<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.080> voice<00:04:50.169> acted

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
what he said about the voice acted

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.510 
what he said about the voice acted
character<00:04:50.889> I<00:04:50.919> don't<00:04:51.130> think<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:51.370> says

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
character I don't think that says

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.089 
character I don't think that says
they'll<00:04:51.669> go<00:04:51.880> down<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.240> route<00:04:52.680> anyways<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.860> do

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
they'll go down that route anyways I do

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.740 
they'll go down that route anyways I do
think<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.610> first<00:04:54.880> person<00:04:55.270> cutscenes<00:04:55.630> are

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
think that first person cutscenes are

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.200 
think that first person cutscenes are
very<00:04:56.139> cool<00:04:56.349> idea<00:04:56.650> instead<00:04:56.949> of<00:04:57.099> much<00:04:57.639> like<00:04:57.940> any

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
very cool idea instead of much like any

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.749 
very cool idea instead of much like any
other<00:04:58.300> bethesda<00:04:59.050> game<00:04:59.259> where<00:04:59.830> they<00:05:00.430> kind<00:05:00.669> of

in<00:05:11.169> on<00:05:11.289> the<00:05:11.380> character<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:12.190> know<00:05:12.220> you're<00:05:12.460> just

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
in on the character you know you're just

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.550 
in on the character you know you're just
talking<00:05:12.940> them<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.240> that's<00:05:13.389> it<00:05:13.630> i<00:05:13.810> think<00:05:14.440> it

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
talking them and that's it i think it

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.870 
talking them and that's it i think it
would<00:05:14.620> be<00:05:14.740> cool<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.039> kind<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.580> see<00:05:15.759> your

would be cool to kind of see your

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.399 
would be cool to kind of see your
character<00:05:16.210> walk<00:05:16.419> around<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:17.020> stuff<00:05:17.139> instead

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
character walk around and stuff instead

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.080 
character walk around and stuff instead
of<00:05:17.530> just<00:05:17.650> being<00:05:17.770> locked<00:05:18.069> in<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.370> conversation

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
of just being locked in the conversation

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.089 
of just being locked in the conversation
scenes<00:05:19.360> something<00:05:20.349> like<00:05:20.500> actually<00:05:20.860> I've<00:05:20.979> been

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
scenes something like actually I've been

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.529 
scenes something like actually I've been
playing<00:05:21.310> this<00:05:21.490> recently<00:05:21.849> mass<00:05:22.090> effect<00:05:22.419> or

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
playing this recently mass effect or

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:23.969 
playing this recently mass effect or
when<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.780> make<00:05:22.930> those<00:05:23.080> choices<00:05:23.349> and<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.889> know

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
when you make those choices and you know

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.559 
when you make those choices and you know
at<00:05:24.190> that<00:05:24.220> choice<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.789> might<00:05:24.940> walk<00:05:25.270> with

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
at that choice you might walk with

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.749 
at that choice you might walk with
someone<00:05:26.020> or<00:05:26.560> they<00:05:26.710> might<00:05:26.830> do<00:05:26.979> an<00:05:27.099> animation<00:05:27.430> I

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
someone or they might do an animation I

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.820 
someone or they might do an animation I
think<00:05:28.180> that<00:05:28.330> would<00:05:28.419> be<00:05:28.509> very<00:05:28.539> very<00:05:28.900> very<00:05:29.470> cool

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
think that would be very very very cool

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.339 
think that would be very very very cool
and<00:05:30.039> yeah<00:05:30.759> the<00:05:30.940> idea<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.449> for<00:05:31.960> example<00:05:31.990> like

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
and yeah the idea of for example like

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.170 
and yeah the idea of for example like
