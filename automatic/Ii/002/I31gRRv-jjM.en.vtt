00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 when do I think back to all those years 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.610
 an idiotic debate about school we're going to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.020
 do it in three episodes because there is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.970
 Too much to say that they broadcast to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.289
 say before if too late in this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.640
 first episode we'll talk about three 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.029
 completely mind- blowing stuff so much 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029
 it's absurd 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 the materials so where does it come from 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 delirious to separate knowledge during 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 an hour that is French after you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.220
 do maths 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.140
 after you do chemistry no brain 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.700
 do not learn like that imagine a meal where 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 you would die from boiling water from 8 to 9 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 is not packs 8 of 9 to 10 of butter 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 from 10 to 11 and grated GruyÃ¨re de 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.360
 11am to noon when a child learns 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 walk he was not training on a 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 leg for one hour and on the other 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.920
 heavy legs after I believe that the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 people who designed the school system 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.820
 they sounded like that the brain 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 stock is given we send the data 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.510
 we send the data we send the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.640
 data while the brain works 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 not at all like that in reality the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 brain creates links between data 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.800
 what memories do you remember 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.820
 remember the best finally it's 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.330
 always things where there was a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.009
 emotion a meaning a usefulness some 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.149
 thing for you that made the link there 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.340
 we are in a system completely 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.530
 absurd it's like pouring 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.810
 water in a bucket where there would be no 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.369
 fund in fact as we say it goes back by 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.690
 one ear comes out the other and the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.399
 most people they even remember 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.700
 not 2 2% of the things they learned to 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.640
 school 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 2 the places we completely forgot about it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 when you are an adult 1 gerard no longer 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.840
 that one desire is never again 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.110
 hear about the school but 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.420
 remember the corridors of the pet on 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.780
 the beloved 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.280
 classes of the ground lines of the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.259
 canteens continuously so well in the canteen 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.909
 it's good we're happy when we go to 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.320
 the canteen because it's like 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.940
 pause imagine yourself sitting at a table 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.840
 surrounded by four walls yeah bah when 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 it's cold it's cool 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.820
 under neon lights oil lighting 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.470
 crazy with 30 people around ah ben if 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 we can laugh you can not 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.400
 laughed for a whole day during 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.340
 a whole week 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 for a whole year for more than 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.140
 ten years 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.180
 cd physical spatial reality 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.290
 there is like an atmosphere of how that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.030
 is called when we are in a place 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.030
 closed that we can not go out 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.120
 3 both ways when we come back from 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.680
 sideboard around five o'clock in the evening we 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.910
 want to surf the net see his friends 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.440
 green sports play video games 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.780
 will go magazine listen to music the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.560
 nand hand there to control I have to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.560
 learn my lesson 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.410
 seriously there is something more disgusting 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.240
 in life that homework to do the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.190
 evening at home when you already come from 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.210
 hitting a whole day of school they 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.350
 see that they can not reach us 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.700
 bring their programs whores 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.230
 in the brain then he asks us 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.090
 to learn from us the time you 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.800
 passions of course your lessons well 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.930
 sure you are course tool is good 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.330
 understand that should be included in 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.560
 the school day nothing can replace the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.000
 personal work 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.410
 it is true that there are only those who 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.170
 work at home they succeed 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.700
 what then why we work 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.440
 not only here because there is only 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.090
 we learn why we are going to spend eight 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.410
 hours a day in a place where one 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.880
 is supposed to learn stuff but that 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.170
 does not it work then in the end 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.170
 we will be obliged to apprentice with us 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.680
 precisely if most of those who are 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.600
 in school failure it's because he 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.190
 not working at home 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.620
 it may mean that there is a small 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.420
 problem on the official day at 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.850
 the concert school may not work 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 great what you're stopped here 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.510
 it was the first idiot debate on 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.020
 school I hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.400
 not kill myself too much in the 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.230
 comments because there are still two 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.430
 other episodes on this theme that are going 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.070
 to arrive so here is keep a little 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.230
 of energy for the future 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.910
 you have to go to class but I 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.510
 go away subscribe to the channel 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.510

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.770
