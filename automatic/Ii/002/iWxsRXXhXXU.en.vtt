00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
through this cancer fight I don't think

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.490 
through this cancer fight I don't think
anybody<00:01:21.660> should<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.200> through<00:01:22.230> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
anybody should have to go through it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.190 
anybody should have to go through it
alone<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:23.520> hopefully<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:24.930> platform

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
alone so hopefully I can use my platform

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
alone so hopefully I can use my platform
to<00:01:25.710> bring<00:01:25.890> awareness<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.340> pediatric<00:01:26.910> cancer

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to bring awareness to pediatric cancer

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.060 
to bring awareness to pediatric cancer
and<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.870> lot<00:01:28.050> of<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.470> understand<00:01:28.890> how

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and a lot of people to understand how

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
and a lot of people to understand how
hard<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.550> for<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.850> family<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.270> go<00:01:30.420> through<00:01:30.660> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
hard it is for a family to go through it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
hard it is for a family to go through it
so<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.830> myself<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.250> other<00:01:32.460> families

so not just myself but other families
can<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> support<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.720> everybody
