00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.520
 very good friends and subscribers today 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.040
 I bring the most expected of poke m have 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.080
 implemented a new update and 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.420
 with it they have opened the front of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.670
 battle have also implemented several 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.830
 very good things which will make more sense 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.340
 to the game in this video I'll show you 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.340
 some 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.050
 one of the things that I see that are very 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.910
 well done is that they will no longer depend on 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.399
 patches to put the game in Spanish 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.620
 since now you can put the roms of 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.500
 pokemon as much as fire red and pokemon 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.540
 Emerald in Spanish I will leave you all 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.820
 the links in the video description 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.280
 to download them, look, I'm 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.449
 inside the battle front let's go to 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.449
 see a bit to see what 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.260
 another very good thing is that now it 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.700
 they will see the faces of the clan members 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 look how good it looks 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.020
 and for those who had problems with the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.660
 sheets look now the tips will be 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.010
 confirmed so this will save them a 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.010
 headache to many 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.930
 and now the most important thing to see is that we 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.930
 bring the battle front 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.260
 they have also added a search engine 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.050
 of pokemons in the pc boxes and 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.270
 they can also mark several pokemons already 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.420
 either to release them or move them to another 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420
 box 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.450
 also in the description of the video them 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.550
 I'll leave the forum link to look 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 everything they have added there are ways 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.480
 cooperatives for some battles 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.520
 doubles but I'll leave that for the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.010
 next video 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.780
 and other things that have been implemented is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.150
 that there are now skills that if 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.850
 may use out of combat as per 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.250
 example the skill collected body 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.490
 flame and others that increase or reduce 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.050
 encounters with the wild pokÃ©mons 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.850
 Well now I leave you with a brief 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.580
 traveled of what is the front of 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.710
 battle and I say goodbye until next time 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.160
 forget to give little hand up and share 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.160
 for more
