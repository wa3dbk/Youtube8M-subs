to<00:02:03.570> catch<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> last<00:02:04.439> year's<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to catch a little bit of last year's and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
to catch a little bit of last year's and
thought<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.430> pretty<00:02:05.640> much<00:02:05.880> crap<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.540> i

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
thought it was pretty much crap but i

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150

guess<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> difference<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.770> year<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
guess the difference this year is that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.850 
guess the difference this year is that
