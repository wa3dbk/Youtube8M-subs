to<00:03:06.590> mix<00:03:07.129> like<00:03:07.670> my<00:03:07.849> traditional<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.689> cultural

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
to mix like my traditional and cultural

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.699 
to mix like my traditional and cultural

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.550 
learnings in with sort of modern-day
science<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.819> good<00:03:13.969> way<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:15.109> one<00:03:15.319> get

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
science and it's a good way to one get

people interested in science especially

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.110 
people interested in science especially
from<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.719> indigenous<00:03:17.930> communities<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.120> also

from the indigenous communities and also

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.229 
from the indigenous communities and also
to<00:03:20.620> look<00:03:21.620> at<00:03:21.709> our<00:03:21.950> indigenous<00:03:22.459> plants<00:03:23.030> which<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
to look at our indigenous plants which a

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.000 
to look at our indigenous plants which a
lot<00:03:23.359> of<00:03:23.389> people<00:03:23.480> think<00:03:23.840> are<00:03:24.019> just<00:03:24.049> medicine

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
lot of people think are just medicine

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.520 
lot of people think are just medicine
plants<00:03:25.159> are<00:03:25.340> just<00:03:25.489> now<00:03:25.700> who<00:03:26.629> do<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.290> good

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
plants are just now who do but it's good

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.140 
plants are just now who do but it's good
that<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.859> can<00:03:28.040> take<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.400> back<00:03:28.639> to<00:03:28.760> lab<00:03:28.939> and

that you can take this back to lab and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.270 
that you can take this back to lab and
prove<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.599> was<00:03:29.689> actually<00:03:30.109> like<00:03:30.349> there

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
prove that it was actually like there

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.000 
prove that it was actually like there
were<00:03:31.370> medicinal<00:03:31.939> properties<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:33.010> finding
