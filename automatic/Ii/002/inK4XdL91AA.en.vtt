00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
because of some crucial flaw and my

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.920 
because of some crucial flaw and my
arguments<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.799> can't<00:03:48.100> own<00:03:48.310> up<00:03:48.340> to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
actually I left out the verse because it

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.000 
actually I left out the verse because it
is<00:03:51.430> irrelevant<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.209> my<00:03:52.329> argument<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.140> simply

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
is irrelevant to my argument it simply
