for the rest of my life I think if we

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.250

try<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> analyze<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:09.180> formula<00:01:09.720> too<00:01:09.870> much<00:01:10.050> we'd

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
try to analyze our formula too much we'd

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
try to analyze our formula too much we'd
lose<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.010> magic<00:01:11.340> about<00:01:11.550> there's<00:01:12.150> like

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.910 
lose what was magic about there's like
this<00:01:12.510> balance<00:01:12.960> between<00:01:13.110> fantasy<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> reality

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
