00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
handycam it's a little bit bigger but at

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.279 
handycam it's a little bit bigger but at
least<00:00:28.859> still<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.640> mini<00:00:30.000> DV<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> tapes

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
least still it's mini DV but the tapes

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.979 
least still it's mini DV but the tapes
are<00:00:32.059> probably<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.210> three<00:00:33.540> inches<00:00:33.809> they're

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
