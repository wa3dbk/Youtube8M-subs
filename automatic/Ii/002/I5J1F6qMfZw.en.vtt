00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello I am today with Laura 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.990
 haftmann professional sculptors on 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.360
 fruits and vegetables and founder of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 designer futures he gives you all these 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.740
 tips and tricks to achieve 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.410
 beautiful decorations for your plates 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.359
 or dishes for example laurent you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 now explains how to make a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 pink with a tomato 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
 look good so I show you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.070
 how to make a rose tomato 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 it's really very minute but 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 you will see after a few few 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.410
 tests you will have to get there without 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.329
 problem to carve this rose but 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.430
 you need a paring knife and then 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.050
 of course a tomato so for 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 start we will remove the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.390
 peduncle here and after I take my 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 knife I will come to give a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 incision like these pretty straight 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.270
 like what will be useful for us 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 to support this rose and after 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.449
 I go over to the tomato as if I 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.760
 had to peel an apple with a 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.920
 knife just then very 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.939
 delicately I will do all the trick 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.939
 like this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.829
 but really do not hesitate to take 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.869
 your time because it's really a 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.869
 quite delicate culture 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.700
 but here I go back to the top 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.290
 so sometimes it may be that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.670
 your knife from the terminals or copy the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.670
 skin really completely 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.530
 do not hesitate to continue your 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.260
 your decor p then in the end we will see nothing 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.510
 at all once we get there 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.910
 really the final construction of this 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.620
 flower it will not be seen at all so there 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.920
 you still see very thin skin 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.090
 preferably really just below 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.510
 here you see it here we see a little 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.510
 little through 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:09.280
 So here is I want to start 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.780
 reduce the width of the skin 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.430
 after that it's going to make us 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.430
 the heart of the rose actually 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.720
 so that's it once it's over 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.140
 tomato in greatest need is to be 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.820
 just work with the skin in fact there 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.610
 must put the flesh inside 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.390
 it's very important because in fact the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.610
 bright is going to be to make us the side 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.080
 outside of this rose so there I the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.220
 rul 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.420
 yes that's why I told you 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.810
 just now it's pretty tricky to 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.040
 realize anyway and here I wound 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.490
 until the end you have to do really 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.490
 very careful 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.610
 that's getting easier 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.240
 it's a technique we all learn to 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.290
 school nevertheless still need to know 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.290
 do it correctly 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.920
 here after I just have to ask everything 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.549
 that I rolled on the first support 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.450
 that I had a side of the peduncle and 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.989
 after I can put my tomatoes see 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.269
 on a plate and possibly 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.260
 I can their work is slightly for 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.430
 open it a little bit more why not 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.620
 so so our rose is now 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.480
 completed so that it fits 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.970
 really more do not hesitate to the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.800
 just possibly cover it 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.000
 of a little bit of fine play and like 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.590
 it really will hold anyway 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.849
 pretty much what it is 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.410
 still working with the skin 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.000
 the tomato so these axes and fragile 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.200
 do not hesitate to put a little bit of 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.980
 jelly and then here is the moment she 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.980
 should hold properly
