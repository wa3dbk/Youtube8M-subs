00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome to with ay 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.460
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.500
 once I bring you a mini trick 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.180
 interesting that will allow us to remove the 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.920
 negative effects within our 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.480
 minecraft eros 360 that I mean with 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.740
 negative effects then to the poison or 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.240
 any of the states that we 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.009
 they transfer the potions that we can 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.020
 take before showing you the trick I wanted 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.320
 send a greeting to luis bue the head 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.520
 to killer zombies or minions grunt 250 that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.230
 were the three subscribers that 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.180
 they shared this mini trick with me 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.739
 some of you probably already know 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.210
 this trick because it 's an old trick 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.460
 I started working for quite a few 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.809
 versions but in minecraft 2 361 me 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.940
 had realized until now that it 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.620
 could use what we're going to do or what 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.510
 what we need is a vaquita and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.700
 just some iron juices the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.230
 buckets of milk can be drunk if 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.060
 you have tasted surely you will have 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.010
 realized that doing nothing does not 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.810
 nothing when our state in minecraft 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.310
 is normal but if for example we are 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.990
 poisoned or under the effect of a 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.910
 What potion will do is remove that effect 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.500
 I will teach you for example with a 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.300
 poison potion this works for 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.820
 any kind of potion like 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.590
 it would work and it's pretty simple what 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.270
 only thing we have to do is when 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.490
 we are under the effect of the potion as 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.260
 you see here I'm poisoned what we're going 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.210
 to do is to drink us our bucket of 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.799
 milk 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.960
 and will serve as an antidote and we will be 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.430
 totally cured we can be 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.170
 quite useful for example if we are 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.180
 playing with friends with splash 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.740
 potions in plan a combat or something by 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.320
 the style thing that would give us an advantage 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.000
 pretty good can also serve us 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.800
 for other things in survival that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.360
 they can be quite interesting as 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
 eat rotten meat you already know that if 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.899
 we eat rotten meat gives us an effect 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.550
 negative that is called hunger 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.530
 drinking our milk cube too 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.780
 we will become immune which allows us 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.130
 have another power source than the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.320
 rotten meat in the end you get 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.179
 pretty much if we're killing zombies so 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.160
 can serve us to survive another 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.350
 effect for which this antidote of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.899
 milk we can be useful is for 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.070
 remove the poison from the spiders of 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.570
 cave you know that the mines 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.490
 abandoned tend to leave a lot of 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.320
 spiders of this style and take us a couple 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.360
 of milk cubes can be quite 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.039
 interesting above all to facilitate us 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 a little survival and attacks 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.280
 of these spiders and this is all guys 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.170
 I hope this video is useful 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.119

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.100
