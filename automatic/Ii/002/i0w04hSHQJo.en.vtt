00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:17.599
 hello dear reader of mattoscacco.com 8 today that I wanted to do a video review 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.439
 and watch book bobby fischer teaches chess 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.070
 it was one of my first chess books and I have to say I was 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.999
 really enthusiastic 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.390
 it is a practical book and all other differences 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.829
 children are read to the maximum to reproduce the moves of a chessboard 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 everything is ready for you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.890
 d there was no chessboard the jail diagrams drawn 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.410
 divided reasoning 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.380
 practice now 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:55.630
 let's explain to you practically bones the book here is yes index forum station 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.090
 I started firenze if the value of third parties 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.510
 converse examples 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.080
 as you form at chess 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.100
 and then 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.240
 begins with the elements checkmate this the first understood 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 very important verification 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.150
 here explains how a game of chess pieces works 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 whites where my own are to be inserted 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.320
 and so they start the first two years I want the left I say to see 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.340
 why 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.650
 leg 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.810
 we will only look at the page on the right, the one on the left looks around 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.190
 then the book of writing will be turned upside down 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.140
 then for example 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.410
 biava this 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.620
 of the happy diagram 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.360
 the question you said white gives checkmate in this situation 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.400
 under castles 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.630
 chef is the relationship between the white lady under the Hon. from 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.900
 however cover or can not capture 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.710
 d the solution of the leaf after the solution at the top 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.610
 and in fact black cannot capture the black woman so these questions are 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.390
 essential for beginner begins to become familiar with the pieces and not 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.379
 only 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.390
 start to see how it can capture which piece because it is for a 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.399
 beginner really hard to start understanding 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.799
 but the piece of wire system that cannot be captured especially darren 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.799
 and here below the present this time however 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:41.219
 can capture the queen so only know if it is more so whistle 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:47.249
 you do not change understood, however, a book really lawns. many 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.119
 questions 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:55.199
 I suggest you try to do it over and over again that the texts to write 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.359
 such pencils answers as you can 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.359
 cancel yourself experimentally 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.329
 I'm really satisfied 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.009
 for example here 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:10.300
 the question is white can be saved by playing or take torrents 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.040
 obviously I think a little brush maker because defended by the woman 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.009
 these are the ones for you that you are the first chapter 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:22.709
 as we go on we will see the well-stocked they were really difficult 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.069
 for example 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.279
 let's go then 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.609
 explains 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.689
 clara to the forces needed to map the Mediterranean make us a little more 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.019
 complex computers yes 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.559
 but that goes on 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.109
 nothing is always difficult 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.549
 then once 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.549
 the book also ends 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.709
 for the summer, the father and father answer 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:53.939
 ok you turn the page and always looked at yourself again 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.739
 I know crazy agreements right 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.949
 solution 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.079
 ddlhits solution 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.539
 solution and always question this way 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.539
 who is here 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.169
 the rai sport the question was 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.849
 bring now that you determine if white can checkmate 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.560
 I am found to be wrong 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.210
 with one of the combinations he learned 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.230
 bondi 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.499
 castegnato 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:29.089
 the various ways to remotely including dead on the potato lick this case you can 

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:30.400
 make checkmate 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.379
 because the take torrent 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.690
 to make the tower finally go down at night 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.599
 contact 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.919
 I think it's really a good book
