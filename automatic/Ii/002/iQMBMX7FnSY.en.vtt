00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 good evening and welcome to reviewers in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.550
 this video annex where I'm just going 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.710
 try to catch up with a 15th then says the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 bullshit is the time I said 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 actually that the villagers do not 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.590
 could not reproduce since 1.3 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.109
 so in fact is not that they do not 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.250
 can no longer reproduce 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:33.300
 is that since the 1 point 2.6 or 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 1.3 he can not actually signed 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 to the port that before was dyed to a door 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 by house and inside the house 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 it was necessary that the door itself as a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.530
 stuck to the road to make effect then 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 that now it's easier 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 count to the number of doors around the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.190
 town 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.449
 so in fact there the goal will be very simple 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.640
 it will be to make small houses to 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.080
 the double door that sticks we will do 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.850
 a tower like this and you will see that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.390
 group the viÃ©geois breed very 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 very quickly 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:26.220
 so we find the small villages 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:28.020
 war we find the golems and finally 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 we arrive at a time when we can 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 really trade as much as you can 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.390
 find easily all the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:43.729
 diversification ie the swords 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:48.810
 Diamond Disenchanting Potions 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.070
 one can also find the best 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.500
 exchange light ie 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.439
 whoever wants chicken life this one 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 will sell you 9 chicken for the for the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.520
 same price and bard you prefer 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560
 eventually take the one who in 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.079
 sell h 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.530
 ditto for purchases the one that you 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.530
 will buy 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:13.519
 whoever will buy you 35 sheets of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.470
 the one who will enchant you 30 sheets 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.870
 you prefer the one who will buy you 30 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.349
 leaves this way it will suffice 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.209
 then eliminate the least 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:31.299
 practice what they would not have that 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.299
 you want or anything 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.599
 other practical thing too you can 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.549
 see it in 1.4 the mine in 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.170
 arrangement of logs has been improved 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.720
 before it was a little bit of mess 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.879
 while now I know that even though 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.780
 I stand like that I ask the 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.099
 butte ottoman 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.840
 she will automatically stick to 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.209
 common sense compared to other buses 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.690
 whereas before it was a little war 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.690
 Gulf 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.230
 their course do not forget anyway 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.889
 to give a staircase to your floor 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.889
 history they can not punish 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:34.340
 will never reach household so 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.340
 here it's easy what else 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:11.229
 because here it is there we have our 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.550
 first goolen pretty quickly when 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.169
 even so we can see that actually 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.460
 it's not the number of houses that 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.030
 account but indeed the number of 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.860
 doors 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.770
 its strength to place doors everywhere 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.720
 that the golan eventually appeared and 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:31.630
 not the number of villagers 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.800
 even in a village where there is very little 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.490
 of villagers but there are many 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.830
 many doors 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.370
 there will still be some golems for 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.370
 secure two 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.479
 you want not lit dwellings 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.809
 the lighting is important enough if you 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:27.659
 want all are safe 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:28.439
 or just simply for a 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:33.080
 ethical issue 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:35.699
 so if it evokes in the other it 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.930
 and you do not declare the same 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:44.369
 bombs have directly or indirectly 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:47.339
 in your villages in it will not be 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:49.229
 close at all is so born to 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:52.139
 third day the first children 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.479
 if it's not wonderful and new 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.319
 if they have a few days later 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.469
 actively but still had 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.639
 really more kids who is balad 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:02.819
 denser population in general 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:05.580
 finally more varied always a golem 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.219
 in my opinion if I had continued soon 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.379
 two which shows us well that 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.969
 finally once the building is 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.559
 built of children continue to 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.079
 swarm 

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:18.409
 it still does not go there is time 

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:21.089
 more children every day 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:23.849
 so do not hurry to do big 

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:26.039
 buildings I was just a lot 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:28.379
 many doors or house that you 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:30.349
 do and and you'll see well seen that 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:34.139
 your population is changing 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:36.800
 this is for the video annexes and here is a 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.800
 network problem
