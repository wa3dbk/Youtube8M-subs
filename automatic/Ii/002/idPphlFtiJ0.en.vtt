without getting sore wrists so there's a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.589 
without getting sore wrists so there's a
lot<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.290> factors<00:00:10.710> there<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.099> play<00:00:11.340> into<00:00:11.599> how

your wrists feel with weight overhead a
few<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.949> if<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.190> very<00:00:17.340> long<00:00:17.550> arms

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
few of them if you have very long arms

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.510 
few of them if you have very long arms
you<00:00:18.359> might<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> grab<00:00:18.930> very<00:00:19.230> wide<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you might have to grab very wide to do a

you might have to grab very wide to do a
snatch<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.570> hit<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.930> right<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.320> your

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
snatch and have it hit you right on your

snatch and have it hit you right on your
hips<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.039> supposed<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.000> very

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
hips like it's supposed to so I very

hips like it's supposed to so I very
long<00:00:24.570> arms<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.960> grab<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> way<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
long arms I grab all the way out to the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
long arms I grab all the way out to the
caller's<00:00:26.490> then<00:00:27.029> when<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.240> overhead<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.810> not

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
caller's then when I'm overhead it's not

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
caller's then when I'm overhead it's not
really<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.199> high<00:00:28.529> above<00:00:28.920> my<00:00:29.130> head<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
really that high above my head and I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.540 
really that high above my head and I
have<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> pretty<00:00:30.599> steep<00:00:30.960> wrist<00:00:31.830> angle<00:00:32.279> here

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
have a pretty steep wrist angle here

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.760 
have a pretty steep wrist angle here
because<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.180> wide<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:34.140> wider<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.649> way

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
because it's so wide but wider the way

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
because it's so wide but wider the way
it<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.489> more<00:00:35.700> my<00:00:35.910> wrists<00:00:36.390> will<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it is the more my wrists will have to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.729 
it is the more my wrists will have to
bend<00:00:37.790> in<00:00:38.790> order<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> get<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> weight<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:40.620> my

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bend in order to get the weight or my

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.280 
bend in order to get the weight or my
elbows<00:00:41.129> locked<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.329> order<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
weight on all the way on my palm so if

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
weight on all the way on my palm so if
you're<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> person<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.640> has<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.090> long<00:00:48.390> arms

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you're a person that has very long arms

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.200 
you're a person that has very long arms
and<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> grab<00:00:50.010> very<00:00:50.309> wide<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and you have to grab very wide on the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
and you have to grab very wide on the
bar<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.440> adequate<00:00:53.039> shoulder

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
bar if you have adequate shoulder

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790 
bar if you have adequate shoulder
mobility<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> overhead<00:00:55.440> squat<00:00:55.649> with

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
mobility and you can overhead squat with

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.799 
mobility and you can overhead squat with
a<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.100> narrow<00:00:56.399> grip<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.660> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
a more narrow grip that will put you in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
a more narrow grip that will put you in
a<00:00:57.840> slightly<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.579> straight<00:00:59.579> wrist<00:00:59.879> position

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
a slightly more straight wrist position

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
a slightly more straight wrist position
where<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.660> having<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> crank<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
where you're not having to crank to the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
where you're not having to crank to the
side<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.930> grab

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
side kind of like this when you grab

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.280 
side kind of like this when you grab
super<00:01:04.979> wide<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:06.180> you're<00:01:06.360> snatching<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
super wide so if you're snatching you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.590 
super wide so if you're snatching you
know<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.619> grab<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.040> wide<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.420> you're

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
know go and grab as wide but if you're

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.510 
know go and grab as wide but if you're
just<00:01:09.840> doing<00:01:09.990> overhead<00:01:10.470> squats<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.310> you're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
just doing overhead squats if you're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 
just doing overhead squats if you're
pulling<00:01:11.909> off<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.210> blocks<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.490> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
pulling off of blocks or if you're you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.620 
pulling off of blocks or if you're you
know<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.670> you're<00:01:14.700> doing<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> behind<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
know if you're doing like a behind the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.929 
know if you're doing like a behind the
neck<00:01:15.810> jerk<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.670> into<00:01:17.850> an

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
neck jerk and then going into an

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.429 
neck jerk and then going into an
overhead<00:01:18.180> squat<00:01:18.540> after<00:01:18.840> jerking<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.200> overhead

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
overhead squat after jerking it overhead

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
overhead squat after jerking it overhead
you're<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:19.890> snatching<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> weight

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you're not actually snatching the weight

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
you're not actually snatching the weight
then<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.479> okay<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> try<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> narrow<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:23.070> your

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
then it's okay to try to narrow up your

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
then it's okay to try to narrow up your
grip<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> it'll<00:01:24.659> probably

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
grip a little bit and it'll probably

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
grip a little bit and it'll probably
save<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.500> wrists<00:01:25.890> over<00:01:26.040> time

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
save your wrists over time

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
save your wrists over time
same<00:01:27.360> thing<00:01:27.570> especially<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.259> you're<00:01:28.350> doing

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
same thing especially if you're doing

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
same thing especially if you're doing
high<00:01:29.060> repetition<00:01:30.060> sets<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.900> doing

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
high repetition sets if you're doing

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
high repetition sets if you're doing
overhead<00:01:31.409> squats<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> metcon<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.340> example

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
overhead squats in a metcon for example

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
overhead squats in a metcon for example
it<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.240> probably<00:01:33.390> save<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.930> wrists<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.100> go

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it will probably save your wrists to go

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.210 
it will probably save your wrists to go
a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.240> narrow<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.680> need<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
a little bit more narrow but you need a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.660 
a little bit more narrow but you need a
better<00:01:38.759> shoulder<00:01:39.360> mobility<00:01:40.159> overhead<00:01:41.159> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
better shoulder mobility overhead in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.789

person that catches your overhead squat
like<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.470> you're<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.609> have<00:02:52.730> you

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
like this and you're going to have you

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
know pain in a lot of places probably

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.069 
know pain in a lot of places probably
not<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.739> your<00:02:54.890> wrist<00:02:55.069> if<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:56.000> push<00:02:56.870> your

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
not just your wrist if you can push your

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.229 
not just your wrist if you can push your
knees<00:02:57.290> forward<00:02:57.680> still<00:02:58.250> with<00:02:58.760> your<00:02:58.879> weight<00:02:59.030> on

knees forward still with your weight on

knees forward still with your weight on
your<00:02:59.269> heels<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.230> get<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.560> more<00:03:00.920> upright<00:03:01.430> torso

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
your heels and get a more upright torso

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.030 
your heels and get a more upright torso
then<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.840> more<00:03:03.109> likely<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.650> you're<00:03:03.920> going

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
then it's more likely that you're going

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.979 
then it's more likely that you're going
to<00:03:04.099> be<00:03:04.220> able<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.459> keep<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.819> straight<00:03:05.030> wrist<00:03:05.329> and

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
to be able to keep a straight wrist and

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.160 
to be able to keep a straight wrist and
come<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.260> out<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.590> position<00:03:07.510> with<00:03:08.510> with

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
come up out of that position with with

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.599 
come up out of that position with with
that<00:03:09.319> straighter<00:03:09.680> wrist<00:03:09.980> where<00:03:10.400> you're<00:03:10.489> not

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
that straighter wrist where you're not

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.610 
that straighter wrist where you're not
broken<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.120> hyper-extended<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.019> then

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
broken and hyper-extended and then

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.949 
broken and hyper-extended and then
hopefully<00:03:13.250> you'll<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.579> less<00:03:14.150> wrist<00:03:14.510> pain<00:03:14.720> as

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
hopefully you'll have less wrist pain as

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.030 
hopefully you'll have less wrist pain as
a<00:03:15.019> result<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.760> other<00:03:16.910> thing<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:18.040> you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
a result the other thing is that you

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.589 
a result the other thing is that you
know<00:03:19.130> snatches<00:03:19.639> might<00:03:19.790> not<00:03:19.970> be<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.389> only
