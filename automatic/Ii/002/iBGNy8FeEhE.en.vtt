it's<00:01:05.860> very<00:01:06.100> very<00:01:06.400> hard<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.120> what<00:01:07.330> i<00:01:07.360> did<00:01:07.510> was<00:01:08.080> i

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
it's very very hard so what i did was i

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.440 
it's very very hard so what i did was i
bought<00:01:08.770> some<00:01:08.800> stones<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.730> i<00:01:09.790> put<00:01:10.000> them<00:01:10.090> in<00:01:10.300> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
bought some stones and i put them in the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.450 
bought some stones and i put them in the
cop<00:01:10.690> and<00:01:10.900> this<00:01:11.470> keeps<00:01:11.710> all<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:11.980> my<00:01:12.190> brushes

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
cop and this keeps all of my brushes

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.540 
cop and this keeps all of my brushes
standing<00:01:13.030> up<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.510> whenever<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.290> need<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.920> brush<00:01:15.250> I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
standing up so whenever I need a brush I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.110 
standing up so whenever I need a brush I
just<00:01:15.880> pull<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.360> out<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:18.190> know<00:01:19.830> basically

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
just pull it out and I know basically

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.150 
just pull it out and I know basically
more<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.300> put<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.540> back<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.650> keeps<00:01:23.920> it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
more to put it back in and it keeps it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.790 
more to put it back in and it keeps it
standing<00:01:24.730> up<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.120> it<00:01:25.210> keeps<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.600> separated<00:01:26.170> so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
standing up and it keeps it separated so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.070 
standing up and it keeps it separated so

makeup on really quickly it just makes
it<00:01:40.450> more<00:01:40.510> convenient<00:01:41.050> when<00:01:41.290> your<00:01:41.440> brushes<00:01:41.800> are

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
it more convenient when your brushes are

it more convenient when your brushes are
right<00:01:42.130> there<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:42.940> i<00:01:42.970> did<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.330> for<00:01:43.540> also<00:01:44.080> my

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
right there so i did that for also my

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.280 
right there so i did that for also my
eyeshadow<00:01:45.670> brushes<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.390> i<00:01:46.450> know<00:01:46.540> i<00:01:46.720> have<00:01:46.810> tons

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
eyeshadow brushes and i know i have tons

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.160 
eyeshadow brushes and i know i have tons
but<00:01:47.680> i<00:01:47.860> thought<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:48.520> can<00:01:48.670> never<00:01:48.910> have<00:01:49.390> more

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
but i thought you can never have more

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.230 
but i thought you can never have more
than<00:01:50.230> enough<00:01:50.530> eyeshadow<00:01:51.220> brushes<00:01:51.550> because

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
than enough eyeshadow brushes because

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.090 
than enough eyeshadow brushes because
they<00:01:52.540> also<00:01:52.720> have<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.140> different<00:01:53.470> purpose<00:01:53.710> when

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
they also have a different purpose when

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000 
they also have a different purpose when
applying<00:01:54.430> all<00:01:54.670> makeup<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:56.350> i<00:01:56.440> also<00:01:56.470> did<00:01:56.980> it

applying all makeup then i also did it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.100 
applying all makeup then i also did it

and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.140 
and
then<00:02:12.879> what<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> got<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.680> few<00:02:14.709> days<00:02:15.010> ago<00:02:15.250> was

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
then what I got just a few days ago was

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.229 
then what I got just a few days ago was
this<00:02:16.360> divider<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:18.159> basically<00:02:18.459> was<00:02:18.849> able<00:02:19.150> to

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
this divider and I basically was able to

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.710 
this divider and I basically was able to
split<00:02:19.569> all<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.989> my<00:02:20.170> pencils<00:02:20.739> up<00:02:20.920> my<00:02:21.340> liners<00:02:21.940> my

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
split all of my pencils up my liners my

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.869 
split all of my pencils up my liners my
mascara<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.709> then<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:25.830> eyeliners<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.489> it

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
mascara and then more eyeliners so it

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.210 
mascara and then more eyeliners so it
just<00:02:28.120> keeps<00:02:28.269> everything<00:02:28.540> organized<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.920> then

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
just keeps everything organized and then

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.640 
just keeps everything organized and then
to<00:02:30.400> top<00:02:30.640> everything<00:02:30.849> off<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:32.440> my

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.270 
to top everything off I have my
magnifying<00:02:33.280> mirror<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.989> very<00:02:35.319> very<00:02:35.410> good

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
magnifying mirror it is very very good

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
to have a magnifying mirror it really

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890

lighting<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.730> way<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.299> can

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
lighting to it so this way I can

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.559 
lighting to it so this way I can
basically<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.069> I'm<00:02:45.190> doing<00:02:45.670> because<00:02:46.269> you

can having a lot of light actually helps

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.740 
can having a lot of light actually helps
with<00:02:49.989> blending<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:52.000> certain<00:02:52.390> areas

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750
