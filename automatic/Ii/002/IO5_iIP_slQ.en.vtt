 for a customization test with 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 only car to distinguish without 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.250
 problem years exactly what brands 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.710
 a little bit just this one because 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.510
 it's an exceptional car 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 for my part I find it super beautiful 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.170
 personalized so do not hesitate to me 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.149

 the comments towards the end is what 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.760
 do I custom goods is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.770
 what is beautiful is not bruce and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 means no I tease no but is it 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 that frankly the car she is well 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.039
 represented by all by all 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.020
 customization features in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.239
 unblocks to measure the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.590
 of the game look good old nails of a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.329
 little bit there but lyon has bottom I put 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.289
 the husband I want to really put something 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.940
 of crazy all I'm going to try to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.290
 do my ya paintings that hangs 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.920
 a lot more to other cars 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.869
 much less 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 my name I will take a color that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.950
 I have not taken yet knowing that in fact 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.780
 each car is of course different 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 according to the painting there are reliefs 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.600
 according to the cars you go to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 have in your hands so for me 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.759
 I prefer it's there to this one I 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.210
 is too stylish and finds it 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210
 very good 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 now we will change a little bit 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.020
 the other stuff 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 here's the team provided a framework like 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.270
 I explained to you I would not take 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.860
 necessarily the most expensive items 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.240
 but I will take the most beautiful like that 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.100
 it will just allow me to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.450
 customize the car and I'm going 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.560
 test after on circuit for those who 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.000
 know that the procedure you are going 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.700

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.490
 car like that you're forced to take 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.520
 points of the high-end wheels even 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.660

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.800
 doubles to do this 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.660
 customization of ice and cars 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.930
 my dream really the names of the game in 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.760
 made since the car is not called 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.350
 not audi she's called differently if 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.700
 for those who do not believe me there is a 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.010
 catalog at the bottom of the description 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.590
 of my videos you click I have all the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.170
 gta cars so that's for sure and it's 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.730
 as simple as that is after I 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.530
 know it can be or said that can 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.390
 to be bm is called called mercedes of 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.470
 ferrari lamborghini but not his door 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.850
 really the same name so me I them 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.269
 calls with the abbreviation of the game in 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.840
 done here's the car out to 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.090
 outdoors 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.810
 she is not beautiful this car 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.209
 look at that look with the reflection 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.640
 of the sun and I find it super rebel 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.989
 for my part I think it's one 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.470
 most beautiful for the moment priest I 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.600
 tested so what do you think 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.860
 and warns them especially this painting 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.730
 me who makes me love me this is the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.190
 painting actually dark blue with 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.330
 yellow and it's super well married so the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.530
 color combination she is 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.060
 really not bad and still a little 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.220
 novelty for those who have not seen aa 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.030
 for those who do not see it what is 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.980
 I could m 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.510
 well, in fact, blue erasers at each 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.959
 times that my wheels actually I'm going to do 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.040
 burn 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.900
 I really found with blues 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.690
 rubles 3 but now for the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.790
 airports test for speed pointed 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.069
 magnificent performance no 1 1 left 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.690
 leave does not start a little skid 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.739
 she is beautiful this piece is that 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.270
 I laughed too much what is it 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.250
 can do with this kind of game let 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.780
 parties speed up and let's go no 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.330
 do not hesitate to tell me really if you 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.290
 also you tested this car there 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.090
 is she good or not good 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.500
 because others may actually be that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.180
 you are not necessarily falling on it 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.410
 or doubt people who start or six 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.000
 urgent states that have not yet seen the 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.930
 car so do not hesitate to come to me 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.400
 really what you think 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.510
 do you like her or she 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.769
 not like or does it hold up well 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.300
 the road and what it catches at the 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.750
 not crooked debate in the 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.150
 comments 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.260
 and see me this top speed 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.250
 after I lose it so she holds 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.720
 really well the road between two 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.380
 Car 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.380
 for me in any case 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.380
 look at me this effect that made me 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.040
 Too much fun I almost crashed 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.140
 of plane than live because of my kid 1 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.180
 because of my car celebrating summer this 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.490
 performant I went broke what all 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.830
 just the car I said no 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.240
 how is this bullshit 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.040
 really not bad the two planes that get 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.480
 hitting limit it would have been really 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.970
 not bad for my little gameplay there in 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.290
 Live it happens to you that allowed you to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.300
 to see frankly that the car they 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.150
 have cleared the most she has a lot of 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.620
 performance I find so I use 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.090
 several magazines also one for you 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.410
 can also see views embed 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:02.610
 lives of the helicopter ralala a 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:07.260
 fury this car is a killing that 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.750
 to say that to say nothing better I swear to you 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.910
 these cars there I find it super already 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.740
 that the color attracts me it makes a 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.840
 super nice color same time i find 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.670
 that she has a turbo but a power you 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.620
 can not imagine how good it is not one 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.910
 the fastest game that's for sure but 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.440
 she does not stick far I 'll tell her he 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.620
 is part of the top 3 fights start 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.970
 largely m of top 2 same sekai no 2 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.470
 moneyweek watchers a little more powerful 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.450
 that this one is not necessarily the 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.950
 bugatti veyron was not coming to us from 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.110
