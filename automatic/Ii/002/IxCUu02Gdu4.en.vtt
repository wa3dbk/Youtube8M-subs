get to the end take a little bit of
weight<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> board<00:01:10.439> which<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> sort

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
weight off the board which then you sort

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
weight off the board which then you sort
of<00:01:11.729> Olivia<00:01:12.270> lightweight<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> split<00:01:13.229> second

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
of Olivia lightweight for a split second

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
of Olivia lightweight for a split second
as<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.979> board<00:01:14.250> drops<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> end<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.720 
need to do an appropriate Ollie to it so
if<00:02:29.650> it's<00:02:29.800> something<00:02:30.010> that's<00:02:30.250> got<00:02:30.460> too<00:02:30.580> high

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
if it's something that's got too high

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.180 
if it's something that's got too high
you<00:02:31.000> don't<00:02:31.210> ollie<00:02:31.510> knee-high<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.920> because

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
you don't ollie knee-high to it because

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.740 
you don't ollie knee-high to it because
the<00:02:33.340> impact<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.880> be<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.030> lot<00:02:34.270> more<00:02:34.300> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
the impact is going to be a lot more and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.880 
the impact is going to be a lot more and
it's<00:02:34.840> going<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.050> make<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.440> trick<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> lot

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
it's going to make the trick a lot

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's going to make the trick a lot
harder<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.850> nice<00:02:37.180> appropriate<00:02:38.280> streamline

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
harder so a nice appropriate streamline

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.840 
harder so a nice appropriate streamline
Ollie<00:02:39.640> into<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.240> manual<00:02:40.600> no<00:02:41.410> problems<00:02:41.920> now

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
Ollie into the manual no problems now

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.280 
Ollie into the manual no problems now
once<00:02:43.060> you've<00:02:43.270> got<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.990> want<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.200> do

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
once you've got that and you want to do

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.410 
once you've got that and you want to do
some<00:02:44.470> variations<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.760> could<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.120> start

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
some variations you could then start

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.220 
some variations you could then start
doing<00:02:46.600> some<00:02:46.960> flip<00:02:47.260> into<00:02:47.470> manuals<00:02:48.180> or<00:02:49.180> flip<00:02:50.050> out

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
doing some flip into manuals or flip out

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.400 
doing some flip into manuals or flip out
of<00:02:50.350> manuals<00:02:54.360> once<00:02:55.360> you've<00:02:55.510> got<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> few<00:02:55.960> regular

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
of manuals once you've got a few regular

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.440 
of manuals once you've got a few regular
variations<00:02:57.040> then<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.520> go<00:02:57.640> switch<00:02:58.060> so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
variations then you can go switch so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.830 
variations then you can go switch so
switch<00:02:58.780> manual<00:02:59.260> will<00:02:59.740> switch<00:03:00.010> nose<00:03:00.310> manual

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
switch manual will switch nose manual

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.760 
switch manual will switch nose manual
now<00:03:01.840> once<00:03:02.080> you're<00:03:02.230> getting<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.470> little<00:03:02.650> bit

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
now once you're getting a little bit

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.890 
now once you're getting a little bit
better<00:03:03.030> there's<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.120> few<00:03:04.360> other<00:03:04.510> tricks<00:03:04.690> that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
better there's a few other tricks that

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.000 
better there's a few other tricks that
you<00:03:04.960> could<00:03:05.050> do<00:03:05.200> something<00:03:05.470> like<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.710> nose

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
you could do something like a nose

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.660 
you could do something like a nose
manual<00:03:06.220> 180<00:03:06.730> or<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.090> nose<00:03:07.690> manual<00:03:07.870> shove<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
manual 180 or a nose manual shove and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.220 
manual 180 or a nose manual shove and
then<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.000> would<00:03:10.150> say<00:03:10.360> something<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.050> once

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
then I would say something that once

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.450 
then I would say something that once
you're<00:03:11.380> really<00:03:11.680> confident<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.340> you're

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
you're really confident and you're

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.010 
you're really confident and you're
comfortable<00:03:12.790> with<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.270> trick<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.600> can<00:03:13.750> start

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
comfortable with the trick you can start

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.560 
comfortable with the trick you can start
doing<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.470> nollie<00:03:14.800> flips<00:03:15.160> out<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:16.390> main

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
doing like a nollie flips out the main

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.510 
doing like a nollie flips out the main
thing<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.960> is<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.620> practice<00:03:17.830> there's<00:03:18.280> so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
thing is is just to practice there's so

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.310 
thing is is just to practice there's so
many<00:03:18.610> variations<00:03:19.000> out<00:03:19.390> that<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.780> do<00:03:19.960> have

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
many variations out that you can do have

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.380 
many variations out that you can do have
fun<00:03:20.620> with<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> trick<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.430> I'll<00:03:21.910> be<00:03:22.060> catching

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
fun with the trick and I'll be catching

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.140 
fun with the trick and I'll be catching
you<00:03:22.480> next<00:03:22.720> time

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
you next time

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:31.340
