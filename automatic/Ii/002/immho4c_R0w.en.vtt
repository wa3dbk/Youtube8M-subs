you also have a four wheeler and I'll be
honest<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> four<00:00:28.109> wheeler

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
honest I really like that four wheeler

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.529 
honest I really like that four wheeler
but<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> other<00:00:29.970> two<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.359> really

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
but I do think the other two are really

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.999 
but I do think the other two are really
good<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> oftentimes<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.650> can't<00:00:31.859> really

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
good and oftentimes you can't really

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.290 
good and oftentimes you can't really
tell<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.790> until<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.149> actually

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
tell what you like until you actually

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
tell what you like until you actually
build<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.649> gonna<00:00:34.770> do

perfect for this I like the use of the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.549 
perfect for this I like the use of the
gentle<00:00:54.329> slope<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> goes<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> create<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
gentle slope that goes up to create the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
gentle slope that goes up to create the
main<00:00:55.710> body<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> nice<00:00:57.000> wing<00:00:57.270> on

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the front that uses a couple of slopes

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
the front that uses a couple of slopes
and<00:00:59.129> some<00:00:59.280> flat<00:00:59.489> pieces<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.120> give<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> some

on a Technic piece that allows for the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250 
on a Technic piece that allows for the
tires<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:12.180> spin<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:13.020> you're<00:01:13.140> done

tires actually spin so when you're done
building<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.950> creates<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
building this it creates a lot of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.679 
building this it creates a lot of
playability<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> actually

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
playability because you can actually

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.410 
playability because you can actually
drive<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> thing<00:01:16.680> around<00:01:17.100> afterwards<00:01:17.610> going

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
drive this thing around afterwards going

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.700 
drive this thing around afterwards going
back<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> car<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.409> there's<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
very tight and cramped there's not a lot
of<00:01:29.250> space<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
of space that you would actually put a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
of space that you would actually put a
driver<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.860> redeeming<00:01:32.250> factor<00:01:32.670> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
driver in the one redeeming factor is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
driver in the one redeeming factor is
the<00:01:33.060> fact<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.600> there's<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.900> steering<00:01:34.259> wheel

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the fact that there's a steering wheel

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.950 
the fact that there's a steering wheel
here<00:01:34.590> which<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.750> movable<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here which is actually movable and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
here which is actually movable and
that's<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> nice<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.070> tilt<00:01:38.579> steering

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that's kind of nice it has tilt steering

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's kind of nice it has tilt steering
but<00:01:39.390> inside<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.829> small<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
but inside you can see very small on the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.359 
but inside you can see very small on the
side<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
side it looks really good this is this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.219 
side it looks really good this is this
is<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.850> great<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.329> accurate<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
is really great and accurate to what a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
is really great and accurate to what a
normal<00:01:46.380> f1<00:01:46.799> car<00:01:47.009> looks<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.880> gentle

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
normal f1 car looks like with the gentle

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060 
normal f1 car looks like with the gentle
slope<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.020> goes<00:01:49.170> around<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> create<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
slope that goes around here to create a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800 
slope that goes around here to create a
nice<00:01:50.250> shape<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> body<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.600> right

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
nice shape for the body and then right

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.210 
nice shape for the body and then right
above<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.200> you'll<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.740> there's<00:01:52.979> some

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
above that you'll see that there's some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
above that you'll see that there's some
small<00:01:53.790> side<00:01:54.060> mirrors<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.229> give<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
small side mirrors which I think give it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
small side mirrors which I think give it
a<00:01:55.500> nice<00:01:55.649> little<00:01:55.860> detail<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.820> look

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
a nice little detail and really look

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.850 
a nice little detail and really look
good<00:01:57.210> from<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> front<00:01:57.719> further<00:01:58.439> back<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
good from the front further back in the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
good from the front further back in the
car<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.460> there's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> red<00:01:59.909> air<00:02:00.090> scoop

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
car you can see there's a red air scoop

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
car you can see there's a red air scoop
and<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> use<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.799> slants

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and I really like the use of the slants

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
and I really like the use of the slants
and<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.909> small<00:02:03.299> pieces<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.140> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and the small pieces they use there to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.630 
and the small pieces they use there to
create<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.560> cavity<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.280> air<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.610> go

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
create a cavity for the air to go

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.639 
create a cavity for the air to go
through<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> body

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
through and then you can see the body

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.589 
through and then you can see the body
kind<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.099> fins<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.209> goes<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:09.569> with

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
kind of fins out as it goes back with

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.260 
kind of fins out as it goes back with
these<00:02:10.050> white<00:02:10.259> pieces<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> then<00:02:12.060> moving

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
these white pieces here and then moving

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.490 
these white pieces here and then moving
further<00:02:12.599> back

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
further back

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.750 
further back
there's<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.740> really<00:02:13.950> nice<00:02:14.160> wing<00:02:14.460> on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.670> back

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
there's a really nice wing on the back

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.180 
there's a really nice wing on the back
of<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.300> vehicle<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.260> slopes<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:17.040> up

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
of the vehicle you have slopes going up

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.650 
of the vehicle you have slopes going up
here<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.490> fact<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.880> whole<00:02:18.060> back<00:02:18.240> end<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
here in fact this whole back end is

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.690 
here in fact this whole back end is
basically<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.230> slopes<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.160> see<00:02:20.340> slopes

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
basically just slopes you can see slopes

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.460 
basically just slopes you can see slopes
everywhere<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.780> got<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> slope<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> goes

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
everywhere you got the slope that goes

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.600 
everywhere you got the slope that goes
up<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:22.800> with<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.950> flat<00:02:23.070> piece<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.520> goes

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
up here with a flat piece that goes

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.160 
up here with a flat piece that goes
across<00:02:23.760> great<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> top<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> wing<00:02:24.900> and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
across great the top of the wing and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.660 
across great the top of the wing and
then<00:02:25.470> there's<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.710> white<00:02:25.920> slope<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> back

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
then there's a white slope on the back

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.700 
then there's a white slope on the back
the<00:02:27.390> tires<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.960> back<00:02:28.020> are<00:02:28.350> set<00:02:28.530> up<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the tires in the back are set up the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.740 
the tires in the back are set up the
same<00:02:28.920> way<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.700> front<00:02:29.850> with<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> axle

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
same way as the front with the axle

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.090 
same way as the front with the axle
inside<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.830> look<00:02:31.950> at

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
inside so you can get a good look at

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.980 
inside so you can get a good look at
that<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.520> they<00:02:32.820> also<00:02:33.030> spend<00:02:33.570> through<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> use

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
that and they also spend through the use

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.360 
that and they also spend through the use
of<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.200> Technic<00:02:34.530> pieces<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:35.040> like<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
of the Technic pieces just like the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.340 
of the Technic pieces just like the
front<00:02:35.550> here's<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.060> view<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> back<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.230> can

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
front here's a view of the back you can

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.600 
front here's a view of the back you can
see<00:02:37.410> all<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.830> slopes<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.220> how<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.459> come

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
see all the slopes and how they come

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.010 
see all the slopes and how they come
together<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> backend<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.660> actually

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
together in the backend this actually

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.690 
together in the backend this actually
looks<00:02:40.200> pretty<00:02:40.290> good<00:02:40.770> for<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> pretty<00:02:41.370> simple

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
looks pretty good for a pretty simple

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.150 
looks pretty good for a pretty simple
creator<00:02:42.570> build<00:02:42.840> there's<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.500> small<00:02:43.770> tail<00:02:43.950> light

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
creator build there's a small tail light

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.430 
creator build there's a small tail light
in<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> back<00:02:44.610> which<00:02:44.850> looks<00:02:44.989> fairly<00:02:45.989> accurate

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
in the back which looks fairly accurate

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
in the back which looks fairly accurate
to<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.770> normal<00:02:47.070> f1<00:02:47.580> car<00:02:47.790> would<00:02:48.030> look<00:02:48.060> like

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
to what a normal f1 car would look like

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
to what a normal f1 car would look like
and<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.930> have<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.380> multitude<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.890> colors<00:02:50.100> in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and you have a multitude of colors in

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.280 
and you have a multitude of colors in
the<00:02:50.459> back<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.300> gives<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:51.900> bit<00:02:52.140> of

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the back so it gives a little bit of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.020 
the back so it gives a little bit of
depth<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.010> white<00:02:53.250> you've<00:02:53.700> got<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
depth you have the white you've got the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.580 
depth you have the white you've got the
black<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.660> yellow<00:02:54.690> which<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.410> looks

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
black and the yellow which I think looks

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.199 
black and the yellow which I think looks
pretty<00:02:55.860> good<00:02:56.010> bottom<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> build<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
pretty good bottom the build in the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.390 
pretty good bottom the build in the
frame<00:02:57.450> pretty<00:02:58.050> simple<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.770> amazing<00:02:59.220> how

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
frame pretty simple it's amazing how

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.800 
frame pretty simple it's amazing how
simple<00:02:59.730> these<00:03:00.000> things<00:03:00.239> start<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.750> how

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
simple these things start out and how

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.110 
simple these things start out and how
complex<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.500> actually<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.340> create<00:03:02.880> what

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
complex they actually get to create what

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
complex they actually get to create what
you're<00:03:03.270> trying<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.630> build<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.410> from<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
you're trying to build so from the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.130 
you're trying to build so from the
bottom<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.340> looks<00:03:05.520> super<00:03:05.790> basic<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.570> then

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
bottom it looks super basic and then

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.680 
bottom it looks super basic and then
once<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> get<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.709> top<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.190> very<00:03:08.970> nice<00:03:09.390> build

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
once you get the top a very nice build

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.080 
once you get the top a very nice build
I'm<00:03:09.959> very<00:03:10.170> happy<00:03:10.590> with<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:11.040> Formula<00:03:11.700> One<00:03:11.850> car

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
I'm very happy with this Formula One car

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.090 
I'm very happy with this Formula One car
and<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.690> fact<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.140> my<00:03:13.170> second<00:03:13.620> Formula

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
and in fact this is my second Formula

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.410 
and in fact this is my second Formula
One<00:03:14.220> car<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.520> I've<00:03:14.610> built<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.120> channel

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
One car that I've built on this channel

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
One car that I've built on this channel
I<00:03:15.690> actually<00:03:16.080> had<00:03:16.380> built<00:03:16.620> another<00:03:16.830> one<00:03:16.920> using

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
I actually had built another one using

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.640 
I actually had built another one using
very<00:03:17.459> simple<00:03:17.760> pieces<00:03:18.060> from<00:03:18.900> another<00:03:19.170> build

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
very simple pieces from another build

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.170 
very simple pieces from another build
that<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:19.860> had<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.700> thing<00:03:20.910> turned<00:03:21.120> out

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that I had and that thing turned out

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.180 
that I had and that thing turned out
nice<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.780> thing<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.650> great

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
nice but this thing is just great

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.280 
nice but this thing is just great
so<00:03:23.580> we've<00:03:24.180> take<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> look<00:03:24.720> at<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.140> next

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
so we've take a look at this and next

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.229 
so we've take a look at this and next
we're<00:03:25.500> gonna<00:03:25.590> take<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> look<00:03:26.160> at<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.760> go-kart

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
we're gonna take a look at the go-kart

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.240 
we're gonna take a look at the go-kart
here's<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.290> go-kart<00:03:28.680> fully<00:03:28.860> built

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
here's the go-kart fully built

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.310 
here's the go-kart fully built
I<00:03:29.370> think<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.150> set<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.450> actually<00:03:30.840> better<00:03:30.989> than

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
I think this set is actually better than

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.840 
I think this set is actually better than
the<00:03:31.380> Formula<00:03:31.830> One<00:03:31.950> racecar<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.430> think<00:03:32.640> they<00:03:32.730> did

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
the Formula One racecar I think they did

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.160 
the Formula One racecar I think they did
a<00:03:32.880> really<00:03:33.060> good<00:03:33.269> job<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.540> showing<00:03:33.720> what<00:03:34.140> a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
a really good job of showing what a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.750 
a really good job of showing what a
go-kart<00:03:34.620> looks<00:03:34.799> like<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.220> what<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:35.580> of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
go-kart looks like and what you think of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.699 
go-kart looks like and what you think of
in<00:03:35.880> your<00:03:36.000> mind<00:03:36.180> for<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.540> go-kart<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
in your mind for a go-kart I like the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.680 
in your mind for a go-kart I like the
use<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.980> color<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:39.060> think<00:03:39.330> there's<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.540> lot

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
use of color and I think there's a lot

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.420 
use of color and I think there's a lot
of<00:03:39.720> great<00:03:39.930> elements<00:03:40.350> on<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.070> let's<00:03:41.100> take

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
of great elements on this so let's take

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.220 
of great elements on this so let's take
a<00:03:41.459> closer<00:03:41.670> look<00:03:41.790> at<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.180> from<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.959> front<00:03:42.989> you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
a closer look at it from the front you

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.900 
a closer look at it from the front you
can<00:03:43.380> see<00:03:43.500> there's<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.739> really<00:03:43.950> nice<00:03:44.100> profile<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
can see there's a really nice profile to

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.240 
can see there's a really nice profile to
it<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.180> love<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> bumper<00:03:46.320> way<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.890> curves

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
it I love the bumper way it curves

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.830 
it I love the bumper way it curves
around<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> front<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.630> really

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
around like that on the front it really

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.270 
around like that on the front it really
shows<00:03:49.079> what<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.560> would<00:03:49.680> see<00:03:49.860> if<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.010> went<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
shows what you would see if you went to

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.650 
shows what you would see if you went to
a<00:03:50.340> go-kart<00:03:50.760> track<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.180> we're<00:03:51.269> bumping<00:03:51.450> around

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
a go-kart track and we're bumping around

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.630 
a go-kart track and we're bumping around
with<00:03:51.780> other<00:03:51.900> cars<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.890> width<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.459> is

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
with other cars the width of it is

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.819 
with other cars the width of it is
really<00:03:54.209> great<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.959> think<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.320> scale<00:03:55.590> is

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
really great and I think the scale is

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.620 
really great and I think the scale is
perfect<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.610> way<00:03:56.760> they<00:03:56.880> made<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> seat<00:03:57.360> very

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
perfect the way they made the seat very

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.479 
perfect the way they made the seat very
big<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.350> see<00:03:58.380> maybe<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.950> person<00:03:59.310> sitting

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
big you can see maybe a person sitting

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.860 
big you can see maybe a person sitting
inside<00:03:59.670> that<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.120> obviously<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.720> in

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
inside that this obviously is in

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.319 
inside that this obviously is in
minifigure<00:04:01.350> scale<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:03.030> would<00:04:03.209> look

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
minifigure scale but it would look

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.479 
minifigure scale but it would look
really<00:04:03.570> nice<00:04:03.720> for<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:04.049> display<00:04:04.380> moving<00:04:05.190> on<00:04:05.280> to

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
really nice for a display moving on to

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.180 
really nice for a display moving on to
the<00:04:05.610> side<00:04:05.820> they<00:04:06.630> use<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> same<00:04:07.470> style<00:04:08.100> that

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
the side they use the same style that

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.949 
the side they use the same style that
they<00:04:08.400> used<00:04:08.610> on<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.970> Formula<00:04:09.269> One<00:04:09.299> racecar<00:04:09.600> by

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
they used on the Formula One racecar by

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.210 
they used on the Formula One racecar by
putting<00:04:10.230> these<00:04:10.350> pieces<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.829> side<00:04:11.070> and

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
putting these pieces on the side and

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.650 
putting these pieces on the side and
kind<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.430> having<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.790> pieces<00:04:12.060> facing<00:04:12.390> outward

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
kind of having the pieces facing outward

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.979 
kind of having the pieces facing outward
this<00:04:12.840> way<00:04:13.049> as<00:04:13.230> opposed<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.739> up<00:04:14.010> or<00:04:14.220> down<00:04:14.400> and

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
this way as opposed to up or down and

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.020 
this way as opposed to up or down and
you<00:04:15.989> can<00:04:16.140> see<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.410> cockpit<00:04:16.620> inside<00:04:17.160> it's<00:04:17.850> got

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you can see the cockpit inside it's got

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.180 
you can see the cockpit inside it's got
a<00:04:18.060> nice<00:04:18.239> spot<00:04:18.540> for<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> driver<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.200> sit<00:04:19.470> with<00:04:19.859> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
a nice spot for a driver to sit with the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.790 
a nice spot for a driver to sit with the
different<00:04:20.519> materials<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.359> back<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.900> this

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
different materials on the back and this

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.350 
different materials on the back and this
tilt<00:04:23.250> steering<00:04:23.430> wheel<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.880> like<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
tilt steering wheel just like on the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.900 
tilt steering wheel just like on the
Formula<00:04:24.750> One<00:04:24.870> racecar<00:04:25.160> on<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.430> back<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.760> can

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
Formula One racecar on the back you can

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.290 
Formula One racecar on the back you can
see<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
see the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.670 
see the
for<00:04:27.389> an<00:04:27.449> element's<00:04:27.810> with<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.080> engine<00:04:28.500> and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
for an element's with the engine and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.589 
for an element's with the engine and
also<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> tail<00:04:29.550> way<00:04:29.729> they<00:04:29.909> use<00:04:30.060> sort<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.509> the

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
also the tail way they use sort of the

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.719 
also the tail way they use sort of the
same<00:04:30.810> style<00:04:31.169> as<00:04:31.379> what<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.919> Formula<00:04:32.370> One<00:04:32.520> car

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
same style as what the Formula One car

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.300 
same style as what the Formula One car
did<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.599> uses<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.990> same<00:04:34.199> axle<00:04:34.770> pattern<00:04:35.099> as

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
did and it uses the same axle pattern as

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.159 
did and it uses the same axle pattern as
the<00:04:35.340> Formula<00:04:35.940> One<00:04:36.030> racecar<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:36.720> it's<00:04:36.870> about

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
the Formula One racecar so it's about

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.930 
the Formula One racecar so it's about
the<00:04:37.349> same<00:04:37.379> size<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.069> is<00:04:38.129> just<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.520> little<00:04:38.759> bit

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
the same size this is just a little bit

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.180 
the same size this is just a little bit
more<00:04:39.120> narrow<00:04:39.360> we'll<00:04:40.199> take<00:04:40.349> a<00:04:40.379> closer<00:04:40.680> look<00:04:40.949> at

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
more narrow we'll take a closer look at

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.399 
more narrow we'll take a closer look at
the<00:04:41.340> engine<00:04:41.729> there<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.539> can<00:04:42.690> see<00:04:42.930> how<00:04:43.169> nice

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
the engine there you can see how nice

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:44.749 
the engine there you can see how nice
that<00:04:43.650> looks<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:44.099> think<00:04:44.129> they<00:04:44.370> did<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> good<00:04:44.699> job

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
that looks I think they did a good job

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.270 
that looks I think they did a good job
with<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:46.080> exhaust<00:04:46.560> coming<00:04:46.889> out<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.129> back

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
with the exhaust coming out of the back

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.089 
with the exhaust coming out of the back
and<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:48.300> slants<00:04:49.080> going<00:04:49.289> up<00:04:49.409> on<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.650> top<00:04:49.860> this

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
and the slants going up on the top this

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.740 
and the slants going up on the top this
one<00:04:50.280> uses<00:04:50.580> far<00:04:50.729> less<00:04:50.789> slants<00:04:51.330> than<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.599> other

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
one uses far less slants than the other

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.439 
one uses far less slants than the other
said<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.199> seems<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.710> then<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:54.030> other<00:04:54.150> side

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
said it seems and then the other side

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.809 
said it seems and then the other side
this<00:04:54.659> you've<00:04:55.169> seen<00:04:55.409> in<00:04:55.560> profile<00:04:56.039> how<00:04:56.340> long<00:04:56.610> it

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
this you've seen in profile how long it

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.089 
this you've seen in profile how long it
is<00:04:56.849> and<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.629> how<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.930> looks<00:04:57.960> with<00:04:58.379> the<00:04:58.409> tires

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
is and just how it looks with the tires

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.040 
is and just how it looks with the tires
they<00:04:59.460> kind<00:04:59.669> of<00:04:59.729> buck<00:05:00.000> up<00:05:00.180> against<00:05:00.569> the<00:05:00.750> bumpers

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
they kind of buck up against the bumpers

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.629 
they kind of buck up against the bumpers
on<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.289> front<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.710> back<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.129> this<00:05:02.219> has<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.400> back

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
on the front and back so this has a back

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.790 
on the front and back so this has a back
bumper<00:05:02.969> that's<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.629> the<00:05:03.780> front<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.500> I

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
bumper that's just like the front and I

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.110 
bumper that's just like the front and I
think<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:05.129> looks<00:05:05.340> pretty<00:05:05.400> good<00:05:05.759> the<00:05:05.879> way<00:05:05.969> it

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
think that looks pretty good the way it

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.980 
think that looks pretty good the way it
is<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:07.009> finally<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.129> bottom<00:05:08.539> here<00:05:09.539> is<00:05:09.569> the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
is and finally the bottom here is the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.600 
is and finally the bottom here is the
same<00:05:10.199> frame<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.860> would<00:05:10.979> find<00:05:11.219> on<00:05:11.460> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
same frame that you would find on the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.820 
same frame that you would find on the
Formula<00:05:11.909> One<00:05:11.940> car<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.569> it's<00:05:13.080> well<00:05:13.289> done<00:05:13.469> here

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
Formula One car and it's well done here

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.010 
Formula One car and it's well done here
and<00:05:13.979> creates<00:05:14.669> a<00:05:14.759> really<00:05:14.879> nice<00:05:15.120> element<00:05:15.719> for

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
and creates a really nice element for

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.020 
and creates a really nice element for
what<00:05:16.830> you'd<00:05:16.979> build<00:05:17.159> on<00:05:17.280> top<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.669> it's<00:05:17.909> a

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
what you'd build on top of it it's a

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.580 
what you'd build on top of it it's a
really<00:05:18.270> nice<00:05:18.419> formula<00:05:18.750> or<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.020> really<00:05:19.469> nice

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
really nice formula or a really nice

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.930 
really nice formula or a really nice
go-kart<00:05:20.069> and<00:05:20.219> I<00:05:20.250> think<00:05:20.460> they<00:05:20.550> did<00:05:20.669> a<00:05:20.699> great<00:05:20.849> job

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
go-kart and I think they did a great job

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.089 
go-kart and I think they did a great job
with<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.449> so<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.229> final<00:05:22.620> build<00:05:22.800> we'll<00:05:22.949> take<00:05:23.069> a

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
with it so the final build we'll take a

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.670 
with it so the final build we'll take a
look<00:05:23.340> at<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.819> ATV<00:05:24.419> or<00:05:24.449> four-wheeler<00:05:25.110> here's

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
look at the ATV or four-wheeler here's

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.559 
look at the ATV or four-wheeler here's
the<00:05:25.830> ATV<00:05:26.219> which<00:05:26.400> is<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.669> final<00:05:26.969> build<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.479> in

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
the ATV which is the final build and in

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.540 
the ATV which is the final build and in
my<00:05:27.719> opinion<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.379> the<00:05:28.500> weakest<00:05:29.039> build<00:05:29.280> I

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
my opinion it's the weakest build I

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.129 
my opinion it's the weakest build I
really<00:05:30.000> thought<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.300> ATV<00:05:30.599> was<00:05:30.780> gonna<00:05:30.870> be<00:05:31.020> my

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
really thought the ATV was gonna be my

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.779 
really thought the ATV was gonna be my
favorite<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.830> three<00:05:32.039> when<00:05:32.219> I<00:05:32.250> saw<00:05:32.490> this<00:05:32.610> I

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
favorite of the three when I saw this I

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.010 
favorite of the three when I saw this I
was<00:05:32.819> like<00:05:32.909> god<00:05:33.150> I'd<00:05:33.270> be<00:05:33.389> really<00:05:33.569> cool<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.900> make

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
was like god I'd be really cool to make

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.080 
was like god I'd be really cool to make
an<00:05:34.139> ATV<00:05:34.590> but<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.159> really<00:05:35.550> don't<00:05:35.759> like<00:05:35.880> the

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
an ATV but I really don't like the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.149 
an ATV but I really don't like the
stance<00:05:36.419> of<00:05:36.599> it<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:36.870> feel<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.139> it's<00:05:37.740> way<00:05:38.099> too

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
stance of it I feel like it's way too

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.040 
stance of it I feel like it's way too
wide<00:05:38.669> and<00:05:39.029> I<00:05:39.090> know<00:05:39.150> they<00:05:39.360> had<00:05:39.539> to<00:05:39.690> make<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
wide and I know they had to make the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.420 
wide and I know they had to make the
tires<00:05:40.409> as<00:05:40.680> wide<00:05:40.830> as<00:05:40.979> they<00:05:41.130> are<00:05:41.219> because

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
tires as wide as they are because

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.010 
tires as wide as they are because
they're<00:05:41.669> using<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:41.969> same<00:05:42.060> axles<00:05:42.630> for<00:05:42.810> all<00:05:42.900> the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
they're using the same axles for all the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.749 
they're using the same axles for all the
builds<00:05:43.319> but<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.919> really<00:05:44.159> doesn't<00:05:44.460> look<00:05:44.520> good

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
builds but it really doesn't look good

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.089 
builds but it really doesn't look good
in<00:05:44.880> proportion<00:05:45.419> with<00:05:45.449> the<00:05:46.080> ATV<00:05:46.380> itself<00:05:46.919> it's

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
in proportion with the ATV itself it's

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.100 
in proportion with the ATV itself it's
just<00:05:47.279> too<00:05:47.430> wide<00:05:47.669> and<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.120> also<00:05:48.300> sits<00:05:48.690> too<00:05:48.900> low

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
just too wide and it also sits too low

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.019 
just too wide and it also sits too low
you<00:05:49.710> can<00:05:49.860> see<00:05:50.009> from<00:05:50.159> the<00:05:50.250> side<00:05:50.460> just<00:05:50.639> how<00:05:50.789> low

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
you can see from the side just how low

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.550 
you can see from the side just how low
it<00:05:51.180> is

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
it is

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.899 
it is
III<00:05:52.560> put<00:05:52.919> your<00:05:53.069> Nate<00:05:53.190> he<00:05:53.310> be<00:05:53.460> sitting<00:05:53.699> up<00:05:53.849> a

III put your Nate he be sitting up a
little<00:05:54.090> bit<00:05:54.180> higher<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:54.719> having<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:55.380> narrow

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
little bit higher and having a narrow

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.339 
little bit higher and having a narrow
real<00:05:56.250> wheelbase<00:05:56.819> I<00:05:57.180> don't<00:05:57.569> like<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.870> back<00:05:58.050> how

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
real wheelbase I don't like the back how

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.529 
real wheelbase I don't like the back how
the<00:05:58.699> taillights<00:05:59.699> are<00:05:59.879> here<00:06:00.029> I<00:06:00.060> kind<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.389> feel

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
the taillights are here I kind of feel

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.360 
the taillights are here I kind of feel
like<00:06:00.569> this<00:06:00.810> should<00:06:00.930> be<00:06:00.990> down<00:06:01.169> here<00:06:01.199> like<00:06:02.159> the

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
like this should be down here like the

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.040 
like this should be down here like the
other<00:06:02.520> ATV<00:06:02.849> that<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.180> built<00:06:03.419> for<00:06:03.599> this<00:06:03.659> channel

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
other ATV that I built for this channel

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.219 
other ATV that I built for this channel
the<00:06:04.560> top<00:06:05.550> of<00:06:05.729> it<00:06:05.849> looks<00:06:06.120> fine<00:06:06.419> I<00:06:06.449> like<00:06:06.779> this<00:06:06.930> set

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
the top of it looks fine I like this set

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.990 
the top of it looks fine I like this set
back<00:06:07.409> here<00:06:07.770> and<00:06:07.949> I<00:06:08.009> like<00:06:08.279> how<00:06:08.430> you<00:06:08.490> have<00:06:08.669> the

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
back here and I like how you have the

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.309 
back here and I like how you have the
fenders<00:06:09.300> going<00:06:09.599> up<00:06:09.690> through<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:09.930> front<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.229> I

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
fenders going up through the front and I

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.589 
fenders going up through the front and I
like<00:06:10.349> that<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:11.729> headlight<00:06:12.029> on<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.240> front<00:06:12.449> but

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
like that the headlight on the front but

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.649 
like that the headlight on the front but
I<00:06:12.629> don't<00:06:12.990> like<00:06:13.229> the<00:06:13.969> handlebars<00:06:14.969> that<00:06:15.090> much<00:06:15.479> I

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
I don't like the handlebars that much I

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.570 
I don't like the handlebars that much I
think<00:06:15.719> they<00:06:15.990> did<00:06:16.680> okay<00:06:16.979> with<00:06:17.159> what<00:06:17.310> they<00:06:17.400> had

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
think they did okay with what they had

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.600 
think they did okay with what they had
but<00:06:17.819> it's<00:06:18.240> not<00:06:18.389> amazing<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.310> down<00:06:20.310> through

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
but it's not amazing and down through

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.920 
but it's not amazing and down through
where<00:06:20.789> you<00:06:20.819> would<00:06:21.090> put<00:06:21.210> your<00:06:21.360> feet<00:06:21.539> that<00:06:21.719> works

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
where you would put your feet that works

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.740 
where you would put your feet that works
out<00:06:22.110> pretty<00:06:22.319> well<00:06:22.440> here's<00:06:23.219> the<00:06:23.460> base<00:06:23.750> it's

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
out pretty well here's the base it's

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.209 
out pretty well here's the base it's
pretty<00:06:25.020> basic<00:06:25.139> on<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.500> bottom<00:06:25.800> and<00:06:25.949> then<00:06:26.039> of

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219 
pretty basic on the bottom and then of

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.529 
pretty basic on the bottom and then of
course<00:06:26.279> you<00:06:26.520> have<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.669> Technic<00:06:26.969> pieces<00:06:27.270> again

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
course you have the Technic pieces again

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.200 
course you have the Technic pieces again
going<00:06:27.810> through<00:06:28.080> for<00:06:28.379> the<00:06:28.699> for<00:06:29.699> the<00:06:29.819> axles<00:06:30.150> to

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
going through for the for the axles to

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.869 
going through for the for the axles to
go<00:06:30.389> through<00:06:31.009> so<00:06:32.009> again<00:06:32.219> I<00:06:32.250> really<00:06:32.729> thought

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
go through so again I really thought

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.839 
go through so again I really thought
this<00:06:33.029> atv<00:06:33.479> had<00:06:33.659> a<00:06:33.690> lot<00:06:33.930> of<00:06:34.080> potential<00:06:34.409> I<00:06:34.849> was

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
this atv had a lot of potential I was

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.790 
this atv had a lot of potential I was
hoping<00:06:36.149> for<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.389> lot<00:06:36.599> it<00:06:36.839> is<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:37.139> third<00:06:37.440> build

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
hoping for a lot it is the third build

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.020 
hoping for a lot it is the third build
of<00:06:38.099> a<00:06:38.219> three<00:06:38.460> build<00:06:38.639> set<00:06:38.969> so<00:06:39.330> you

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
of a three build set so you

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.250 
of a three build set so you
ask<00:06:40.240> too<00:06:40.510> much<00:06:40.690> when<00:06:40.900> they're<00:06:40.990> trying<00:06:41.170> to

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
ask too much when they're trying to

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.050 
ask too much when they're trying to
recycle<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.800> same<00:06:41.830> pieces<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:42.580> it's<00:06:42.700> okay

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
recycle the same pieces and it's okay

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.090 
recycle the same pieces and it's okay
for<00:06:43.090> what<00:06:43.510> it<00:06:43.630> is<00:06:43.780> but<00:06:44.380> definitely<00:06:44.830> not<00:06:44.920> my

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
for what it is but definitely not my

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.950 
for what it is but definitely not my
favorite<00:06:45.340> I<00:06:45.790> think<00:06:46.120> that<00:06:46.240> go-kart<00:06:46.390> definitely

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
favorite I think that go-kart definitely

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960 
favorite I think that go-kart definitely
takes<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.200> cake<00:06:47.290> in<00:06:47.680> this<00:06:47.800> set<00:06:48.070> as<00:06:48.220> the<00:06:48.460> as<00:06:48.760> the

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
takes the cake in this set as the as the

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.330 
takes the cake in this set as the as the
coolest<00:06:49.360> of<00:06:49.570> the<00:06:49.720> three<00:06:50.020> and<00:06:50.260> I<00:06:50.650> thought<00:06:51.040> for

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
coolest of the three and I thought for

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.770 
coolest of the three and I thought for
one<00:06:51.490> last<00:06:51.670> little<00:06:51.880> shot<00:06:52.180> here<00:06:52.210> I'd<00:06:52.480> show<00:06:52.750> you

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
one last little shot here I'd show you

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.920 
one last little shot here I'd show you
my<00:06:53.140> ATV<00:06:54.070> that<00:06:54.340> I<00:06:54.370> made<00:06:54.670> using<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.510> five<00:06:55.690> dollar

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
my ATV that I made using the five dollar

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.350 
my ATV that I made using the five dollar
creator<00:06:56.800> set<00:06:57.160> this<00:06:57.340> was<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.790> tower<00:06:58.090> digger

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
creator set this was the tower digger

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.770 
creator set this was the tower digger
versus<00:06:59.200> the<00:06:59.590> ATV<00:07:00.370> that<00:07:00.520> they<00:07:00.670> had<00:07:00.820> and<00:07:01.300> I<00:07:01.570> think

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
versus the ATV that they had and I think

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.960 
versus the ATV that they had and I think
I<00:07:01.870> did<00:07:01.990> pretty<00:07:02.020> good<00:07:02.290> for<00:07:02.710> for<00:07:03.340> comparison's

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
I did pretty good for for comparison's

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.490 
I did pretty good for for comparison's
sake<00:07:04.120> I<00:07:04.330> mean<00:07:04.450> my<00:07:04.570> handlebars<00:07:05.080> definitely

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
sake I mean my handlebars definitely

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.780 
sake I mean my handlebars definitely
look<00:07:05.590> worse<00:07:05.800> than<00:07:05.830> what's<00:07:06.250> there<00:07:06.460> but<00:07:06.610> I<00:07:06.670> had

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
look worse than what's there but I had

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.340 
look worse than what's there but I had

to use what I had you can see I have the
same<00:07:08.530> kind<00:07:08.740> of<00:07:08.800> front<00:07:09.040> bumper<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.970> back
