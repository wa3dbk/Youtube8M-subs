00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.930
 dog collars with spikes with 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.029
 fed in ancient Greece and 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.680
 they were originally designed to 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.650
 protect the throats of dogs 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.660
 during the attacks of the wolves hello 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.640
 guys how are you here today with my 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.950
 doggie chips and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.080
 do as a snack for your 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.029
 puppies will love them very much and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.820
 they are also emptied like making them 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.970
 bed for your puppy does not have is very 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.430
 easy to do and take care of very little 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.649
 materials and this I think a lot of 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.260
 you can do these things so 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.260
 if you are interested in how to make them 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.230
 let's start with the snacks to your 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 puppy you will love it very much 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 just remember to give a few 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.040
 day do not go to give everything remember are 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.939
 snacks we do not want our 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.939
 puppies in order 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.170
 The first thing you will need is a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.250
 baby food container I use 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.250
 two cans of gerber 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.130
 I put three or four tablespoons of 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.560
 flour stirs very well and instead of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.530
 pour more flour better oat milk 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.050
 you can skip this step and add 1 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.520
 or 2 tablespoons more flour 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.120
 but I wanted it to be a little bit more 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120
 healthy 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.860
 and now you're going to put the botanicals in a 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.750
 paper cookie and you're going to bake 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.140
 for about 10 minutes or until 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.830
 are ready at a temperature of 350 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.370
 degrees 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.370
 no no 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.229
 and you can give your puppy you're 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.959
 botanitas as you start to educate him or 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.140
 train him or just when he behaves 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.140
 all right 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.079
 and now I'll teach you how to make 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.150
 this little bed that is very easy to make 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.670
 you need a long-sleeved shirt 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.609
 you are going to flip the shirt and you are going to sew 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.609

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.470
 when you finish you turn your shirt 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.250

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.260
