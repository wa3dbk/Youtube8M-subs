morning period we say six Easter it is
absolutely<00:00:05.400> fascinating<00:00:05.609> because<00:00:06.089> when<00:00:06.299> you

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
absolutely fascinating because when you

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.120 
absolutely fascinating because when you
think<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.629> genes<00:00:06.960> typically<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.799> think<00:00:07.830> of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
think of genes typically you think of

that<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.199> did<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:22.890> actually

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that they did this was they actually

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.179 
that they did this was they actually
followed<00:00:23.490> 20,000<00:00:24.330> young<00:00:24.510> men<00:00:24.779> between<00:00:25.410> grades

7 through 12 for some time they did

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
7 through 12 for some time they did

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
blood they tried to figure out was there

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.950 
blood they tried to figure out was there
something<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> would<00:00:33.270> emerge<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.899> a

something that would emerge as a

something that would emerge as a

predictor of violent behavior in fact
there<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.719> there<00:00:37.559> were<00:00:37.620> three<00:00:37.890> genes<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
there was there were three genes as you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.520 
there was there were three genes as you
mentioned<00:00:38.879> call<00:00:39.090> them<00:00:39.270> violence<00:00:39.780> genes<00:00:40.200> call

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
mentioned call them violence genes call

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.560 
mentioned call them violence genes call
them<00:00:40.710> bad<00:00:40.920> behavior<00:00:41.520> genes<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.480> they

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
them bad behavior genes but what they

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.180 
them bad behavior genes but what they
found<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.140> people<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:43.800> genes

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
found was if people had these genes

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160 
found was if people had these genes
they're<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.210> likely<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> violent

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
they're much more likely to be violent

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
they're much more likely to be violent

have all these various bad behaviors now
just<00:01:12.330> identifying<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> genes<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> might

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just identifying the genes as you might

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.410 
just identifying the genes as you might
imagine<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.490> part<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> issue<00:01:15.240> here

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
imagine is just part of the issue here

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630 
imagine is just part of the issue here
the<00:01:16.140> real<00:01:16.380> goal<00:01:16.740> according<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> doctors

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the real goal according to the doctors

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.310 
the real goal according to the doctors
that<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.850> spoke<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that we spoke with about this is to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
that we spoke with about this is to
eventually<00:01:19.770> develop<00:01:19.920> treatments<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
eventually develop treatments to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
eventually develop treatments to
counteract<00:01:21.689> those<00:01:21.900> genes<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.100> rid<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
counteract those genes and get rid of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
counteract those genes and get rid of
violence<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.540> interesting<00:01:25.020> stuff<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
violence really interesting stuff and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.899 
violence really interesting stuff and
they<00:01:25.799> also<00:01:25.979> found<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.729> just

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
they also found that there are just

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
they also found that there are just
things<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.290> things<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
things that they can do and things that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
things that they can do and things that
their<00:01:28.770> families<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.310> people<00:01:29.430> around<00:01:29.640> them<00:01:29.939> can

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
their families or people around them can

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
their families or people around them can
do<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.299> everyday<00:01:30.509> life<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.350> maybe<00:01:31.560> prevent

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
do in everyday life to maybe prevent

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.710 
do in everyday life to maybe prevent
them<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.460> acting<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.030> well<00:01:33.210> talk<00:01:33.509> about

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
them from acting out as well talk about

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
them from acting out as well talk about
that<00:01:34.100> yeah<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> talk<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:35.970> genes

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that yeah so when you talk about genes

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
that yeah so when you talk about genes
you<00:01:36.360> talk<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> gene<00:01:37.170> itself<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you talk about the gene itself which is

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
you talk about the gene itself which is
sort<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.340> your<00:01:38.520> potential<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.600> develop

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

which is the fact that you actually do
develop<00:01:44.100> something<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:45.299> found<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
develop something they found with one of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.800 
develop something they found with one of
the<00:01:46.140> genes<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.500> particular<00:01:46.820> if<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.360> young<00:01:48.570> man

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the genes in particular if a young man

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.380 
the genes in particular if a young man
was<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.560> regular<00:01:50.220> family<00:01:50.700> meals<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.240> have

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
was to have regular family meals to have

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.450 
was to have regular family meals to have
family<00:01:51.780> meals<00:01:51.960> every<00:01:52.320> single<00:01:52.619> day<00:01:52.799> they

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
family meals every single day they

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
family meals every single day they
almost<00:01:53.700> took<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> risk<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.659> expressing<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
almost took the risk of expressing that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
almost took the risk of expressing that
gene<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.040> zero<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.840> example

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
gene to zero so there was a an example

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.920 
gene to zero so there was a an example
of<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> environmental<00:01:59.520> counteraction<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
of a environmental counteraction so it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
of a environmental counteraction so it
is<00:02:01.049> possible<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.649> dilute<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.369> genes<00:02:02.700> just

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is possible to dilute these genes just

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.590 
is possible to dilute these genes just
through<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.689> simple<00:02:04.049> behaviors
