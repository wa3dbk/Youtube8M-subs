oh<00:00:24.350> look<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.590> got<00:00:25.619> an<00:00:25.920> idea<00:00:26.279> okay<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:27.000> had<00:00:27.269> an<00:00:27.390> idea

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
oh look I got an idea okay I had an idea

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.950 
oh look I got an idea okay I had an idea
in<00:00:27.840> my<00:00:27.930> head<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:29.550> wanted<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> see<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.210> happen

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
in my head and I wanted to see it happen

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
in my head and I wanted to see it happen
essentially<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.340> second<00:00:32.850> take<00:00:33.030> on

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
essentially it's like a second take on

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.049 
essentially it's like a second take on
the<00:00:33.329> Knicks<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:34.469> while<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> enjoyed<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the Knicks because while I enjoyed the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
the Knicks because while I enjoyed the
videos<00:00:36.420> themselves<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.559> previous<00:00:38.010> Knick

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
videos themselves of the previous Knick

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.860 
videos themselves of the previous Knick
series<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.790> feel<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> way<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> actually

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
series I feel like the way I actually

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.100 
series I feel like the way I actually
built<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> team<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:40.920> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.930> kind<00:00:42.930> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
built the team was just kind of kind of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.920 
built the team was just kind of kind of
stupid<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.190> honest<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.809> was

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
stupid to be honest I don't know it was

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510 
stupid to be honest I don't know it was
just<00:00:46.079> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> robotic<00:00:46.739> there<00:00:47.160> wasn't<00:00:47.430> much

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
just kind of robotic there wasn't much

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
just kind of robotic there wasn't much
thought<00:00:47.730> put<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.620> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
thought put into it I like it you know I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
thought put into it I like it you know I
like<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> videos<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.809> didn't

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
like it I like the videos but I didn't
like<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> built<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> team<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
like the way I built the team so this is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
like the way I built the team so this is
my<00:00:53.789> second<00:00:54.180> attempt<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.719> Knicks<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.260> you
