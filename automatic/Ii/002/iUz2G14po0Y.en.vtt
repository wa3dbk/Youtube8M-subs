00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.470
 and how hard today's stage is presented 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.230
 but good at least already in the last 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:26.199
 turn the last hard with desire of ship 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.199
 to see how it ends and to enjoy tomorrow 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 what are we going to do 40 minutes 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.630
 motivates them in the morning at the rally 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.660
 in some special way I try that 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.940
 I am a person that what I try is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.100
 rescue the positive because enough 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.630
 hardships we spent during the day and there 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.850
 There is the lid 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.550
 it really is a fundamental part of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.130
 this sport I believe that they knowing 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.659
 rescue those positive messages and from 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.939
 trust and to believe in themselves 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.569
 and that is one more point that gives them that 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.569
 it's the race 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 How to motivate yourself in covadonga lakes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.320
 antonio stone that works is also 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.409
 with one thing that I think I am now 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.289
 carpe diem enjoy and enjoy the 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.630
 moment enjoyed because it is so difficult 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.490
 that is repeated and more in teams like 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.549
 we are not all aware that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.579
 all humble team but worker and 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.429
 with constancy and by the beliefs of in 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.479
 the sense that we are all here 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.600
 nobody wins us until we pass the 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.220
 goal line that mentality to that 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 transmit to the professional kids 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.759
 you have here to compete and to win 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.149
 I do not conceive that a runner or in the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.429
 runner does not leave the race thinking about 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.000
 to see what I do today no no 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.720
 mentality is something to win and win 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.909
 obviously does not mean equal 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.099
 would win the top equal win and you would be 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.390
 win making among the first three of 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.700
 another team to do first by 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.170
 teams every time it would be the same is to help 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.720
 a partner to enter the part 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.230
