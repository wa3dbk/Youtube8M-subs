particularly unusual size but that's

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.080 
particularly unusual size but that's
fine<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:14.950> might<00:04:15.099> say<00:04:15.250> oh<00:04:15.430> I'd<00:04:15.670> like<00:04:15.819> it<00:04:16.000> to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
fine and I might say oh I'd like it to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.870 
fine and I might say oh I'd like it to
be<00:04:16.120> bold<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.039> click<00:04:21.100> within<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.639> box
