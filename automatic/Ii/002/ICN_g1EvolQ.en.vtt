00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
European elections which I thought was

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.110 
European elections which I thought was
totally<00:04:24.780> against<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.410> other<00:04:25.590> charter

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
totally against the other charter

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.610 
totally against the other charter
because<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.540> respect<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.200> fight<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.470> a

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
because I respect that the fight is a

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.040 
because I respect that the fight is a
domestic<00:04:29.160> issue<00:04:29.280> had<00:04:30.210> an<00:04:30.330> impact<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.930> a

domestic issue had an impact on a
European<00:04:31.470> election<00:04:31.950> campaign<00:04:32.430> must<00:04:32.940> have

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
European election campaign must have

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.690 
European election campaign must have
done<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:34.139> only<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.710> simpleton<00:04:35.190> would<00:04:35.490> see

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
other ways to be honest when I first I

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.950 
other ways to be honest when I first I

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
figures and doing my research on it out

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.330 
figures and doing my research on it out
of<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.760> media<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:49.350> just<00:04:49.770> thought<00:04:49.980> well<00:04:50.160> why

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
of the media and just thought well why

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.100 
of the media and just thought well why
wouldn't<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.180> know<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.870> I've<00:04:51.960> looked

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
wouldn't you you know and I've looked

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.629 
wouldn't you you know and I've looked
into<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.620> lot<00:04:52.740> because<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:53.100> don't<00:04:53.190> want<00:04:53.520> to

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
into it a lot because I don't want to

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.550 
into it a lot because I don't want to
make<00:04:53.850> in<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.210> vote<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.450> affects<00:04:54.960> my<00:04:55.230> family

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
make in a vote that affects my family

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.159 
make in a vote that affects my family
and<00:04:55.680> friends<00:04:55.830> down<00:04:56.190> south<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.780> doesn't<00:04:58.080> at

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
and friends down south and it doesn't at

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.290 
and friends down south and it doesn't at
all<00:04:58.320> it's<00:04:58.560> better<00:04:58.770> for<00:04:58.950> them<00:04:59.100> as<00:04:59.280> well<00:04:59.460> if<00:04:59.850> the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
all it's better for them as well if the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.500 
all it's better for them as well if the
media<00:05:00.690> was<00:05:00.900> fair<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:02.220> honest<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.480> think

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
media was fair and honest and I think

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.970 
media was fair and honest and I think
independence<00:05:04.290> would<00:05:04.440> be<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> walkover

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
independence would be a walkover

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.710 
independence would be a walkover
absolutely<00:05:08.180> my<00:05:09.180> children<00:05:09.600> obviously

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720

Scottish and they're born here and I

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.230 
Scottish and they're born here and I
