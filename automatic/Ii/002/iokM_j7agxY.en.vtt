00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.430
 this option is the screencast and we 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.470
 It serves to project our 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.990
 Android device to any other 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.930

 our smart view TV or any 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.759
 another place 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 this option is blocked by the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.960
 developers and can be unlocked 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.379
 but for this we need to be super 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.530
 users that is to have root done our 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:44.340

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.100
 [Music] 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.770
 and will help them 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.289
 want this option casting 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.460
 and it was blocked in the devices 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.649
 motogp so I'm going to show you that 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.649
 This is indeed a motorbike device 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.220
 and now yes 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.820
 this is a simple method 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.930
 quickly downloaded the application that 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.600
 they get in here 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.530
 they give you up here on sd card 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.530
 device 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.530
 then look in this folder that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.860
 flame system 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 they select it and they go to this file 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.700
 that says bild dot prop they select it 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.700
 and they open it as s not editor 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.240
 now they go up here and they give him edit 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.010
 and they look for 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.990
 you look up here is work 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.440
 a section that says 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.660
 property to choose between virtual 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.080
 external w 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.900
 and all that is not you are not going to us 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.720
 appear this that I have here marked 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.670
 that's going to show you what's coming 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.670
 up or is it going to look like this 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.620
 you just have to give space and 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.730
 copy what I have here is persists 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.280
 voice point 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.220
 point wwf point enable equal 1 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.120
 and after this grants salt in the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.909
 application only give you save 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.680
 after that you will have to 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.260
 restart your device so that it takes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.960
 effects the changes that you have already made 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.260
 I'm going to do it because I've already done it 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.190
 but having done it is only 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.380
 get into the configuration 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.670
 screen 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.720
 screen cast 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.709
 and the devices must already appear 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.930
 good and if their 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.000
 devices that are connected to the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.760
 same wifi network 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.850
 they go up and enable the box 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.200
 which says enable wireless screen 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.750
 in this way they will appear here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.180
 the entire list of devices that have 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.730
 you connected to your same wifi network 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.540
 so they can connect through 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.560
 wifi direct and you can see your screen 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.959
 android 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.060
 on your devices well then now 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.920
 I can only show you that this method 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.150
 if it works well already being here what 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.090
 only thing we need to do is 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.489
 select our device give 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.489
 up and wait for it to connect 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.520
 you first have to put your TV 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.440
 in the option this screen mirror or 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.930
 scream and rohring I do not know how it appears 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.500
 you poster is different 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.630
 I in my case have a sony bravia 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.500
 and we can see here that the image 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.750
 it's very fluid it does not cut and I do not know if the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.180
 camera reflects it but it has very good 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.910
 definition have the same option of 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.260
 auto rotate the screen you are watching 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.280
 exactly what I'm seeing in a 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.610
 phone 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.630
 and good now I'm going to connect a one command 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.830
 of xbox for 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.830
 play with a game 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.520
 yes 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.400
 the beginning so they can see what the 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.520
 delay more than half a second and also 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.330
 so they can see what the faithfulness of the 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.550
 water is very good 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.259

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.729
