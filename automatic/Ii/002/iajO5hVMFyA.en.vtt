00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
we have our single acting double acting

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.800 
we have our single acting double acting

installed front hitch one thing we want
to<00:00:43.850> be<00:00:44.000> sure<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.630> that<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:45.020> red<00:00:45.350> light<00:00:45.620> is

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
to be sure of is that this red light is

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.030 
to be sure of is that this red light is
on<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:47.149> your<00:00:47.300> front<00:00:47.510> hitch<00:00:47.810> is<00:00:48.170> in<00:00:48.440> single

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
on so that your front hitch is in single

on so that your front hitch is in single
acting<00:00:49.430> mode<00:00:50.590> secondly<00:00:51.590> we<00:00:51.980> want<00:00:52.220> look<00:00:52.700> what

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
acting mode secondly we want look what

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.310 
acting mode secondly we want look what
would<00:00:53.120> happen<00:00:53.420> if<00:00:53.510> it<00:00:53.600> was<00:00:53.630> in<00:00:53.780> double<00:00:53.960> acting

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
would happen if it was in double acting

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.520 
would happen if it was in double acting
you<00:00:54.710> would<00:00:54.860> have<00:00:55.010> down<00:00:55.280> pressure<00:00:55.610> on<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
you would have down pressure on on the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.280 
you would have down pressure on on the
actual<00:00:57.920> hitch<00:00:58.190> itself<00:00:58.690> from<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.840> cylinders

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
actual hitch itself from the cylinders

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.350 
actual hitch itself from the cylinders
which<00:01:00.829> would<00:01:01.010> put<00:01:01.219> pressure<00:01:01.399> not<00:01:01.760> only<00:01:02.059> on<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
which would put pressure not only on the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.200 
which would put pressure not only on the
front<00:01:02.480> more<00:01:02.809> on<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.890> skid<00:01:04.100> shoes<00:01:04.369> but<00:01:04.670> as<00:01:04.939> well

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
front more on the skid shoes but as well

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.840 
front more on the skid shoes but as well
as<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.990> chains<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.500> hold<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.860> up<00:01:07.040> okay

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
as the the chains that hold it up okay

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.490 
as the the chains that hold it up okay
so<00:01:07.909> could<00:01:08.270> damage<00:01:08.509> it<00:01:08.750> then<00:01:08.899> it's<00:01:09.079> not<00:01:09.170> in

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
so could damage it then it's not in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.209 
so could damage it then it's not in
single<00:01:09.920> act<00:01:10.100> correct<00:01:10.549> alright<00:01:11.110> also<00:01:12.110> for<00:01:13.009> our

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
single act correct alright also for our

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.580 
single act correct alright also for our

the<00:01:16.340> rear<00:01:16.729> butterfly<00:01:17.209> mowers<00:01:17.600> we<00:01:17.749> want<00:01:17.959> to<00:01:18.020> be

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
the rear butterfly mowers we want to be

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:20.770 
the rear butterfly mowers we want to be
sure<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.649> our<00:01:18.679> rear<00:01:19.389> three-point<00:01:20.389> height

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
sure that our rear three-point height

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.160 
sure that our rear three-point height
control<00:01:21.409> setting<00:01:21.889> is<00:01:22.009> is<00:01:22.939> set<00:01:23.569> low<00:01:23.869> enough

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
control setting is is set low enough

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.010 
control setting is is set low enough
that<00:01:24.469> when<00:01:25.069> you<00:01:25.189> lift<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.810> rear

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
that when you lift the the rear

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.429 
that when you lift the the rear
implement<00:01:27.639> or<00:01:28.639> the<00:01:28.850> rear<00:01:29.029> mowers<00:01:29.420> there<00:01:29.659> to

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
implement or the rear mowers there to

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.959 
implement or the rear mowers there to
put<00:01:30.590> them<00:01:30.709> into<00:01:30.829> transport<00:01:31.399> mode<00:01:31.700> or

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
put them into transport mode or

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.789 
put them into transport mode or
something<00:01:32.270> like<00:01:32.389> that<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.659> that<00:01:33.469> we're<00:01:33.649> not

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
something like that that that we're not

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.239 
something like that that that we're not
pinching<00:01:34.310> any<00:01:34.459> of<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.659> PTO<00:01:36.109> shafts<00:01:36.499> or<00:01:36.889> or

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
pinching any of the the PTO shafts or or

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.639 
pinching any of the the PTO shafts or or
angles<00:01:37.700> they<00:01:37.819> are<00:01:38.179> not<00:01:38.689> too<00:01:38.929> great<00:01:39.200> there<00:01:39.469> so

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
angles they are not too great there so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.399 
angles they are not too great there so
we<00:01:39.770> have<00:01:40.189> that<00:01:40.369> set<00:01:40.639> low<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:41.899> if<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.109> was<00:01:42.229> turned

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
we have that set low so if it was turned

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.019 
we have that set low so if it was turned
all<00:01:42.529> the<00:01:42.619> way<00:01:42.740> up<00:01:42.829> we've<00:01:43.039> actually<00:01:43.279> lifting

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
all the way up we've actually lifting

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:45.940 
all the way up we've actually lifting
the<00:01:44.119> implement<00:01:44.539> too<00:01:44.840> high<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:45.439> had<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.770> risk

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the implement too high and we had a risk

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.800 
the implement too high and we had a risk
of<00:01:46.069> damaging<00:01:46.429> as<00:01:46.579> well<00:01:46.789> so<00:01:46.999> make<00:01:47.209> sure<00:01:47.240> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
of damaging as well so make sure that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.440 
of damaging as well so make sure that
setting<00:01:48.709> is<00:01:48.950> correct<00:01:49.369> right<00:01:49.729> that's<00:01:50.149> correct

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
setting is correct right that's correct

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.029 
setting is correct right that's correct
yeah<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> want<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.319> make<00:01:51.409> sure<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.859> is

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
yeah I want to make sure that this is

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.669 
yeah I want to make sure that this is
low<00:01:52.249> so<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.639> whenever<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:53.060> do<00:01:53.209> lift<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.679> you

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
low so that whenever you do lift it you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.019 
low so that whenever you do lift it you
know<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.159> when<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.609> mowers<00:01:55.880> are

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:56.029 
know that that when the mowers are

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.959 
know that that when the mowers are
folded<00:01:56.419> together<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:58.069> your<00:01:58.459> transport

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
folded together that a your transport

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.359 
folded together that a your transport
height<00:01:59.179> is<00:01:59.329> not<00:01:59.479> too<00:01:59.749> great<00:02:00.069> for<00:02:01.069> power<00:02:01.249> lines

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
height is not too great for power lines

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.879 
height is not too great for power lines
and<00:02:01.849> things<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:02.659> also<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.499> know

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889 
and things like that but also you know

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.469 
and things like that but also you know
if<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.130> pick<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.429> up<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.700> how<00:02:04.849> you<00:02:04.880> would<00:02:05.179> you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
if you pick it up to how you would you

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.830 
if you pick it up to how you would you
would<00:02:05.630> risk<00:02:05.810> damaging<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.709> PTO<00:02:07.840> driveshaft

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
would risk damaging the PTO driveshaft

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.230 
would risk damaging the PTO driveshaft
okay

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
okay

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.150 
okay
what<00:02:12.240> we<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.410> number<00:02:13.530> six<00:02:13.920> valve

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
what we have is is the number six valve

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.210 
what we have is is the number six valve
will<00:02:14.460> activate<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.030> front<00:02:15.510> hitch<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
will activate your front hitch and to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.940 
will activate your front hitch and to
put<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.640> put<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.569> front<00:02:18.870> hitch<00:02:19.110> into<00:02:19.410> float

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
put that put that front hitch into float

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.640 
put that put that front hitch into float
mode<00:02:20.390> basically<00:02:21.390> what<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.930> would<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.319> do

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
mode basically what we would have to do

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.809 
mode basically what we would have to do
is<00:02:22.890> press<00:02:23.250> down<00:02:23.600> on<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.530> button<00:02:25.740> rock<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
switch forward and that that will that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.000 
switch forward and that that will that
will<00:02:29.850> activate<00:02:30.300> float<00:02:30.780> mode<00:02:31.020> once<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.980> is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
will activate float mode once it is

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.260 
will activate float mode once it is
turned<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.680> console<00:02:35.190> there<00:02:35.430> that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
machine in to float all you have to do

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.640 
machine in to float all you have to do
is<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.370> rock<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.600> joystick<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> way

forward and you'll see the mower go all

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.830 
forward and you'll see the mower go all
the<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:01.530> into<00:03:01.739> float<00:03:02.010> position<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.850> then<00:03:03.690> if

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
the way into float position and then if

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.680 
the way into float position and then if
you<00:03:03.959> look<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.320> your<00:03:04.350> screen<00:03:04.680> here<00:03:05.330> if<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.540> can

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
you look on your screen here if you can

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.729 
you look on your screen here if you can
see<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.110> we've<00:03:07.800> got<00:03:08.010> float<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
see that we've got float to the to the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.030 
see that we've got float to the to the
hitch<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> valve<00:03:12.930> there<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.500> that

hitch or to the valve there and that
squiggle<00:03:14.610> mark<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:15.060> means<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.019> in

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
squiggle mark there means that it is in

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.380 
squiggle mark there means that it is in
float<00:03:16.530> mode<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.130> that's<00:03:17.700> what<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.090> want<00:03:18.299> to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
float mode and that's what we want to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.550 
float mode and that's what we want to
see<00:03:19.730> now<00:03:20.730> for<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.120> rear<00:03:21.329> mowers<00:03:21.720> we<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.260> them

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
see now for the rear mowers we have them

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.580 
see now for the rear mowers we have them
set<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:23.100> valve<00:03:23.370> number<00:03:23.700> three<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.380> we<00:03:25.380> also

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
set up on valve number three and we also

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.640 
set up on valve number three and we also
want<00:03:25.980> them<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.220> be<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.790> float<00:03:27.150> mode<00:03:27.420> as<00:03:27.690> well<00:03:28.049> so

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
want them to be in float mode as well so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.620 
want them to be in float mode as well so
just<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.250> hitch<00:03:29.489> we're<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.420> press

way<00:03:33.239> forward<00:03:34.070> those<00:03:35.070> those<00:03:35.790> will<00:03:36.030> go<00:03:36.180> into

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
way forward those those will go into

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.360 
way forward those those will go into
float<00:03:36.660> as<00:03:36.900> well

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
float as well

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.880 
float as well
just<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> front<00:03:39.720> more<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.409> will<00:03:40.530> see<00:03:40.709> on

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
just like the front more you will see on

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.820 
just like the front more you will see on
the<00:03:41.010> screen<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.659> in<00:03:42.900> float<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
the screen that it is in float this is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.210 
the screen that it is in float this is
the<00:03:46.920> fella<00:03:47.190> control<00:03:47.730> box<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.379> triple

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the fella control box for the triple

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.899 
the fella control box for the triple
mowers<00:03:51.590> what<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:52.709> have<00:03:52.860> here<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.370> control

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
mowers what we have here this control

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.149 
mowers what we have here this control
box<00:03:54.090> basically<00:03:54.420> activates<00:03:55.349> the

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
box basically activates the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
implement the way that it's set up here

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.229 
implement the way that it's set up here
right<00:04:01.319> now<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.860> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.519> like<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.060> would

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
right now is going to be like it would

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.699 
right now is going to be like it would
be<00:04:03.269> for<00:04:03.750> transport<00:04:04.440> mode<00:04:05.900> once<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.110> unfold

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
be for transport mode once you unfold

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.339 
be for transport mode once you unfold

controlling each side independently or
together<00:04:44.490> if<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:45.539> wanted<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.930> just<00:04:46.200> control

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
together if you wanted to just control

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.469 
together if you wanted to just control
the<00:04:47.430> right<00:04:47.639> hand<00:04:48.030> mower

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
the right hand mower

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.379 
the right hand mower
you<00:04:48.990> would<00:04:49.139> turn<00:04:49.320> off<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.770> left<00:04:49.979> side<00:04:50.099> and

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
you would turn off the left side and

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.149 
you would turn off the left side and
if<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:53.050> wanted<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.379> could<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.800> control<00:04:54.039> the

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
if you wanted to could just control the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.589 
if you wanted to could just control the
left<00:04:54.400> side<00:04:54.610> obviously<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.090> would<00:04:55.240> turn<00:04:55.449> off

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
left side obviously you would turn off

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.760 
left side obviously you would turn off
the<00:04:55.930> right<00:04:56.139> side

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
the right side

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.439 
the right side
controlling<00:04:57.250> them<00:04:57.460> together<00:04:57.669> both<00:04:58.180> switches

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
controlling them together both switches

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.619 
controlling them together both switches
need<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.930> be<00:04:59.050> down<00:04:59.289> at<00:05:00.219> that<00:05:00.460> point<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:01.389> can

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
need to be down at that point you can

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.520 
need to be down at that point you can
turn<00:05:02.469> your<00:05:02.710> tractor<00:05:03.069> hydraulics<00:05:03.699> on<00:05:04.530> that

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
turn your tractor hydraulics on that

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.230 
turn your tractor hydraulics on that
will<00:05:05.710> put<00:05:05.919> those<00:05:06.069> mowers<00:05:06.430> into<00:05:06.639> float<00:05:06.909> and

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
will put those mowers into float and

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.640 
will put those mowers into float and
drop<00:05:08.020> them<00:05:08.289> down<00:05:08.889> for<00:05:09.310> work<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:11.169> then<00:05:11.409> once

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
drop them down for work and then once

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.040 
drop them down for work and then once
you<00:05:11.740> get<00:05:11.860> ready<00:05:12.099> to<00:05:12.280> lift<00:05:12.490> them<00:05:12.759> just<00:05:13.539> send<00:05:13.750> oil

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
you get ready to lift them just send oil

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.369 
you get ready to lift them just send oil
again<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.180> mowers<00:05:16.509> and<00:05:16.780> they<00:05:17.050> will<00:05:17.229> go

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
again to the mowers and they will go

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:25.270 
again to the mowers and they will go
into<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.770> head

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:38.400 

you<00:05:26.280> can't<00:05:26.820> go<00:05:26.940> ahead<00:05:27.060> on<00:05:27.180> coke

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.579 

now<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.040> can<00:05:39.190> headline<00:05:39.550> position<00:05:40.150> right

which is down to activate
put<00:05:46.889> your<00:05:47.039> double-acting<00:05:47.550> valve<00:05:47.789> into<00:05:48.119> place

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.220
