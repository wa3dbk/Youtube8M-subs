a half tons on its own and from start to
finish<00:01:10.600> it's<00:01:11.440> 58<00:01:12.430> days

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.510 

the<00:01:24.510> structure<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> very<00:01:25.870> complicated

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the structure is a very complicated

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.610 
the structure is a very complicated
build<00:01:27.520> everything<00:01:28.360> has<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.840> be<00:01:28.960> meticulously

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
build everything has to be meticulously

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.710 
build everything has to be meticulously
set<00:01:29.950> out<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.340> make<00:01:30.490> sure<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.700> fits<00:01:30.940> on<00:01:31.090> site<00:01:31.330> and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
set out to make sure it fits on site and

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.790 
set out to make sure it fits on site and
I<00:01:31.810> say<00:01:31.960> we'll<00:01:32.140> work<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.380> tolerances<00:01:32.740> of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
I say we'll work the tolerances of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.500 
I say we'll work the tolerances of
fifteen<00:01:33.190> millimeters<00:01:33.700> nine<00:01:34.090> times<00:01:34.330> out<00:01:34.479> of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
fifteen millimeters nine times out of

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.870 
fifteen millimeters nine times out of
ten<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:35.050> fits<00:01:35.290> and<00:01:35.470> if<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.650> doesn't<00:01:35.770> fit<00:01:36.010> we'll

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
ten it fits and if it doesn't fit we'll

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:48.210 
ten it fits and if it doesn't fit we'll
make<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.060> fit<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:38.290> someone<00:01:38.590> job<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:48.009> we're

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
make it fit on someone job now we're

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.650 
make it fit on someone job now we're
stood<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.700> one<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.940> high<00:01:49.060> sections<00:01:49.509> and

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
stood up on one of the high sections and

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.700 
stood up on one of the high sections and
we're<00:01:49.780> in<00:01:49.900> between<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.259> two<00:01:50.380> layers<00:01:50.530> of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
we're in between the two layers of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.170 
we're in between the two layers of
structure<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.430> here<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.670> my<00:01:51.759> right<00:01:51.940> we<00:01:52.060> can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
structure and here to my right we can

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.030 
structure and here to my right we can
see<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.509> ETP<00:01:52.780> but<00:01:53.410> I<00:01:53.440> mean<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.740> can<00:01:53.860> liken

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
see the ETP but I mean you can liken

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.639 
see the ETP but I mean you can liken
this<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.000> sail<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.479> on<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.810> yacht<00:01:56.080> it

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
this to to a sail on a on a yacht it

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.010 
this to to a sail on a on a yacht it
really<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.729> stressed<00:01:58.210> material<00:01:58.810> so

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
really this is a stressed material so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.290 
really this is a stressed material so
when<00:01:59.800> you<00:01:59.950> when<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.310> when<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.670> work<00:02:00.940> with<00:02:00.970> it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
when you when you when you work with it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.290 
when you when you when you work with it
it's<00:02:01.690> actually<00:02:01.750> quite<00:02:02.020> flexible<00:02:02.289> so

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
it's actually quite flexible so

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.790 
it's actually quite flexible so
physically<00:02:04.300> pulling<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.960> structure<00:02:05.380> apart

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
physically pulling that structure apart

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.130 
physically pulling that structure apart
that's<00:02:06.009> what<00:02:06.160> stresses<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.660> material

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
that's what stresses that that material

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.360 
that's what stresses that that material
you<00:02:10.110> never<00:02:11.110> get<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.290> chance<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.590> pre<00:02:11.890> builders

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
you never get a chance to pre builders

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.540 
you never get a chance to pre builders
so<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.209> all<00:02:13.440> built<00:02:14.440> I've<00:02:14.590> drawn<00:02:14.860> brought<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
so it's all built I've drawn brought the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.500 
so it's all built I've drawn brought the
site<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> first<00:02:16.180> time<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.420> been

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
site and the first time it's been

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.699 
site and the first time it's been
together<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:17.050> wanna<00:02:17.440> come<00:02:17.650> say<00:02:17.830> oh<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:23.650> a

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
together just wanna come say oh it's a

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.460 
together just wanna come say oh it's a
real<00:02:24.030> pallet<00:02:25.030> mix<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.450> every<00:02:25.900> single<00:02:26.110> piece

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
real pallet mix and every single piece

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.470 
real pallet mix and every single piece
of<00:02:26.500> ETF<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.280> slightly<00:02:27.730> different<00:02:27.880> color<00:02:28.180> as

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
of ETF is a slightly different color as

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.770 
of ETF is a slightly different color as
color<00:02:29.110> drives<00:02:29.620> emotion<00:02:30.070> anyway<00:02:30.340> within<00:02:30.610> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
color drives emotion anyway within you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.850 
color drives emotion anyway within you
you<00:02:31.780> soothe<00:02:31.989> different<00:02:32.440> emotions<00:02:32.769> and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
you soothe different emotions and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.110 
you soothe different emotions and
different<00:02:33.160> parts<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.519> structure

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.470 

we<00:02:38.599> are<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.260> process<00:02:39.590> now<00:02:40.040> of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
we are now in this process now of

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.500 
we are now in this process now of
wrapping<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.610> desserts<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.849> layers<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
wrapping the the desserts and layers and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.250 
wrapping the the desserts and layers and
the<00:02:44.690> purpose<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.290> kind<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.430> always<00:02:46.870> not<00:02:47.870> how

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the purpose is to kind of always not how

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.770 
the purpose is to kind of always not how
its<00:02:48.500> material<00:02:49.040> by<00:02:49.160> itself<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:49.880> how<00:02:50.090> interacts

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
its material by itself but how interacts

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.100 
its material by itself but how interacts
so<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.410> about<00:02:51.590> getting<00:02:52.400> inside<00:02:52.730> outside<00:02:53.720> and

every year we build a pavilion by
international<00:03:27.480> architects<00:03:27.930> they<00:03:28.110> start<00:03:28.409> with

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
international architects they start with

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.949 
international architects they start with
little<00:03:28.890> models<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.549> from<00:03:30.030> these<00:03:30.180> very<00:03:30.480> modest

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
little models and from these very modest

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.080 
little models and from these very modest
beginnings<00:03:31.409> you<00:03:31.769> go<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.280> something<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:32.879> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
beginnings you go to something that you
