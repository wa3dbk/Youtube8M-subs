so<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> small<00:00:03.360> Creek<00:00:03.720> fairly<00:00:04.560> close<00:00:04.770> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
so this is a small Creek fairly close to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.550 
so this is a small Creek fairly close to
my<00:00:05.100> home<00:00:05.400> it's<00:00:05.790> modestly<00:00:06.509> high<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.049> gradient

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
my home it's modestly high in gradient

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.009 
my home it's modestly high in gradient
as<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> lot<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.040> pocket<00:00:08.400> water<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:09.360> has<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> fairly

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
as a lot of pocket water it has a fairly

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.520 
as a lot of pocket water it has a fairly
good<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.440> healthy<00:00:10.950> population<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.730> native

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
good and healthy population of native

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.189 
good and healthy population of native
cutthroat<00:00:13.530> trout<00:00:14.540> today<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> little<00:00:16.109> bit

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
cutthroat trout today was a little bit

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.920 
cutthroat trout today was a little bit
difficult<00:00:16.379> because<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.980> bright<00:00:17.160> Sun<00:00:17.570> but<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
difficult because the bright Sun but I

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.090 
difficult because the bright Sun but I
was<00:00:19.920> able<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.250> pick<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.640> number<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.970> fish

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
was able to pick up a number of fish

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.189 
was able to pick up a number of fish
like<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.359> one's<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.810> average

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
like this one this one's about average

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.370 
like this one this one's about average
size<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.859> Creek<00:00:26.990> you'll<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.140> able<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
size for this Creek you'll be able to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.640 
size for this Creek you'll be able to
see<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:29.160> upcoming<00:00:29.490> clips<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.500> hook<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
see in some upcoming clips that I hook a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
see in some upcoming clips that I hook a
few<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.940> off<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.540> it's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
few but then they get off and it's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.810 
few but then they get off and it's
mainly<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:35.340> paying<00:00:35.670> attention

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
mainly because I'm not paying attention

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.720 
mainly because I'm not paying attention
like<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.570> should<00:00:37.100> I<00:00:38.540> tend<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
like I should I tend to have that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:01:05.140 
like I should I tend to have that
problem<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:42.030> looking<00:00:42.360> around

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.540 

here's<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.300> those<00:01:06.480> fish<00:01:06.800> first<00:01:07.800> cast<00:01:08.190> through

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
here's one those fish first cast through

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.720 
here's one those fish first cast through
then<00:01:08.970> hook<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.050> then<00:01:10.200> he<00:01:10.290> gets<00:01:10.530> off<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.130> am

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
then hook and then he gets off I am

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.860 
then hook and then he gets off I am
using<00:01:12.030> barbless<00:01:12.540> hooks<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.050> that<00:01:13.200> may<00:01:14.870> that

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
using barbless hooks and that may that

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:28.080 
using barbless hooks and that may that
may<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.410> reason<00:01:17.070> why

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.580 

here's<00:01:29.090> another<00:01:29.240> one<00:01:29.810> first<00:01:30.079> cast<00:01:30.380> through

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
here's another one first cast through

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.200 
here's another one first cast through
this<00:01:30.740> pool<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.100> fish<00:01:31.399> right<00:01:31.520> in<00:01:31.670> front<00:01:31.969> of<00:01:32.060> that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
this pool of fish right in front of that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.240 
this pool of fish right in front of that
rock<00:01:33.049> right<00:01:33.079> in<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.439> middle<00:01:33.679> of<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.890> screen

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
rock right in the middle of the screen

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.499 
rock right in the middle of the screen
right<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.579> front<00:01:34.759> hydraulic<00:01:35.420> he<00:01:36.380> takes<00:01:36.679> it<00:01:37.509> and

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
right in front hydraulic he takes it and

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.929 
right in front hydraulic he takes it and
he<00:01:38.569> gets<00:01:39.140> off<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.710> don't<00:01:40.250> really<00:01:40.399> mind<00:01:40.729> that

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
he gets off I don't really mind that

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:55.320 
he gets off I don't really mind that
because<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.390> release<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.990> fish<00:01:42.170> anyway

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.180 

this<00:01:56.330> next<00:01:56.600> fish<00:01:56.870> was<00:01:57.140> right<00:01:57.320> tied<00:01:57.620> up<00:01:57.800> against

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
this next fish was right tied up against

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.950 
this next fish was right tied up against
the<00:01:58.280> rock<00:01:58.460> up<00:01:58.730> on<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.000> upper<00:01:59.330> left<00:01:59.600> but<00:01:59.870> the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
the rock up on the upper left but the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.980 
the rock up on the upper left but the
plunge<00:02:00.230> pool<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.760> he's<00:02:01.760> pretty<00:02:02.030> small<00:02:02.390> one<00:02:02.600> and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
plunge pool is he's pretty small one and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.740 
plunge pool is he's pretty small one and
that<00:02:03.500> really<00:02:03.770> didn't<00:02:04.150> put<00:02:05.150> up<00:02:05.300> much<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.540> a

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
that really didn't put up much of a

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.310 
that really didn't put up much of a
fight

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
fight

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:29.490 
fight
with<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.430> iguana<00:02:08.240> ix<00:02:09.200> Letran

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.720 

through<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.620> section<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.280> want<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.549> show

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
through this section I just want to show

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.890 
through this section I just want to show
you<00:02:31.790> what<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.180> Creek<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.480> like<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.620> about

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
you what this Creek is like it's about

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.020 
you what this Creek is like it's about
maybe<00:02:35.900> seven<00:02:36.260> feet<00:02:36.590> wide<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.400> there's<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.700> lot

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
maybe seven feet wide and there's a lot

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.039 
maybe seven feet wide and there's a lot
of<00:02:38.799> overhanging<00:02:39.799> limbs<00:02:40.750> there's<00:02:41.750> some<00:02:41.900> really

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
of overhanging limbs there's some really

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.910 
of overhanging limbs there's some really
not<00:02:42.290> nice<00:02:42.769> holes<00:02:43.069> down<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:44.120> these<00:02:45.109> areas<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.739> I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
not nice holes down in these areas but I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.380 
not nice holes down in these areas but I
could<00:02:46.280> not<00:02:46.430> figure<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.879> way<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.150> either

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
could not figure out a way to either

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.210 
could not figure out a way to either
cast<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.019> them<00:02:48.159> or<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.930> even<00:02:51.170> raise<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.500> rod<00:02:51.859> if

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
cast to them or to even raise the rod if

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.179 
cast to them or to even raise the rod if
I<00:02:52.430> would<00:02:52.579> have<00:02:52.670> hooked<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.909> fish<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:54.189> certainly

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
I would have hooked a fish I certainly

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.949 
I would have hooked a fish I certainly
could<00:02:55.430> have<00:02:55.519> done<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.670> bow<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.030> arrow<00:02:56.150> cast<00:02:56.569> but

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
could have done a bow and arrow cast but

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.630 
could have done a bow and arrow cast but
if<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.230> would<00:02:57.379> have<00:02:57.470> hooked<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.040> fish<00:02:58.250> than

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
if I would have hooked a fish than

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.699 
if I would have hooked a fish than
raising<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.659> rod<00:02:59.810> would<00:02:59.989> put<00:03:00.200> me<00:03:00.319> right<00:03:00.349> into

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
raising the rod would put me right into

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.670 
raising the rod would put me right into
the<00:03:00.829> branches<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:02.079> wanted<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.139> work<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.560> this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
the branches I wanted to work up to this

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
the branches I wanted to work up to this
next<00:03:04.040> pool<00:03:08.859> this<00:03:09.859> pool<00:03:09.920> was<00:03:10.220> very<00:03:10.459> difficult

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
next pool this pool was very difficult

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.729 
next pool this pool was very difficult
because<00:03:11.030> there<00:03:11.450> was<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.750> lot<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.200> low-lying

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
because there was a lot of low-lying

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.979 
because there was a lot of low-lying
branches<00:03:12.920> directly<00:03:13.730> overhead<00:03:13.970> you'll<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.959> I

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
branches directly overhead you'll see I

as I approached this pool I got down on
my<00:03:33.820> knees<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.720> was<00:03:34.930> less<00:03:35.170> visible<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:37.030> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
my knees so I was less visible and I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.510

my<00:03:44.560> head<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.640> had<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.000> do<00:03:46.120> sort<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.510> a

convincing that there had to be a fish
in<00:04:05.120> there<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.510> worked<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.350> for<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.560> few<00:04:06.830> minutes

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
in there I worked it for a few minutes

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.990 
in there I worked it for a few minutes
and<00:04:07.540> was<00:04:08.540> rewarded<00:04:08.750> when<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:10.000> nice

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
and was rewarded when this nice

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.280

cutthroat<00:04:12.640> took<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.790> Utah<00:04:14.090> killer<00:04:14.360> bug<00:04:14.630> it

cutthroat took the Utah killer bug it
was<00:04:15.410> really<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.680> good<00:04:15.890> sized<00:04:16.070> fish<00:04:16.100> for<00:04:16.700> this

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
was really a good sized fish for this

00:04:16.850 --> 00:05:03.740 
was really a good sized fish for this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
I was gonna hold him up so you could see

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.530 
I was gonna hold him up so you could see
him<00:05:07.380> better<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:07.860> he<00:05:08.460> wanted<00:05:08.820> out<00:05:08.970> of<00:05:09.000> there

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.970 

here<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.570> moved<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> different<00:05:16.530> section<00:05:16.740> of

here I moved to a different section of
the<00:05:17.070> stream<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.760> I<00:05:18.600> had<00:05:19.050> collapsed<00:05:19.350> my<00:05:19.590> rod

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
the rod and get back to casting

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.310 
the rod and get back to casting
