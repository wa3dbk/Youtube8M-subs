00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to be used over longer ranges it burns

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290 
to be used over longer ranges it burns
through<00:00:36.989> ammo<00:00:37.290> also<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.010> ridiculous<00:00:39.000> rate

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
through ammo also at a ridiculous rate

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
through ammo also at a ridiculous rate
making<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.750> sometimes<00:00:40.170> difficult<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.770> as

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920

mod<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.360> than<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.020> would<00:00:55.199> say<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
mod but more so than that I would say a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160 
mod but more so than that I would say a
heatsink<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> very<00:00:56.640> useful<00:00:57.120> helps<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
heatsink is very useful helps to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.369 
heatsink is very useful helps to
conserve<00:00:58.559> ammunition<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.370> also<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.600> magazine

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
conserve ammunition and also a magazine

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
conserve ammunition and also a magazine
upgrade<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.460> weapon<00:01:02.820> does<00:01:03.000> use

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
upgrade because this weapon does use

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.690 
upgrade because this weapon does use
ammo<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.690> rapidly<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.040> helpful<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ammo so rapidly it can be helpful to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030 
ammo so rapidly it can be helpful to
have<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.240> increased<00:01:06.689> clip<00:01:07.500> especially<00:01:07.979> if

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
have an increased clip especially if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
have an increased clip especially if
you'd<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.560> abilities

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you'd like to use this with abilities

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
you'd like to use this with abilities
like<00:01:10.710> marksmen<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> over<00:01:11.970> longer

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
like marksmen and use it over longer

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.080 
like marksmen and use it over longer
ranges<00:01:12.689> when<00:01:12.840> firing<00:01:13.049> from<00:01:13.170> cover<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.850> does

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
ranges when firing from cover it does

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020 
ranges when firing from cover it does
reload<00:01:15.390> quickly<00:01:15.540> though<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.430> one<00:01:17.430> clip<00:01:17.759> will

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
reload quickly though and one clip will

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
reload quickly though and one clip will
generally<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.900> enough<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> kill<00:01:19.680> most

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
generally be just enough to kill most

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.630 
generally be just enough to kill most
targets<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.750> least<00:01:21.900> most<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:23.130> unshielded

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
targets so at least most is unshielded

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.249 
targets so at least most is unshielded
of<00:01:23.939> red<00:01:24.090> bar<00:01:24.240> targets<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
of red bar targets that that is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.850 
of red bar targets that that is
something<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:25.890> keep<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.189> mind<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:27.860> would

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
something to also keep in mind I would

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
something to also keep in mind I would
not<00:01:29.040> use<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.490> scope<00:01:29.759> unless<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.329> intend<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> use

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
not use a scope unless you intend to use

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
cover over longer distances otherwise I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.830 
cover over longer distances otherwise I
really<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.790> feel<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> scope<00:01:36.720> is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
really do not feel that a scope is

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420 
really do not feel that a scope is
worthwhile<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.380> actually<00:01:37.680> detrimental<00:01:38.189> at

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
worthwhile is actually detrimental at

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
worthwhile is actually detrimental at
short<00:01:39.420> range<00:01:39.479> or<00:01:39.900> point-blank<00:01:40.439> range

and lastly ultralight materials are very

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.980 
and lastly ultralight materials are very
nice<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:44.939> weapon<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.390> much<00:01:45.780> heavier

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
nice for this weapon it is much heavier

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.260 
nice for this weapon it is much heavier
than<00:01:46.200> most<00:01:46.860> SMGs<00:01:47.159> still<00:01:48.060> lightweight

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
than most SMGs still lightweight

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.179

compared<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> many<00:01:49.079> weapons<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:50.040> be
