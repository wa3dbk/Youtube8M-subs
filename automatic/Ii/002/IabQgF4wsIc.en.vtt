00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.190
 of the new samsung galaxy of 6 and who 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.360
 better to tell us about 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.310
 this new smartphone that this card 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.020
 how was hello how are you how are you 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.640
 good night thank you very much for 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.110
 join us today in this 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.110
 spectacular launch 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 today we are launching the peru 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.879
 galaxy 16 and 16 the team in the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.710
 which we have dumped all our 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.710
 research and development to attract 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.570
 users the most beautiful team that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.220
 I have done samsung ever but at the same time 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.220
 the most powerful team in the world 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.140
 another part of the design that has 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.080
 purpose on samsung is the part 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.240
 after the team we made it 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.330
 same material as the screen that is the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.040
 glass gorilla glass 4 more resistant 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.710
 the gorilla glass generation and what 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.229
 we used on the back and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.479
 we have combined it with a sheet of 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.310
 color to give a feeling of 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.380
 immersion and shine but also 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.479
 returning to the subject the consumption the energy 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.690
 comes prepared for the cabin of the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.850
 goal directly I do not need to put you 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.100
 nothing additional for the phone 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.140
 can charge wirelessly 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.380
 using the different chargers 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.369
 wireless and all the standards that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.369
 currently used 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 in terms of screen has a 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.240
 5.1 inch screen 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.160
 which has quad hd technology 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.160
 super amoled but above all what 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.570
 highlights on the screen is the amount of 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.790
 pixels per inch that we could 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.820
 compress on the computer and I say this 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.330
 way so concentrated because the number 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.570
 it's really spectacular they are 577 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.830
 pixels per inch that we include in ls 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.720
 6 and 16 6 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.489
 just like 577 is 70% times more than what 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.000
 had the galaxy s 5 that already had a 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.440
 spectacular screen and approximately 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.560
 70% more than our principals 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.600
 competitors in this way we have the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.600
 best screen on smartphones 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.770
 we have inside each of these 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.170
 computers a 64-bit processor that does not 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.600
 only 64 bits which makes it more 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.280
 fast efficient but it is also 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.580
 produced with 14 technology 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.290
 nanometers which for practical purposes 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.530
 it means that it comes with the processor 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.950
 smaller fast and efficient the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.950
 industry 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.010
 who does not miss that in the morning 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.110
 leaving the house or in any 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.330
 moment leaving the office or 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.790
 any place we realize that 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.940
 just before leaving the smartphone it 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.440
 is running out of battery this samsung 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.310
 solves it in the following way 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.230
 we have included the ultra fast charge the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.830
 which is possible through the cells 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.660
 specials that brings the ls 6 16 6 plus a 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.970
 special charger that also comes 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.860
 included in the equipment box and this 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.530
 We will allow with only 10 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.420
 Load minutes count with 4 hours of 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.940
 use i'm rushed in the morning my 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.069
 phone is not charged while I take 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.639
 the coffee in 10 minutes I'm ready to 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.470
 go out and have 4 hours is to say more than 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.769
 all morning of my activities 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.769
 everyday 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.460
 the galaxy 16 and the s6 edge feature 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.410
 very advanced cameras not only in 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.720
 megapixel terms we have 5 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.580
 megapixels on the front 16 on the 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.370
 later that by itself is the amount 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.350
 ideal for a smartphone 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.639
 but also the main challenge that 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.180
 we had when we were developing 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.520
 the s6 was able to capture with the cameras 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.590
 images even in conditions of 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.550
 low light and for that what we have done 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.820
 it is installed joining a lens that has the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.330
 focal aperture of 1.9 and also the hr in 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.940
 real time in the back camera but 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.380
 also in the front camera you imagine 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.970
 have that in the front camera you can 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.150
 take the fis up in the conditions 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.009
 of light lower and not only will we be able to 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.720
 capture the dark training but 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.270
 that also between less speed there 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.430
 many super spontaneous situations that 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.130
 they happen in the day to day not a child 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.690
 doing some mischief or some adult 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.060
 in a somewhat anecdotal situation and 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.039
 we want to capture that image in the way 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.180
 faster not to lose moment is enough 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:36.860
 with pressing the button twice 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.100
 and the camera of 16 is activated in just 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.100
 0.7 seconds 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.290
 we invite you to experience the best 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.320
 world smartphone and the most smartphone 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.850
 beautiful created by samsung the samsung e6 and 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.850
 the jet samsung e6 xxi
