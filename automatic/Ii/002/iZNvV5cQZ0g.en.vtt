00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.170
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.210
 Easy chain tutorial France is today 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.090
 is found for a little tutorial that told me 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.860
 been sometimes asks and so the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.199
 last time I was asked 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.880
 said ok I'll do it to you who will you 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.430
 explain how to create your own 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.559
 custom thumbnail for your channel 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.930
 youtube for example 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.149
 so that would really be 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.010
 personalized miniatures of beginners 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.989
 it's really basic as what 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.390
 you could see on my channel 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.790
 there because most of the miniatures 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 personalized were made by myself 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.140
 as well as my banner and my intro so 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.600
 I will leave a link of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.059
 filter uploads in the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.059
 description and for that we will start 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.270
 this glitch so we'll take an example 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.600
 a silver blidge on gta 5 online you 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.850
 go to google in the images section 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.330
 selected minimum images of 1200 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:23.080
 by about 700 in guardian keeping 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:25.659
 this ratio the of dimension and to good 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.610
 to take a picture in theme is well in 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.189
 report with what you want 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.770
 present as much as to do it but 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.810
 then you will need low for me 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.430
 is going to be a gta 5 logo if possible late 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.040
 according to what you use after the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.159
 gaudin of a game or software or 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.979
 other so for me I take this logo 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.729
 so did it as much as possible to have 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.340
 a logo in fact on a plain background all this 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.189
 who will be 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.020
 drawing to add on something else to 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.950
 must be on a plain background 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.140
 Its very important 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.049
 so it's money or 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.609
 other then so go on 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.829
 photofiltre you are simply going 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.799
 go on file you laugh and open 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.650
 the background image that you chose a 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.599
 once you have this image of points 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.390
 so you're going back to open 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.390
 to choose a second image 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.489
 I will choose for example the battery 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.370
 of tickets so I took a background 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.250
 homogeneous enough so you're going to click 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.010
 on the little magic wand click 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.290
 on the bottom and then make a click 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.940
 right to reverse the selection 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.480
 and then you're going to copy so the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.360
 selection 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.660
 close your window go on the drawing 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.959
 of two basic background drawings and make 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.480
 paste to paste so the selection of 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.829
 country you chose it's going to be 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.170
 exactly the same method so for 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.269
 for the logo for everyone else 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.180
 design you see you would like 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.410
 imported for example a troll head 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.690
 a thing I do not know what then 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.400
 start again for logo I take again the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.280
 little magic wand I select 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 the bottom I have reverse the selection I 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.620
 copy my selection and I stick jordi 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 mentions roughly to the sizes that I 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.590
 wish and I validate the pose of the calq 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.239
 very important on this version there 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.220
 when you ask the cac you when you 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.400
 put the layer you put it for 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.160
 good then go low in the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.760
 text stuff to put a text 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.260
 so you will install the font of 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.120
 your choice just simply 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.470
 download pollution internet he 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.079
 you have to download it yourself 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 open it or click install so 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.480
 you select the font of your 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.819
 choice 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.880
 I took almost a man is 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:02.690
 that of GTA 5 to launch into the water 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.690
 general and I'm going m infinite money 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.660
 so you select the color that 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.670
 you want your text and you 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.100
 did it about the size of the 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.300
 text 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.370
 so I put you a size at the worst 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.490
 you will see what it gave to you 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.770
 just repaired the rest so you are not 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.370
 and 15 and 15 to the shadows to urge you to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.030
 your choice 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.650
 you put the color of the outline of the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.730
 text but you are a little blur effect 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.290
 it makes a little better and so there you 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.520
 see that it's pretty small so I put 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:54.700
 two are there it's too much rank we're going 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:54.700
 put 150 there is perfect 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:04.610
 then we will put a small 1.16 we will 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.200
 put you can choose so a 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.540
 other color and i'm going to show you the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.160
 fill pattern because you can 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.320
 put a pattern so you can 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.630
 look for other types of patterns on 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:21.020
 internet we're going to put 1.16 but this 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.360
 that I placed 100 points 16 years old you 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.440
 place the wind finally you place your 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.140
 writes as you wish and and 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.600
 here you see it's still 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.390
 relatively simple enough it's not 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.080
 super miniature custom top of 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.850
 range but for those who would not have 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.950
 fixed jets or someone who could 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.650
 help them do just that 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.690
 just small personal miniatures there 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.400

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.190
 just how you can do 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.210
 you even then you'll just have to 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.910
 register under their fame 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:06.110
 your your file well be careful 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:07.970
 to save it as jpg jpeg you

 click on save you put on 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.760
 max 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.530
