00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
wattage being 35 50 and 70 and what I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580 
wattage being 35 50 and 70 and what I
mean<00:00:38.489> by<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.570> put<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:40.110> awful

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
mean by that is they put out an awful

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.150 
mean by that is they put out an awful
lot<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> heat<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:42.329> awful<00:00:42.780> lot<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.170> UVA<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
lot of heat and an awful lot of UVA and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.959 
lot of heat and an awful lot of UVA and
UVB<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.660> wattage<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:47.010> comparing<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
UVB for the wattage so comparing that to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.750 
UVB for the wattage so comparing that to
a<00:00:48.120> Sun<00:00:48.450> force<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:49.309> like<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> mercury<00:00:50.730> vapour

a Sun force or like a mercury vapour
bulb<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.980> comparing<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> compact

bulb or comparing it to a compact
fluorescent<00:00:54.449> bulb<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:56.100> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
fluorescent bulb what you have is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
fluorescent bulb what you have is
something<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.449> incredibly<00:00:57.750> strong<00:00:58.710> for

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
something that's incredibly strong for

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.490 
something that's incredibly strong for
the<00:00:59.219> wattage<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> had<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> 70<00:01:00.960> watt<00:01:01.140> Sun

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the wattage so if you had a 70 watt Sun

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.700 
the wattage so if you had a 70 watt Sun
force<00:01:01.739> bulb<00:01:02.070> giving<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.000> 130<00:01:03.809> micro<00:01:04.260> watts<00:01:04.470> at

force bulb giving out 130 micro watts at
8<00:01:04.860> inches<00:01:05.100> you'll<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.210> something<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> 70

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
8 inches you'll have something like a 70

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.450 
8 inches you'll have something like a 70
watt<00:01:07.590> giving<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:09.090> 8<00:01:09.390> inches

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.190 
a sunny day that's a lot of UV in fact
that's<00:01:24.090> too<00:01:24.570> much

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that's too much

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
like the 50 watt closer to 16 inches

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.570 
like the 50 watt closer to 16 inches
which<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.900> 130<00:02:25.560> microwatts<00:02:26.100> that's<00:02:26.370> like<00:02:26.550> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
which is 130 microwatts that's like a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.500 
which is 130 microwatts that's like a
sunny<00:02:26.910> day<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.530> finally<00:02:28.530> had<00:02:28.710> 70<00:02:29.160> watts

you're<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.170> need<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.740> be<00:02:31.920> somewhere

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
you're going to need to be somewhere

you're going to need to be somewhere
between<00:02:33.080> 16<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.710> probably<00:02:35.040> 20<00:02:35.250> inches<00:02:35.760> at<00:02:35.940> 16

between 16 to probably 20 inches at 16
you're<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.630> 205<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.500> 20<00:02:38.160> or<00:02:38.340> 125<00:02:39.320> microwatts<00:02:40.320> so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
you're at 205 at 20 or 125 microwatts so

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.730 
you're at 205 at 20 or 125 microwatts so
again<00:02:41.430> these<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.270> very<00:02:42.570> strong<00:02:42.960> bulbs<00:02:43.410> they

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
again these are very strong bulbs they

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.770 
again these are very strong bulbs they
give<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> lot<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.460> heat<00:02:44.730> for<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.390> wattage

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
give out a lot of heat for the wattage

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.270 
give out a lot of heat for the wattage
because<00:02:46.080> they're<00:02:46.230> very<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.680> concentrated

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
because they're very very concentrated

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.070 
because they're very very concentrated
they<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.850> shoot<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.090> heat<00:02:48.510> down<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.990> they

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
they just shoot that heat down and they

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.560 
they just shoot that heat down and they
shoot<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.380> UV<00:02:49.890> beam<00:02:50.400> down<00:02:50.610> into<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.270> very

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
shoot that UV beam down into a very

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.960 
shoot that UV beam down into a very
specific<00:02:52.020> area<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.860> these<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.160> great<00:02:53.400> basking

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970

it<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.020> great<00:03:49.440> line<00:03:49.709> it's

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
it this is this is a great line it's

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.000 
it this is this is a great line it's
unique<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:51.270> again<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.140> really<00:03:52.410> have<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.890> be
