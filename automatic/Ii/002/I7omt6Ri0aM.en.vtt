exFAT<00:00:21.930> system<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.769> over<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> clean<00:00:23.400> space

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
exFAT system is an over the clean space

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.640 
exFAT system is an over the clean space
system<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.840> kind<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
system it's going to be kind of like the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
system it's going to be kind of like the
straitjackets<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
straitjackets it's going to be kind of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.630 
straitjackets it's going to be kind of
like<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> 2-tone<00:00:28.320> clean<00:00:28.529> cover<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.429> sense

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
like the 2-tone clean cover in the sense

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.609 
like the 2-tone clean cover in the sense
that<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.939> goes<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.510> your<00:00:30.630> cleats<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.439> going

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that it goes over your cleats it's going

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.020 
that it goes over your cleats it's going
to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> little<00:00:32.040> bit<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.340> an<00:00:32.550> ankle<00:00:32.850> brace

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to be a little bit like an ankle brace

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.160 
to be a little bit like an ankle brace
because<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.450> also<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> give<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170

additional support so let's take a look
at<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.809> box<00:00:36.989> says<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.590> quick<00:00:37.920> again

at what the box says really quick again

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.389 
at what the box says really quick again
it<00:00:39.420> talks<00:00:39.570> about<00:00:39.960> its<00:00:40.410> bio<00:00:40.890> mechanically

this<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.240> something<00:02:37.110> that's<00:02:37.200> integrated<00:02:37.950> so

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
this is something that's integrated so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.070 
this is something that's integrated so
the<00:02:38.970> good<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.330> about<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.840> it

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
the good thing about it is that it

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.900 
the good thing about it is that it
integrates<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.680> lot<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.160> things<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.580> are<00:02:41.730> in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
integrates a lot of things that are in

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.340 
integrates a lot of things that are in
traditional<00:02:42.330> braces<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.720> civically<00:02:42.990> first

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
traditional braces in civically first

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.350 
traditional braces in civically first
being<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.950> figure<00:02:44.250> eight<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.060> usually

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
being the figure eight that you usually

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.500 
being the figure eight that you usually
see<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.410> these<00:02:46.620> straps<00:02:46.920> here<00:02:47.220> make<00:02:48.210> up<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
see so these straps here make up the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.760 
see so these straps here make up the
figure<00:02:48.780> eight<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.730> would<00:02:50.940> find<00:02:51.180> in

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
figure eight that you would find in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.560 
figure eight that you would find in
something<00:02:52.770> like<00:02:52.890> ankle<00:02:53.310> tape<00:02:53.520> or<00:02:53.790> some<00:02:54.210> braces

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
something like ankle tape or some braces

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.390 
something like ankle tape or some braces
just<00:02:54.600> these<00:02:54.990> thin<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.710> straps<00:02:56.010> right<00:02:56.190> here

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
just these thin little straps right here

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.640 
just these thin little straps right here
so<00:02:57.030> they're<00:02:57.240> adjustable<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.320> sense<00:02:58.560> that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
so they're adjustable in the sense that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.590 
so they're adjustable in the sense that
they're<00:02:59.100> attached<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.550> these<00:02:59.640> bungee<00:03:00.270> cords

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
they're attached to these bungee cords

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.210 
they're attached to these bungee cords
or<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> could<00:03:01.350> actually<00:03:01.530> pull<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:04.220> you

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
or you could actually pull it and you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.340 
or you could actually pull it and you
can<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.490> pull<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.000> tighter<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.140> see

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
can actually pull it tighter you can see

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.260 
can actually pull it tighter you can see
how<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.560> stretches<00:03:08.490> that's<00:03:09.000> where<00:03:09.180> you're

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
how that stretches that's where you're

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.340 
how that stretches that's where you're
going<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:09.540> some<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.840> fine<00:03:10.110> tuning

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
going to get some of that fine tuning

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.800 
going to get some of that fine tuning
adjustment<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.820> also<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.210> going<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> wrap

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
adjustment it also is going to wrap

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.170 
adjustment it also is going to wrap
securely<00:03:13.290> wrap<00:03:13.530> your<00:03:13.680> angel<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.790> support

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
securely wrap your angel for support

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.110 
securely wrap your angel for support
right<00:03:15.390> here<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:17.250> has<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.459> hook<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.000> loop

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
right here it has the hook and loop

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.440 
right here it has the hook and loop
closure<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.750> goes<00:03:19.020> through<00:03:19.320> kind<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.739> like

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
closure that goes through kind of like

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.750 
closure that goes through kind of like
you<00:03:21.450> know<00:03:21.480> about<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:23.130> once<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.459> pull<00:03:23.640> it

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
you know about so once you pull it

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.880 
you know about so once you pull it
through<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.320> wrap<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> all<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.770> way

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
through then you wrap it all the way

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.680 
through then you wrap it all the way
around<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.640> looks<00:03:26.910> complicated<00:03:27.300> when<00:03:27.600> you

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
around it looks complicated when you

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.910 
around it looks complicated when you
look<00:03:27.870> at<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:28.230> once<00:03:28.410> you've<00:03:28.620> got<00:03:28.890> your

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
look at it but once you've got your

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.070 
look at it but once you've got your
cleat<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:29.840> really<00:03:30.840> simple

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
cleat in it it's really simple

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.720 
cleat in it it's really simple
self-explanatory<00:03:33.590> around<00:03:34.590> your<00:03:35.430> ankle

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
wrap not only for comfort but also

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.410 
wrap not only for comfort but also
because<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.190> going<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.400> stretch<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.970> it's

ankle<00:03:48.269> provide<00:03:48.540> no<00:03:48.810> gap<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:49.320> that's<00:03:49.890> kind<00:03:50.160> of

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
ankle provide no gap so that's kind of

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.880 
ankle provide no gap so that's kind of
how<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.850> outside<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.630> looks<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.470> also<00:03:52.620> has

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
how the outside of it looks it also has

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.009 
how the outside of it looks it also has
this<00:03:53.100> minor<00:03:53.730> adjustment<00:03:54.239> strap<00:03:54.510> which<00:03:54.720> didn't

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
this minor adjustment strap which didn't

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.070 
this minor adjustment strap which didn't
really<00:03:55.080> work<00:03:55.320> for<00:03:55.530> me<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:57.120> make<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
really work for me but to make it a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.960 
really work for me but to make it a
little<00:03:58.200> bit<00:03:58.410> tighter<00:03:58.650> around<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.790> back<00:03:59.940> of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
little bit tighter around the back of

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.750 
little bit tighter around the back of
your<00:04:00.180> cleat<00:04:00.450> if<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:01.019> need<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:02.640> know

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
your cleat if you need to I you know

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.370 
your cleat if you need to I you know
pulled<00:04:03.300> it<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.600> make<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.900> as<00:04:04.019> tight<00:04:04.170> as<00:04:04.290> it

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
pulled it to make it as tight as it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.330 
pulled it to make it as tight as it
could<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.709> there's<00:04:04.830> still<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> little<00:04:05.160> loose

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
could and there's still a little loose

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.610 
could and there's still a little loose
for<00:04:05.550> me<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.600> might<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.930> my<00:04:07.350> cleat

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
for me but that just might be my cleat

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.880 
for me but that just might be my cleat
so<00:04:07.860> now<00:04:09.620> let's<00:04:10.620> take<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.800> look<00:04:11.040> here<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.840> how<00:04:12.890> you

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
so now let's take a look here of how you

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.660 
so now let's take a look here of how you
actually<00:04:14.130> integrate<00:04:14.700> it

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.460 

into<00:04:18.670> your<00:04:18.820> cleat<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.420> here<00:04:19.660> in<00:04:19.750> my<00:04:19.870> laces<00:04:20.260> on

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
into your cleat so here in my laces on

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.230 
into your cleat so here in my laces on
the<00:04:20.650> CLE<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:21.280> can<00:04:21.400> see<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:21.790> goes<00:04:21.940> through

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the CLE you can see that it goes through

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.800 
the CLE you can see that it goes through
my<00:04:22.810> cleat<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.350> then<00:04:24.070> through<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.700> brace<00:04:24.910> so

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
my cleat and then through the brace so

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.840 
my cleat and then through the brace so
there's<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.380> can<00:04:26.560> count<00:04:26.830> there's<00:04:27.190> three

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
there's you can count there's three

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.020 
there's you can count there's three
different<00:04:28.380> eyelets<00:04:29.380> one<00:04:29.680> two<00:04:30.100> three<00:04:30.669> on<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
different eyelets one two three on the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.180 
different eyelets one two three on the
cleat<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.990> mistake<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.770> made<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.160> first

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
cleat the mistake that I made the first

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.340 
cleat the mistake that I made the first
time<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.180> last<00:04:34.450> three<00:04:34.810> eyelets<00:04:35.200> on

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
time is that the last three eyelets on

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.750 
time is that the last three eyelets on
the<00:04:35.500> shoe<00:04:35.680> are<00:04:35.889> not<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.340> ones<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.639> go

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
the shoe are not the ones that go

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.430 
the shoe are not the ones that go
through<00:04:37.000> here<00:04:37.150> you're<00:04:37.240> going<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.480> skip<00:04:37.720> one<00:04:37.900> so

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
through here you're going to skip one so

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.010 
through here you're going to skip one so
this<00:04:38.560> one<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:38.889> actually<00:04:39.070> not<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:40.020> anything

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
this one is actually not in anything

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.370 
this one is actually not in anything
through<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:43.060> know<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.389> bad<00:04:43.900> system<00:04:44.260> and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
through you know this bad system and

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.570 
through you know this bad system and
that's<00:04:44.500> because<00:04:44.770> it's<00:04:44.919> going<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.100> pull<00:04:45.340> up

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
that's because it's going to pull up

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.879 
that's because it's going to pull up
this<00:04:46.000> bad<00:04:46.240> system<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.840> back<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.650> cleat

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
this bad system to the back of the cleat

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.130 
this bad system to the back of the cleat
so<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.460> want<00:04:48.820> after<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.419> first<00:04:49.690> one<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.110> next

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
so you want after the first one the next

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.820 
so you want after the first one the next
three<00:04:50.620> are<00:04:50.770> going<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.160> go<00:04:51.310> through<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.840> this

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
three are going to go through it so this

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.950 
three are going to go through it so this
cost<00:04:54.100> about<00:04:54.310> thirty<00:04:54.790> nine<00:04:55.000> dollars<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.810> thing

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
cost about thirty nine dollars the thing

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.530 
cost about thirty nine dollars the thing
is<00:04:56.080> 39.99<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:57.160> safety<00:04:57.460> first<00:04:57.490> sports<00:04:57.970> and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
is 39.99 on safety first sports and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.120 
is 39.99 on safety first sports and
that's<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:59.169> for<00:04:59.350> one<00:04:59.560> you're<00:04:59.860> going<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.070> want
