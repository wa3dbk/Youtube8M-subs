00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 not just pasted steadily this here to 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.559
 I'll be better for you all the time 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:24.630
 push watch him knock 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:27.449
 resists getting see here i am 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 I press on him that is absolutely 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 honestly calmly here he stands on 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.239
 principle on the verge of if we come now 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.010
 Goal bend your knees a lot easier 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.219
 tass pick ahead oh easier 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 beloyar cool thing here I am also worth 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.149
 I will also need to move you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 calm what am i doing 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.309
 calmly 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.610
 but its not shift easily done 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.610
 which one 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.840
 its almost not normal all this is the other way around 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.420
 only well that is because there is no how 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:15.830
 I want this in principle, I will show how 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.830
 this move it one also get up all 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.710
 I will comment 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.190
 and we will comment on the technique itself 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.670
 what did I do then 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.100
 only you are watching stats any 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.530
 the physical body has its own 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.530
 oscillation frequency i am a physicist usually 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.780
 man in general a lot of any fluctuations 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.110
 inside Iâ€™m going to hide 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.730
 runs all pulsing 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.149
 there is a mass there is a density but there is some 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.369
 common 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.420
 the natural frequency of oscillation man 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.100
 any 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 any oscillation i.e. if physics 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.400
 remember you can spiral out 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.680
 let in gets all the fuss about man 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.959
 roughly speaking runs a certain 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.690
 sinusoid with a certain frequency 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:32.030
 constantly further what turns out average 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.360
 man there own sine wave than man 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.190
 doing something stronger or stretching 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.350
 led I leaf through yes that is all the strings 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 a sinusoid with greater frequency goes if 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.760
 why bedrock there as if not deflection 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 and here it would be in pain 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 bend I'm starting to catch this one 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.220
 frequency when I go tubercle that is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.019
 here it is up to sinusoid tubercle 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.660
 falls into the hand then I press me 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.100
 it turns out court response when 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.430
 I was expensive I press 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.170
 and catch up if adding resonance scribes 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.950
 much less power over here I have it already 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.830
 energy strictly speaking and that move 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.799
 It turned out the first time and from not calculated 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.150
 I told him myself under the bend tass not find 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.150
 took stretched out 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.120
 I have him once bump tubercle 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.870
 no way what I did the second time is from 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.660
 application areas yes how do i apply 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.750
 began to synchronize with its frequency 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.630
 how could he not go there but immediately pulled 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.550
 the infection here then these two frequencies lowered 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.640
 that it was possible to catch a hand 2 well 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.640
 quietly shift but that's another level
