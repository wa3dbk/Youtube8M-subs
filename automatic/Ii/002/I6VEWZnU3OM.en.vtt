00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello friends I will explain to you in this 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:12.550
 video a self-massage for the insertion of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.270
 the muscles scale us in the neck 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.270
 good 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.610
 do not 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.190
 or I said in the introduction that I follow you 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.800
 explain a self-massage for muscles 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.330
 Scalene in the neck but really not 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 it's in the neck where we're going to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.309
 perform the scalene if it comes from 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.010
 neck or come from the entire anterior area 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.160
 of this whole area of ​​the vertebrae 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 cervical and descend downward as 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.430
 I show with this piece of paper going on 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.970
 below the clavicle to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 inserted in the first and second 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.559
 ribs and in the area between both in the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.680
 intercostal zone 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 then the self massage as I tell you already 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.549
 it's not going to be in the cervical area in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.489
 neck but we 're going to do it in the 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:07.500
 area of ​​the ribs in the area of ​​the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 insertion in the ribs also 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.750
 we can do it here we can also 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 doing it on the clavicle is an area 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.030
 a little more conflictive because here 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.710
 the brachial plexus and other 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.450
 good is an area as I tell you more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 conflicting then that's why I prefer 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 also perform massage in the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.159
 insertion that is where you can do 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.689
 fibrosis and working this area we are going to 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.179
 a relaxation of muscle tone of all 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.729
 the whole muscle then like you 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.530
 I say if the muscle comes in this 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.179
 direction we're always going to do as in 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.020
 the case of any massage cydia this 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:47.359
 is a type cyriax massage it will 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.280
 do the friction also in a way 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.319
 cross to break a little bit the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.659
 fibrosis that may occur in these 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.479
 insertions since the scalene muscles 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.569
 they are very very very very muscles 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.090
 tonics are accessory muscles of the 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.099
 inspiration but they are also muscles that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.530
 Always hold from above 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.209
 costal grill I call you not for that 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.759
 the sword of damocles are the keepers 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.349
 from the fact that the costal grill never 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.019
 fall further down a certain level let's 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.989
 then to do the self massage like you 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.970
 he said cross-sectionally to the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.879
 direction of the fibers but first 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.560
 let's locate the point well let's 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.790
 search for it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.770
 here the clavicle that is this lump 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.810
 would be the head of the clavicle we can 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:44.630
 from this channel that is the area of 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.780
 sternum on both sides we have both 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.030
 heads of the clavicles and from there if 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.790
 we go down we will find 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.370
 we will fall to this hole would be the hole 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:01.220
 between the first and the second ribs 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.959
 then we will get to that gap and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.959
 let's make a friction 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.460
 and transversal deepening 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.350
 helping to weaken those fibrosis that 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.560
 can occur there in the tendon we can 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.300
 even go down to the area of ​​the second 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.489
 rib we can go more in closer 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.319
 of the sternum or more outwardly that is to say 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.380
 inside the space between the ribs 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.980
 We can be working here or we can 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.330
 work here or here on this entire channel 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:45.480
 worth even the entire rib and we're going to 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.550
 work there deeply 5 minutes 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.560
 it can be painful in some 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.540
 more people in people with anxiety 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.580
 It can be very painful because the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.099
 anxiety these muscles work very 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.590
 strongly pull very strong from that area 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.530
 of the ribs and are usually areas that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.660
 are irritated even very sensitive to 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.180
 touch now here in these cases more 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.400
 slowly more slowly but it can be 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.310
 in that sense very useful also for 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.079
 relax a bit that pressure in the area 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.430
 high chest I told you before that the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.039
 Taxes can not be worked too 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.280
 about the calculating is not looking for the 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.400
 clavicle and above we have the channel if 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.530
 there we can gently there with more 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.430
 respect because as I tell you , all the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.980
 brachial plexus 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.570
 it is a more conflictive zone but also 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:40.660
 you can work getting in there and work 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.780
 on the stairs with the hand of the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.950
 opposite side with the same side 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.010
 you can even make an inclination of 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.220
 the head so that the fingers can 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.640
 enter better in the scalene area 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.060
 in the area of ​​the clavicles put the 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.249
 fingers 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.789
 here it's worth 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.789
 i 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.680
 to tilt the head favors that 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.710
 work and you do a soft 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.280
 swaying movement breathing 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.110
 relaxing if according to this is a maneuver 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.230
 which can be very variable of some 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.120
 people to others in some was a lot 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.820
 more painful even bearable even 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.780
 they will not be able to work the area 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.670
 because the pain is excessive and good 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.890
 this is all I wanted to tell you 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.110
 on this subject I hope you find 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.910
