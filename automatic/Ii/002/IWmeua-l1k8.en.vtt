00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.550 

okay<00:02:08.080> see<00:02:09.080> what<00:02:09.289> we've<00:02:09.470> done

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.080 

and<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> skin<00:02:12.980> itself<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.670> peels<00:02:13.910> off

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and the skin itself just peels off

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.540 
and the skin itself just peels off
pretty<00:02:14.330> easy<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.630> like<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.930> start<00:02:15.200> right<00:02:15.470> at<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
pretty easy I like to start right at the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.630 
pretty easy I like to start right at the
bottom<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:16.970> move<00:02:17.120> right<00:02:17.150> along<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.519> know

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
bottom and move right along and you know

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.880 
bottom and move right along and you know
that<00:02:19.790> skin<00:02:20.120> even<00:02:20.450> covers<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.170> shell<00:02:21.440> itself

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
that skin even covers the shell itself

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.580 
that skin even covers the shell itself
to<00:02:22.160> prevent<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.730> from<00:02:22.930> oxidizing<00:02:23.930> mullets

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
to prevent that from oxidizing mullets

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.820 
to prevent that from oxidizing mullets
in<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.370> sea<00:02:25.580> water<00:02:26.200> otherwise<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.590> shell

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
in the sea water otherwise that shell

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.699 
in the sea water otherwise that shell
would<00:02:28.010> be<00:02:28.160> kind<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.459> like<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:29.380> roulade<00:02:30.380> or

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
would be kind of like a roulade or

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:39.190 
would be kind of like a roulade or
something<00:02:33.010> push<00:02:34.010> right<00:02:34.250> do

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.059 

right<00:02:39.560> you're<00:02:39.830> never<00:02:40.280> said<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.800> what<00:02:42.950> we're

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
right you're never said so what we're

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.880 
right you're never said so what we're
presented<00:02:43.459> with<00:02:43.489> once<00:02:44.209> we<00:02:44.390> get<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.660> here<00:02:45.140> is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
presented with once we get in here is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.440 
presented with once we get in here is
this<00:02:46.040> visceral<00:02:46.340> math<00:02:46.760> here<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.180> knows

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
this visceral math here it's knows

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.479 
this visceral math here it's knows
they're<00:02:47.720> kept<00:02:48.530> ball<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:48.890> can<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.400> it's

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
they're kept ball you can see that it's

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.890 
they're kept ball you can see that it's
got<00:02:49.610> their<00:02:49.730> gills<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.239> everything<00:02:50.599> all<00:02:50.810> the

got their gills and everything all the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.809 
got their gills and everything all the
reproductive<00:02:51.500> parts<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.190> also<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.610> can

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
reproductive parts that also you can

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.240 
reproductive parts that also you can
just<00:02:52.970> kind<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.209> squeeze<00:02:54.020> off<00:02:54.349> front<00:02:54.890> squeeze

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
just kind of squeeze off front squeeze

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.960 
just kind of squeeze off front squeeze
off<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.580> back<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.020> rest<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.380> here<00:02:57.970> it's

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970

it's their mantle it's really fatty it's
actually<00:03:11.150> fattier<00:03:11.420> than<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> razor<00:03:11.930> clam

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
actually fattier than like a razor clam

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.550

stuff
but<00:03:18.860> what<00:03:19.010> are<00:03:19.100> we<00:03:19.190> going<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.549> with<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.940> all

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
but what are we going to do with it all

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.820 
but what are we going to do with it all
right<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.690> now<00:03:20.989> we're<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.170> going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.500> do<00:03:21.620> some

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
right so now we're just going to do some

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.130 
right so now we're just going to do some
thin<00:03:22.069> slices<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.700> because<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.750> such<00:03:24.110> a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
thin slices of it because it is such a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.759 
thin slices of it because it is such a
strong<00:03:24.470> muscle<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.130> tends<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:27.470> has<00:03:27.739> a

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
strong muscle it tends to be it has a

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.490 
strong muscle it tends to be it has a
really<00:03:28.040> interesting<00:03:28.239> characteristic<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.330> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
really interesting characteristic to the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.780 
really interesting characteristic to the
profile<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.680> where<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:31.010> ends<00:03:31.250> up<00:03:31.340> having<00:03:31.580> a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
profile that where it ends up having a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.860 
profile that where it ends up having a
little<00:03:31.940> bit<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.090> like<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.239> crunch<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.840> a

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
little bit of like a crunch like a

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.470 
little bit of like a crunch like a
cucumber<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.010> what<00:03:34.130> we<00:03:34.250> do<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.549> we<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:34.910> slice

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
cucumber so what we do is we just slice

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.420 
cucumber so what we do is we just slice
it<00:03:35.510> right<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.870> half<00:03:36.019> like<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.739> then<00:03:37.280> we

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
it right in half like this and then we

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.430 
it right in half like this and then we
do<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.760> thin<00:03:38.120> slices<00:03:39.160> kind<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.220> at<00:03:40.340> an<00:03:40.459> angle

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
do to thin slices kind of at an angle

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.990 
do to thin slices kind of at an angle
and<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.950> stuff<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.280> great<00:03:43.670> sushi

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
and this is the stuff that great sushi

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.910 
and this is the stuff that great sushi
bars<00:03:44.390> are<00:03:44.630> made<00:03:44.660> up<00:03:46.630> all<00:03:47.630> right<00:03:47.870> then<00:03:48.560> we<00:03:48.650> plate

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
bars are made up all right then we plate

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.390 
bars are made up all right then we plate
