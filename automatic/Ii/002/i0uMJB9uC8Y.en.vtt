length limit for commands and command

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.770 
length limit for commands and command
block<00:02:08.080> was<00:02:08.440> removed<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.090> even<00:02:10.630> more

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
block was removed and we have even more

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.800 
block was removed and we have even more
new<00:02:11.380> commands<00:02:11.829> that<00:02:12.220> are<00:02:12.280> able<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:13.329> get<00:02:13.510> used

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
new commands that are able to get used

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.470 
new commands that are able to get used
now<00:02:14.079> in<00:02:14.110> command<00:02:14.620> blocks<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:16.329> was<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
now in command blocks but it was a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.270 
now in command blocks but it was a
rather<00:02:16.720> small<00:02:16.989> snapshot<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> average

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
rather small snapshot for the average

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.490 
rather small snapshot for the average
user<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.030> think<00:02:19.329> that's<00:02:19.510> okay<00:02:19.840> because<00:02:20.079> we

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
user but I think that's okay because we

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500 
user but I think that's okay because we
