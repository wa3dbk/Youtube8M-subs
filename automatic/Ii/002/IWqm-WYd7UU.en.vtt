00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.340
 Hello, friends 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.520
 good this video we do 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.619
 so you can identify with a game of the institution 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.209
 It's totally new 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.929
 the quality assurance seal 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.049
 the mercantile of jaÃ©n 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.300
 good are four characteristics that we have to take garcia highlighted 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 100% 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.069
 title background 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.149
 you made a good scare this could be more easily identified 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.989
 because for example 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.390
 suppose that this produces sadness 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.780
 here would bring an efficiency and common 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.300
 like every woman 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.290
 but good 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.590
 in playstation 3 this was no longer done 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.110
 we do not know which side 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.490
 most likely it was done by 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
 for saving money I do not know 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.670
 the first characteristics 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.170
 we use all 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.650
 our little finger 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.920
 put it in the part where the game opens 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.950
 here we are going to enter the little finger 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.370
 in the plastic as there are two doubles 6 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.940
 there is a small space 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.030
 and there we all enter it 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.460
 that's the first feature 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 over here we have another game are two the dead 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.420
 We're also 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.360
 and we also do the same 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 the same procedure and also as colombia 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.390
 well that's our first feature the second 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.580
 we can find it 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.960
 they are four parts 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.890
 they are 4 x that is unmarked 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 are two Xs that must be marked the carribar 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.510
 and two ex how to mark acapulco 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.200
 it is so they are marked by the oaks that they do when they followed the villages 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.380
 here you will not notice much because 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.420
 in fact 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 this one does not show much but good the towns tas 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.000
 to see if I can be here 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.050
 they only marked the famous x musician 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.640
 that is our second characteristic 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 the third the process is easier to identify the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.420
 for the kind of democratic center they use to 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.880
 seal the games 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.939
 then later you feel in the pact 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.449
 to another type of fire to not 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.059
 hop the tic or that they use another type of people that was in used games 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.289
 that is our 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.289
 third feature 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.099
 and our fourth and last feature 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.239
 we can identify this very easily by 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.269
 percent in a crow signaled the reseal 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.489
 because sometimes he has small bourgeoisites here 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.859
 in the corners 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.609
 what would they do in 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.519
 of game received here are not noticed because he witnessed the game the game 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.319
 it comes like this totally 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.679
 packaged and well made 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.339
 and in the building it's our turn to meet or we meet with a 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.639
 resealing would celebrate the bourgeoisie here and that his to package 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.599
 well since you guys this car that most of all we're stupid because 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.219
 because nobody guarantees us that a game 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.369
 that was used and reviewed again 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.799
 Come the debut album but do not hide shredded that you lack soul 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.209
 or anything or that the box of losada or anything else like that 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.439
 we stayed for what item those little jokes and their problems 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.919
 and think that they have been three times that I find this type of games 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.219
 reseller once 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.219
 what they do is grab used games or yes 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.349
 and then he feels and I tell them with the plastic 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.329
 by the finger that I tell you that I'm afraid is that mechel by the x that are marked 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.629
 up and down 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.929
 and also by the edges that I say 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.989
 and then later it shows and then in fact once 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.619
 and you are looking for the valuable 2 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:47.709
 in a shop 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.730
 and in a store if they were new like this 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.319
 totaly new 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.499
 and they were leaving me like 400 pesos 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.909
 what they are like about 40 dollars 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.439
 and then that crime game was in another time 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.439
 a store was from their places where in games 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.129
 sbs put in 550 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.049
 and that would do 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.569
 rice were no longer 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.810
 luli in a little bit that time they left more expensive used sportsman 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.569
 that's all today 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.629
 and then nothing more summarizing the first because they do not know the finger 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.319
 no test the little finger in the psyche above the little girl under 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.409
 type of patients 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.129
 and you can also the bourgeois 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.719
 that come totally 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.059
 that you do not notice in the corners os xy that serve 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:39.580
 and then that is all 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.909
 have a world 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.930
 mundialito explained thank you for your purchases
