00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello, how are my neighbors killed ? 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 upstairs they are playing music for 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.370
 like five hours I would be angry but in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.080
 music reality that I like it 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
 will ask why we have lived the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.830
 last week and why is I am 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.809
 going up two or three days late and it's 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.060
 because I'm on vacation at the time 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.189
 shine or at least to make life 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.590
 social when I'm not sleeping 12 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.990
 hours this video is a collaboration already 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.970
 that the makeup part and the stalker 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
 will do the part of nails and I will leave you a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.779
 link for that at the end of this video 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 I wanted to do something dramatic a makeup 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 really with a Christmas tree if 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.579
 they want me to do a tutorial of something 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 truly usable or less traumatic can I 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.750
 do it but let's be honest dramatic 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 it's more fun so I do not understand why 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.530
 what they have a usable especially 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 so he does not have colorful hair like 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.120
 I here already applied the first tale is very 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 important that you use a primer to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.879
 that the shadows are not going to run 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.920
 then metro l1 and l4 of the tub that are 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 just a matt white and a white 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.300
 pearled and I'm going to apply it under the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.970
 eyebrow arch as illuminator with a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.310
 coffee 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.890
 warm medium and brush 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.080
 blur I'm going to apply it in the basin 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.570
 do not worry if they arrive very 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.090
 up or if they touch the mobile eyelid 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.040
 there is no problem and for the eyelid 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.440
 mobile I'm going to use this gold of 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.860
 latina and that vibrant yellow of things 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.860
 sense 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.609
 I will use a little bit of this coffee with 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.619
 a brush blur smaller and what 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.200
 I'll put in the basin or above the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.600
 basin and again blur everything with the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.159
 jumbo and thought there's an angular gap I'm going 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.229
 to make a line at the bottom 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.569
 it does not have to be perfect and it does not matter 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.700
 If it's not so thin, you can do it with 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.049
 thick you want if it has that 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.939
 sense 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.429
 and on top of that apply a vibrant green and so on 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.709
 it's what it looks like now I'll take one more green 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.679
 dark to give more definition and what 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.899
 I'm going to apply in a diagonal line to 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.149
 that comes out a little bit and also for 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.250
 get right in the middle and blur a 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.170
 little in the middle ends the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.079
 eye makeup with a delineated with 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.179
 tail and a lot of little eyelash at the same time 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.360
 use this prohibition micos meres 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.670
 or use any eye and it helped me 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.829
 always a brush of a little bit of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.829
 bronzer and pretty natural favor 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.530
 and that's all, although I feel that in the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.540
 camera does not look as good as in life 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.300
 real because let me tell you that in the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.070
 real life half fabulous seriously I hope 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.600

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.660
