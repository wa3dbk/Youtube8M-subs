00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.609
 chess 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.350
 the rule of the square one of the concepts 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.480
 most important at the end of the game 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.610
 involving pedestrians is called the rule of 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.019
 square 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.510
 if the king is within the square of a 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.900
 spinning top he can capture it and prevent its 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.670
 promotion with safety 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.349
 let's look at this position and look at the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.279
 square that pedestrians formal to their 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.400
 around 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.400
 both for the pawn in ag and in h 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 if the white river could enter the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.360
 black pawn square 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.490
 so it can prevent your promotion the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.520
 same goes for the King I intend to square 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.010
 of the white pawn the two kings are out 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.930
 of the opponents pedestrians but there are 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 a detail is the turn of white 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.100
 now as we can see the white river is 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.240
 in the square of the black pawn and can capture 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.950
 No problem 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 unlike the opponent the black pawn 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 advances in its square decreases 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.280
 however the white river is willing to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:37.410
 follow and prevent them from promoting the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.410
 black pawn continues to attend the promotion 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.500
 play now obvious even taking the pawn 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.450
 got the promotion 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.450
 he is normally captured by the king 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.079
 now the race on the other side of the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.969
 board between the black and white king 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.259
 knowing the rule of the square you already 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.259
 know who wins this dispute 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:15.739
 reiner 7 pawn at 7 6 and 7 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.049
 finally pawn and a8 and promotion 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.209
 now checkmate the question of time and 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.920
 player's ability with white 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.989
 remember to pay attention to the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.989
 squares in the finals between kings and pawns
