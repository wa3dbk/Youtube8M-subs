aim<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.829> sights<00:00:55.370> it's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> bullpup<00:00:56.760> weapon<00:00:57.180> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
aim down sights it's a bullpup weapon so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
aim down sights it's a bullpup weapon so
it's<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> augen<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> goes<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it's kind of like the augen it goes to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.510

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.020 

really<00:01:32.780> going<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.229> right<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:34.130> um<00:01:34.549> I

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
really going to the right like um I

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.420
