00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello friends talk to them harbitz and I give them 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.669
 welcome to 1000 curiosities of the 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.620
 videogames chapter 22 remembering ago 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.509
 little we talk about saint row box 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.339
 what we said they could find says 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.599
 certain costumes that I'm going to do 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.550
 reference to other games 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.410
 Well, something I did not mention is that 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.350
 you can also find a costume 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790
 django fit of the movie star wars 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.950
 although the disguise itself bears the name 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.330
 of ramsés shawn hunter obviously for 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.730
 not infringe any copyright 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.470
 good since we are seeing curiosities 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.080
 of past videos because we do not go back to 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.180
 put gear solid 3 even more 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.550
 specifically again the battle with 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.350
 seeing before we saw a way 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.050
 alternative to defeat well waiting 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.820
 to die of old but there is another 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.340
 way besides just fighting 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.050
 against him good so you give me guide solís 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.760
 he does not like much this character seems 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.410
 because there is another way to kill him 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.480
 before having to fight against him like 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.550
 boss since in the game you 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.770
 you find it right before you have to 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.540
 vilar against him as boss although that is not 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.430
 it was the original intention within this 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.909
 encounter it is possible to kill someone 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.499
 using a very specific weapon to center 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.070
 in this instance you have to go through 

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.470
 One Way 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.420
 by which you can take a detour from the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.659
 left and enter an area called 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.400
 ponies of the west in this place there is a 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.770
 room where you can find a rifle 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.080
 of sniper called that baby if 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.580
 you pick up this rifle and you take it off just 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.750
 before entering the area because once 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.280
 you find the area you're going to 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.619
 find with a kinematics of 20 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.350
 minutes and just finish the cinematic 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.850
 do the sniper rifle you point to 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.070
 place where it is good and you can 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.290
 shoot straight in the head and well 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.240
 has explosives placed on the body 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.830
 being made to detonate as soon as the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.479
 die so when I shot you 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.520
 will cause an explosion that will kill the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.570
 other guards and it will also cause a 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.240
 of the wheels of your wheelchair 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.619
 fly out and I hit you and in fact the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.350
 damage of those wheels and this is a 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.119
 Very high difficulty can kill you but 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.740
 it was the old man and once he has 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.590
 is dead you will not have to face 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.539
 him later in the hd collection of 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.550
 metal gear solid 'you can get a 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.190
 trophy for doing this thing called the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.110
 premature ending or the hero liendo and 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.840
 now let's go to super mario bros or better 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.820
 said new super luigi and this was a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 game released for the wiiu which is a 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.030
 mario bros game but instead of being 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.970
 Mario 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.290
 main is luigi this was thrown 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 because the 2013 those of nintendo 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.640
 declared that it was the year of Luigi in the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.230
 which decided to finally give it something of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.360
 recognition of one of the dishes 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.100
 best known of video games and what 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.440
 better way to celebrate this than 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.500
 putting images of him inside everything 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.180
 the game since within the game in each 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.580
 level each and every level 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.860
 there is a hidden image of luigi in some 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.420
 Some are more hateful than others 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.220
 some are bigger facts of 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.750
 different things are not shadows other 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.760
 things but the things that each of the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.650
 levels contains at least one image 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.380
 of luigi that he can find by 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.900
 there and in total they make 86 hidden images 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.280
 within the whole game and since we're 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.769
 talking about mario because we're not going to 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.840
 talk about super mario 3d land at 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.850
 beginning of the level it is possible to find 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.700
 some binoculars which you can use 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.280
 if you wait 45 minutes and look for them 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.230
 towards the sky it will be possible to see well that 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.120
 someday a UFO flying through the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.709
 good sky then change 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.319
 completely on topic and let's talk 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.269
 now from a little dead space inside 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.040
 of the jet space it is possible to find the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.189
 windows logo in 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.319
 a window this window has the form 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.450
 and the typical colors of the logo 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.189
 windows when you see the light go through it and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.049
 projecting on the floor you can see him 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.730
 clearly that is a reference to 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.959
 operating system but that's not the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.700
 only reference that can be found 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.890
 you can also find references 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.629
 to other video games you can also 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.659
 find a poster for a game 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.599
 called skate 3000 obviously a 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.280
 reference to skate games 3 this 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.010
 product that both games are 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.049
 published by the game but the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.480
 references work for both sides 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.549
 since the skate 3 is possible to unlock 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.859
 the character of aysa clear that the 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.450
 main character of dead space for 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.760
 unlock this cameo what you have to 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.950
 to do is enter the menu and select the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.750
 option that allow you to put codes and 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.810
 then simply place the words 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.169
 dead space to you as you want to say 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.810
 also not your fingers so in Spanish 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.819
 would be like dead space too and so from 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.799
 simple you will have aisa clark as 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.450
 unlocked character to be able to use it 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.910
 inside the tracks 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.740
 and finally within this episode it 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.350
 You can find a reference of dead 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.320
 space in another game this game is 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.880
 know is also published by i game 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.040
 but good the reference is in 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.230
 one of the multiplayer maps is the map 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.990

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.850
 that come with the game the lcs after 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.950
 match and what you have to do is 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.840
 just take a sugar and the 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.210
 destroy a wall and you can 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.370
