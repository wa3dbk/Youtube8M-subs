00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
going over the edge hmmm so that looks

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.060 
going over the edge hmmm so that looks
ready<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> come<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:36.590> comes<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.740> very

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
attach the piece of lace now when I put

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.000 
attach the piece of lace now when I put
it<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.030> I'm<00:03:55.209> going<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.480> put<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.140> as<00:03:56.260> close<00:03:56.650> as<00:03:56.890> I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
it on I'm going to put it as close as I

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.120 
it on I'm going to put it as close as I
can<00:03:57.870> tightly<00:03:58.870> up<00:03:59.380> to<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.459> previous<00:04:01.000> piece<00:04:02.130> so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
can tightly up to the previous piece so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.220 
can tightly up to the previous piece so
it's<00:04:03.310> easy<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.910> blend<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:06.070> edges<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.640> together

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
it's easy to blend the edges in together

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.990 
it's easy to blend the edges in together
so<00:04:09.230> just<00:04:09.470> need<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.710> check<00:04:09.980> that's<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.730> yes

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
so just need to check that's it yes

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.420 
so just need to check that's it yes
that's<00:04:11.240> in<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.540> right<00:04:11.660> place<00:04:12.020> so<00:04:12.650> these<00:04:12.890> these

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
that's in the right place so these these

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.900 
that's in the right place so these these
two<00:04:13.760> pieces<00:04:14.180> here<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:15.220> might<00:04:16.220> just<00:04:16.579> put<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
two pieces here I might just put a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.789 
two pieces here I might just put a
little<00:04:17.269> bit<00:04:17.390> more<00:04:17.600> icing<00:04:18.079> onto<00:04:18.260> there<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.739> to

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
little bit more icing onto there just to

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.410 
little bit more icing onto there just to
make<00:04:18.859> sure<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.190> stays<00:04:19.670> in<00:04:20.030> place

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
make sure it stays in place

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.560 
make sure it stays in place
forty-two<00:04:23.420> nozzle<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.820> just<00:04:25.820> brush<00:04:26.210> the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
edges close together I use this rather

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.210 
edges close together I use this rather

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220 
than just pressing with my finger
because<00:04:31.550> my<00:04:32.060> finger<00:04:32.390> would<00:04:32.450> flatten<00:04:32.990> out<00:04:33.110> the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
because my finger would flatten out the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.410 
because my finger would flatten out the
pattern<00:04:33.560> I'm<00:04:33.950> going<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.370> attach<00:04:34.670> a<00:04:34.880> bow<00:04:35.060> here

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
and so you won't really see the join as

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.830 
and so you won't really see the join as
much<00:04:39.620> anyway<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:41.240> need<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.690> put<00:04:41.810> some
