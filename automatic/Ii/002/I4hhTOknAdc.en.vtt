00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
to connect our battery of course what we

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.030 
to connect our battery of course what we
need<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.750> battery<00:00:04.529> cable<00:00:06.020> solder<00:00:08.570> lug<00:00:10.040> notice

there's<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.490> slot<00:00:11.880> at<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.630> top<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> leg

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
there's a slot at the top of the leg

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.260 
there's a slot at the top of the leg
here<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:15.929> blowtorch<00:00:16.670> okay<00:00:17.670> so

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
here and the little blowtorch okay so

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.090 
here and the little blowtorch okay so
first<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:20.490> measure<00:00:20.760> up

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
first of all what we do we measure up

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.910 
first of all what we do we measure up
the<00:00:23.100> depth<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.840> lug<00:00:25.760> we<00:00:26.760> then<00:00:27.710> strip<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the depth of the lug we then strip the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.660 
the depth of the lug we then strip the
wire<00:00:32.329> we<00:00:33.329> insert<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> wire<00:00:34.460> into<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.489> lug

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
wire we insert the wire into the lug

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
wire we insert the wire into the lug
while<00:00:38.670> twisting<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> get<00:00:40.410> most<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
while twisting it you get most of the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
while twisting it you get most of the
wires<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.120> miss<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.809> bit<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
wires in if you miss a little bit it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
wires in if you miss a little bit it
doesn't<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.440> matter<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> much<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:45.030> can

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
doesn't really matter that much you can

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.010 
doesn't really matter that much you can
always<00:00:45.329> cut<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.780> off<00:00:45.930> after<00:00:47.329> okay<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.780> then

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
always cut them off after okay and then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.119 
always cut them off after okay and then
if<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> vice<00:00:50.629> put<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.960> wire<00:00:52.590> with

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
if you have a vice put your wire with

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
if you have a vice put your wire with
the<00:00:53.160> login<00:00:53.730> device<00:00:54.260> standing<00:00:55.260> upright<00:00:55.469> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the login device standing upright like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.540 
the login device standing upright like
this<00:00:55.949> or<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> haven't<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:58.250> just<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> pair

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
this or if you haven't use just a pair

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
this or if you haven't use just a pair
of<00:00:59.640> vise<00:00:59.820> grips<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:04.140> hold<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.500> wire<00:01:04.710> into

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
of vise grips and to hold a wire into

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.620 
of vise grips and to hold a wire into
place<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.860> now<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:09.030> heat<00:01:09.510> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
place and now what we do is we heat I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.280 
place and now what we do is we heat I
love<00:01:13.939> just<00:01:14.939> around<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> base<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.110> want

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
love just around the base of it you want

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.070 
love just around the base of it you want
to<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> fairly<00:01:16.860> nice<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.400> hot<00:01:17.900> while<00:01:18.900> we

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to get it fairly nice and hot while we

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
to get it fairly nice and hot while we
do<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.830> our<00:01:20.009> solar<00:01:20.340> ready<00:01:25.580> okay<00:01:26.580> just

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
do that we get our solar ready okay just

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.399 
do that we get our solar ready okay just
a<00:01:27.720> bad<00:01:27.900> enough<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.240> put<00:01:30.420> our<00:01:30.540> solar<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
a bad enough and we put our solar in the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.090 
a bad enough and we put our solar in the
top<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> slot<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.990> we'll<00:01:34.799> wait<00:01:34.950> till

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
top of the slot here and we'll wait till

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890 
top of the slot here and we'll wait till
it<00:01:35.220> starts<00:01:35.610> melting<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.750> keep

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it starts melting and we just keep

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.649 
it starts melting and we just keep
adding<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.729> more<00:01:38.880> solar<00:01:41.420> while<00:01:42.420> we're

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
adding more and more solar while we're

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.710 
adding more and more solar while we're
heating<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> try<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.390> much

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
heating we want to try and get as much

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.310 
heating we want to try and get as much
in<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.500> possibly<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in there as we possibly can so we get a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.950 
in there as we possibly can so we get a
nice<00:01:49.560> solid<00:01:50.040> connection<00:01:50.759> neck<00:01:52.610> okay<00:01:53.659> see<00:01:54.659> how

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
nice solid connection neck okay see how

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.120 
nice solid connection neck okay see how
the<00:01:55.430> solar<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.729> keeps<00:01:56.939> flowing<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.570> there

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the solar just keeps flowing in there

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.080 
the solar just keeps flowing in there
eventually<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.310> come<00:01:59.369> down<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
eventually it will come down to the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350 
eventually it will come down to the
bottom<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:01.680> we'll<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> nice<00:02:02.430> solid

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
bottom and then we'll have a nice solid

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.920 
bottom and then we'll have a nice solid
little<00:02:04.159> connection

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
little connection

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.300 
little connection
was<00:02:06.080> very<00:02:06.290> very<00:02:06.470> important<00:02:08.860> was<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.130> don't

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
was very very important was we don't

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.110 
was very very important was we don't
want<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.670> come<00:02:10.789> up<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:12.790> right<00:02:13.790> that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
want it to come up at all right that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.150 
want it to come up at all right that
will<00:02:14.270> just<00:02:14.300> about<00:02:14.570> there<00:02:15.050> there<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:15.770> turn<00:02:16.010> off

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
will just about there there we turn off

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.420 
will just about there there we turn off
our<00:02:16.340> torch<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:20.150> let<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.450> cool<00:02:20.630> down<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.900> bit

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
our torch and we let it cool down a bit

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.060 
our torch and we let it cool down a bit
and<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:23.270> soon<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.630> cool<00:02:23.840> down<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.380> put<00:02:24.709> our

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
and as soon as cool down we put our

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.830 
and as soon as cool down we put our
shrink<00:02:25.550> wrap<00:02:25.760> on<00:02:27.580> heat<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.760> up<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.150> finish<00:02:29.630> our

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
shrink wrap on heat it up and finish our

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.949 
shrink wrap on heat it up and finish our
connection<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:35.020> here<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:37.720> what<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.840> finished

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
connection and here is what the finished

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.840 
connection and here is what the finished
product<00:02:39.440> looks<00:02:39.500> like<00:02:39.739> shrink<00:02:40.160> wrap<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.640> there

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
product looks like shrink wrap on there

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.660 
product looks like shrink wrap on there
and<00:02:41.030> not<00:02:41.239> sneak<00:02:41.540> connection<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.890> now<00:02:43.370> we're

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
and not sneak connection and now we're

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.500 
and not sneak connection and now we're
ready<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.940> connect<00:02:44.390> up<00:02:44.570> their<00:02:44.780> battery
