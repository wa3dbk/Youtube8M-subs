00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.200 
doing other things and also you can do
this<00:04:57.830> in<00:04:57.950> a<00:04:58.010> minute<00:04:58.130> thirty<00:04:58.460> like<00:04:58.790> if<00:04:58.910> we<00:04:59.000> don't

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
this in a minute thirty like if we don't

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.810 
this in a minute thirty like if we don't
straight<00:04:59.600> into<00:04:59.930> doing<00:05:00.200> this<00:05:00.580> we<00:05:01.580> could<00:05:01.730> have

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
straight into doing this we could have

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.570 
straight into doing this we could have
been<00:05:01.970> done<00:05:02.240> by<00:05:02.480> now<00:05:02.920> so<00:05:03.920> this<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.370> definitely

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
been done by now so this is definitely

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
similar if you remember it's the one

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.390 
similar if you remember it's the one

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
can be even more ballsy in that one if

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.200
