00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.130
 us in our conferences 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.290
 missionaries we address this issue and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.210
 we say so my brothers all 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.020
 we are missionaries 1 are the ones who go 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.520
 do 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.980
 the preaching of the gospel in the most 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.100
 and the church keeps contributing to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.029
 with several distant missionaries and there 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.070
 we say we are missionaries who 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.219
 we do mission here in our local but 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.660
 let him talk 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.640
 I've been talking about some controversial things. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.570
 in recent days and this will also be a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.850
 a controversial expression and because of this 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.760
 we have been attacked in our 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.219
 Our site is part of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.370
 part but lets him talk about this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.570
 concept in my opinion is wrong 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.570
 local resignation 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.520
 I would venture to say that the vast majority 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.559
 those who justify themselves by saying okay 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 Right, I 'm not going to the mission I do not speak 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 from jesus out there but I'm one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.680
 local missionary here on the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.520
 my workplace 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 most is not no, this is not a car 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.939
 justification and comes to be almost a car 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.610
 mistake most sadly of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 Christians my brothers and I would like 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.920
 that you were not in this statistic 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.189
 not a local missionary does not speak of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.110
 Jesus in his environment does not witness 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 invites do not preach do not take time 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.900
 speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ as His 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.040
 Savior are not good professionals 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.590
 perform their duties well but are not 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.450
 in love, your heart does not burn by 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 lord jesus christ 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.780
 many brothers and in my opinion 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 controversy most do not read the word the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.369
 your friends do not use Bible texts to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.159
 confront sin 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.030
 many in the vast majority of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.110
 gospels in Brazil is not a 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.629
 local missionary is the missionary 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 place but the local missionary is 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.260
 without 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 open the words of praying for your 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.770
 worry about your friends without hurting 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.680
 in your heart the sin they commit 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.270
 against the glory of the Lord 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 without regret even people who 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.120
 we live with them going to hell 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 and many are dying daily without 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.840
 even hear the gospel and then we 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.010
 we think that being ethical we are 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 missionaries who, while having a 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.490
 moral in our practices are 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.200
 missionaries 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.770
 I risk my opinion again 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.870
 controversy this is not being missionary 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.910
 because so many non-Christians do 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.540
 this and sometimes they do better than we 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.250
 And then it 's to our shame then I 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.720
 I would like to bring this 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.240
 this concept of being a missionary 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.740
 local 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.140
 I want to believe that we have a potential 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.510
 too strong for that because we have the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.580
 word we have the knowledge we have 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.830
 heritage we have the masters who 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.050
 have taught us the conditions of 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.840
 be constantly taught to 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.430
 we actually go out and occupy this which is a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:34.830
 space that you gave to your 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.400
 disciples for them to walk but I imagine 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.380
 in the reading that I do is that we are 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.680
 light years says 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:48.080
 and because what happens to us then 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.610
 I mean it's possible we 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.450
 Let's start praying that's what I was going to say. 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:59.370
 Sir, I'm someone here, I can. 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.269
 to be used by you here begins with 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.940
 prayer 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.200
 many people do not go there 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.630
 their jobs because no one before 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.650
 prayed to you to say sir, I 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.590
 can 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.959
 You accept me in the last resort. 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.510
 really depend on it accepting and 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.380
 here comes another controversial opinion of 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.930
 my part 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.690
 many are not missionaries in their 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.510
 not even because they do not want to be 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.240
 because God does not want them 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.310
 and there we really have 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.050
 reasons to pray why did God 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.050
 You do not want me on the mission. 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.410
 if the order is to make if the statement is e 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.990
 why does not he does not strengthen me 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.720
 Because I know what's happening and 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.139
 I think there would be the reason 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.910
 really serious to think about because 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.340
 I'm not included in the one that's the best. 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.889
 because I am not a part because I 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.509
 I have no children in the faith because I do not 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.419
 I can teach someone to walk in 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:02.509
 the ways of the Lord and sometimes because I 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.979
 I can not teach my children either. 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.490
 there I think we really have 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.500
 reasons to snore at the man who is 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.240
 Happening to me, sir, I'm here. 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.240
 margin of your intentions sir
