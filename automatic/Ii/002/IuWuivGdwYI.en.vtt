 40 km of riverbanks have been developed which

 didier martinez hello you are loaded 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.100
 of the maintenance of this channel a channel that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.810
 today offers the turn of lyon a 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.660
 longer walks and it's true 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.700
 that it's 40 km massa connects the park of 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.530
 the feyssine gorse messerli also 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.830
 agglomeration and I believe that this 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.080
 project especially does not favor all 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.420
 the sweet words whether it's the bike the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.160
 scooter even the horse on a 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.770
 part a problem for the riders 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.690
 there we are in the on the promenade des 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.370
 rebels and we realize that there is a 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.960
 great place left to wildlife and the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.970
 flora fauna and flora what is it 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.850
 it's to show people that we are 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.980
 at the edge of town but we are on the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.940
 nature and that in limit of the city and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.350
 well there is wildlife 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.210
 there is flora which allows the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.340
 people to know there is a real 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.720
 pedagogical concern about this project 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.580
 development of the banks of the canal de 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.120
 Carry on 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.950
