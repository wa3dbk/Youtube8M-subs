the kind of commenting activity and

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.369 
the kind of commenting activity and

or five hours just playing through a bit
of<00:07:03.659> this<00:07:04.159> unless<00:07:05.159> the<00:07:05.369> servers<00:07:05.789> are<00:07:05.819> just

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:06.059

total<00:07:06.389> chaos<00:07:06.419> which<00:07:07.050> i'm<00:07:07.199> guessing<00:07:07.349> they<00:07:07.649> will

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
total chaos which i'm guessing they will

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.639 
total chaos which i'm guessing they will
be<00:07:08.039> by<00:07:08.369> the<00:07:08.399> time<00:07:08.550> i<00:07:08.819> log<00:07:09.029> on<00:07:09.179> tonight<00:07:09.649> because

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:10.649 
be by the time i log on tonight because

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.169

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:42.269 
and things like that because it's just

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:45.319
