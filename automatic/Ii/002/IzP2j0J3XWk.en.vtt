00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
basically just got to remember where

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.290 
basically just got to remember where
they<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.799> hopefully<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:37.010> figure<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.609> out

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
they go and hopefully I figure that out

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.050 
they go and hopefully I figure that out
we're<00:02:39.960> back<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.500> not<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> guess<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.700> got<00:02:41.880> did

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
we're back with not I guess I got did

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.010 
we're back with not I guess I got did
you<00:02:42.290> know<00:02:43.290> there's<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> take<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.060> bracket<00:02:45.690> off

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
you know there's a take this bracket off

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.620 
you know there's a take this bracket off
right<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.370> remove<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.600> two<00:02:50.630> these

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
right here and remove these two these

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.780 
right here and remove these two these
two<00:02:51.690> brackets<00:02:52.700> one<00:02:53.700> there<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.360> one<00:02:55.790> should

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
two brackets one there and one should

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.570 
two brackets one there and one should
allow<00:02:57.300> them<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.570> pick<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.500> top<00:02:58.800> big

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
allow them to pick up on that top big

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.430 
allow them to pick up on that top big
one<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.940> got<00:03:00.090> one<00:03:00.120> little<00:03:00.510> wire<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.050> hear<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.380> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
one we got one little wire I hear it's a
