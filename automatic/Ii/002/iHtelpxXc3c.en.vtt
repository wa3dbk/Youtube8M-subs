that's<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.120> capacity<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:30.599> power<00:03:31.599> bang

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
that's the capacity of this power bang

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.979 
that's the capacity of this power bang
and<00:03:32.049> then<00:03:32.349> input<00:03:33.160> output<00:03:33.640> all<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.090> stuff<00:03:34.330> we

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.569 
device and then you got the micro USB
port<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.000> charge<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.859> power<00:04:02.859> by<00:04:02.980> yourself<00:04:03.370> and

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
port to charge the power by yourself and

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.479 
port to charge the power by yourself and
then<00:04:03.819> for<00:04:04.180> LED<00:04:04.959> indicators<00:04:05.620> indicating<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
amount of charge inside the power bang

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.849 
amount of charge inside the power bang
and<00:04:09.700> then<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.910> button<00:04:10.239> itself<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.930> there<00:04:11.200> just

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
dilemma of charge inside the bed and

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.190 
dilemma of charge inside the bed and
power<00:04:17.260> bank<00:04:18.209> let's<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.359> quickly<00:04:19.570> compare<00:04:20.109> it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
power bank let's just quickly compare it

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.500 
power bank let's just quickly compare it
to<00:04:20.440> my<00:04:20.859> my<00:04:21.340> current<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.630> look<00:04:24.240> okay<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.360> can
