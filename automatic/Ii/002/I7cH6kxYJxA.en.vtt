00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 hello, friends, here I bring you one 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.350
 42- inch television is a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:45.780
 panasonic that there would be model tx p 42 x 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.650
 20 The failure of this TV is that the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.470
 tele after 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.210
 flashes 10 times and automatically 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.950
 turn off the possible failure that may have 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.890
 An LCD or CFC plasma television can 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.360
 be that the TV does not understand whose failures 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.980
 it is in the power supply 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.350
 the atv goes into standby mode problem 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.650
 possible in power supply in the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 plate inverted or virus or that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.260
 the tv turns on does not give an image but if it gives 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.450
 sound and it is possible the fault is going to be the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.080
 video plate the first thing that we should 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.930
 do in all the televisions is 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.430
 check all the plates 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 depending on the failure we have 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 review the components such as 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.130
 capacitors resistance transistors and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.560
 diodes as well as false welds or 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.560
 Broken tracks or games 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.930
 as we see the failure that presents me 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:59.300
 my television 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.710
 is that it blinks ten times and 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.090
 automatically it goes off 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.619
 the fault as I said before the plate 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.619
 video or mine board 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 now we see the main board 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.760
 here I brought another main board 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.689
 different 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.680
 and good we see the best one that I have removed 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:38.370
 that this is almost impossible 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.620
 and fix it brings component 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.989
 microcomponent better said smd and 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.019
 removing the odd condenser from 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.459
 the transistors and the circuits very 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:56.109
 difficult here we see how the two 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.959
 plates are identical voucher changes a bit 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:02.859
 the processor cooler plate 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:08.440
 but otherwise it has its two entrances 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:13.580
 of scart your network plug be 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.860
 your three keys hdmi the plug d 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.690
 network 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.290
 finally h 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.410
 the hm of the through the cards 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.280
 serial port everything there is no 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.070
 difference between a plate and another sounded 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.110
 the same and yet the advice you 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.570
 break your head because this plate 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.280
 second hand we can cost them 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.319
 about 60 80 euros and new ones because 850 and 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.959
 the truth that 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.200
 and repair them can not take many 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.200
 days 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.950
 as we see, I have already connected all your 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.560
 connectors that come from the sources of 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.980
 feed and invest here os 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.780
 I bring the other one to see the fault 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.480
 what I was bringing was that they had put a usb 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.970
 by the area of ​​the sd card 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.750
 then I had shorted in 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.610
 the main board and this is very difficult 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.410
 to fix it 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.220
 for that he has machinery 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.200
 professional and I do not have it in my case 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.910
 and everything that comes out of the investment 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.490
 and of the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.100
 power supply escapes me from 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.900
 hands 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.760
 and as we can see, the LED is left 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.900
 on and well let's turn on the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.860
 TV 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 so that makes us 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.969
 ding ding 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.379
 if not
