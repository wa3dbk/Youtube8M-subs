00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you lose some muscle you lose some most

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.290 
you lose some muscle you lose some most
of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> mass<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.950> loosen<00:00:38.280> cutting<00:00:38.579> would<00:00:39.180> be

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of the mass you loosen cutting would be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
of the mass you loosen cutting would be
water<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.410> fat<00:00:41.160> glycol<00:00:41.579> drian

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
water and you know fat glycol drian

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
water and you know fat glycol drian
things<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:43.379> lose<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.710> bit

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
things like that you lose a little bit

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
things like that you lose a little bit
of<00:00:43.920> muscle<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.940> back<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.510> your

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of muscle but when you get back on your

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.410 
of muscle but when you get back on your
bulky<00:00:46.200> plan<00:00:46.469> you'll<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.160> notice<00:00:47.460> gains

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
bulky plan you'll actually notice gains

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150 
bulky plan you'll actually notice gains
a<00:00:48.690> lot<00:00:48.989> quicker<00:00:49.289> than<00:00:49.469> someone<00:00:49.800> who<00:00:49.950> never

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a lot quicker than someone who never

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
a lot quicker than someone who never
actually<00:00:51.059> had<00:00:51.329> muscles<00:00:51.690> before<00:00:51.780> whenever<00:00:52.140> she

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
actually had muscles before whenever she

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.670 
actually had muscles before whenever she
worked<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:52.710> before<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.030> would<00:00:54.239> say<00:00:54.680> if

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
worked there before so I would say if

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.080 
worked there before so I would say if
you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.949> experience<00:00:56.430> working<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.910> used

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you have experience working out you used

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.279 
you have experience working out you used
to<00:00:57.210> work<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> trying<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:57.989> back<00:00:58.140> in

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
out and you know muscle memory pretty

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
out and you know muscle memory pretty
much<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.430> case<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.820> will<00:01:11.909> help<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> to

much so in that case it will help you to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.760 
much so in that case it will help you to
cut<00:01:12.540> first<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.080> book<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> never

you I would say try to put on muscle
first<00:01:24.030> put<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.960> muscle<00:01:25.170> first<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
first put on muscle first and go on the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
first put on muscle first and go on the
book<00:01:26.540> because<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> lot

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
cut and then put on muscle because

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
cut and then put on muscle because
people<00:01:31.920> complain<00:01:32.220> about<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.549> hard<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.909> to
