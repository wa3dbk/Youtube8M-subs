00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.600
 Describes the cells of an organism 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.600
 First of all 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.590
 When was the cells of an animal say you understand why cells of the plant 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 First, the cell wall of this plant 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:28.360
 I think there is a chloroplast and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.470
 Cell wall and 9th chloroplast 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.630
 Another that was from this that you can see that a plant 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.350
 It is the fourth station way 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.240
 You can tell that it is a plant also by this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.290
 Overwintering chloroplast 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.290
 Do photosynthesis 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.420
 23 or more turns and water 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.260
 Make starch and oxygen 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 And make energy 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:06.180
 And it is made of material that and the cells Station cellulose had been such a thing 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:14.009
 It is necessary to make the plant stand upright 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.250
 And because the station can not excrete plants because it can not go to the bathroom, excrement is in this station 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.390
 Keep it 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.780
 I think was a token of the art Kedomo I sometimes color is lucky for this station 4 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.780
 The color of the flower was determined by the pigment of this station 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:34.770
 Rather than in plant cells Well reverse what is the animal cell 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.540
 First one two 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.550
 Golgi body this protein 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.600
 There in order to discharge the protein made in the cell 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:54.420
 And one more like a fourth sun 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.420
 Use this when you pull up the chromosomes up and down when the center body to cell division 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.280
 later 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.460
 Most or Let's take a look in order 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.630
 1 th because both are common 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.810
 It is each 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.810
 so 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.150
 Animals or plants 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.200
 There are three major roles of cells 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.510
 The first thing is to make protein 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.450
 And the second one 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:35.959
 To say and make the energy 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:38.210
 The third one becomes other, but the most important thing in the cell is the role of the nail and one 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:45.350
 Making a protein 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:48.020
 Chromosome nucleoli in the mouth Toka or say is what exactly to say that this write 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.460
 These two are included 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.460
 In this chromosome 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:00.480
 blueprint to create a human protein called dna is written r 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.650
 Also I'd have written 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.650
 Each platoon in the same shell copies this dna 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.770
 so 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.770
 Copy result 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.170
 Copy that 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.599
 each 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.569
 A copy from here to the outside Kedomo cornea individual hole is open and I say that nuclear pore located around the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.890
 Extrude 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.890
 This copy 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:37.180
 After this it is a plate rake d 6 runaways have received this ribosome 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.380
 It is written now Kedomo of this No. 2 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.510
 Endoplasmic reticulum 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.210
 In what is referred to as 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.950
 Many are not clinging 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:53.660
 A copy of Deneae that came out of each 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:59.350
 Passed to the ribosome ribosome attached to this endoplasmic reticulum 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:02.350
 Ribosomes will continue to make a protein in its blueprint Street 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.790
 If you make protein with 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.519
 Passing to that this each endoplasmic reticulum 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.360
 Commercial law is a round parcel, isn't it? 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.100
 I wonder if I have to round parcels 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:24.210
 This is to make proteins final 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:26.950
 You have to put it out of the cell membrane and make it into a muscle, so it will be rolled up small . 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:34.300
 After in rounded small 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:38.780
 Is then further modified in the cell membrane through a convenient form is passed to the Golgi 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.740
 Cells outside the Golgi apparatus is secreted 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:47.350
 This is a cell 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:52.870
 The most important thing is what happens in the process of making protein 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:58.110
 And the second of the important role of the second cell is to make energy 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:01.770
 This third place is where the energy of jazz is made 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.770
 It is called mitochondria 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:13.639
 Among the three mitochondria there is a part called matrix 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.800
 Here to oxygen 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.220
 Starch 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:26.060
 It is a finely divided head 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:28.520
 We make energy and carbon dioxide using 3 stations and head 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:35.680
 This energy 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.680
 It is a movement in the cell or a movement of the whole body 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.670
 And 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.280
 This is the second 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:51.450
 The other work of the third cell 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.450
 I explained earlier 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.770
 Pull up chromosomes at cell division 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:08.060
 It is the center want and the other one No. 7 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:14.289
 Lysosome What does this do? Cells not only make things but come in 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.289
 Nutrition there is no objection to become a tissue fluid from I'm ne blood 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.860
 Though it is used in the vegetative cell 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.240
 I can not enter 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:30.110
 Garbage something like after it has been used is not it exits the things that such garbage like 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.190
 To this reverse 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.190
 It must be discharged 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.849
 Why not go to be divided finely is scattered at the time which is not to be pushed into the vein 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.480
 is 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:48.910
 It is this ideal general affairs to divide this house waste into small pieces 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:52.070
 b Runaway 6 The lysosome name is similar and the form is also similar 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:57.100
 Ribosome if not the tell in the form is 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.100
 Such Dharma type screw Affairs has a break 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:05.580
 Make the cells of the role protein by say 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:08.729
 And after I made energy, I got on that 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.770
 It means that there are three major roles 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:15.740
 Described by 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.740
 It is this eighth cell membrane which was not able to do it
