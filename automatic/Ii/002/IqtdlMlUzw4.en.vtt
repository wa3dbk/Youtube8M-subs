 before they take a picture 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 to purify the soul and achieve that the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.260
 resulting image is a memory of what 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.339
 ephemeral of the material but returning to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.870
 the expression of the duck's face 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.370

 but current entities of photographs to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.150
 over the years but what very 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.830
 few know is the meaning 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.510
 Original symbolic of the duck's face 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.160

 of the mid-fifteenth century when the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.730

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.500
 how this meant a bird is like 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.900

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.920
 shoots very useful when you have a lion 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.960
 hungry behind oneself a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.190
 partner with little common sense is like that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.050
 as unknowingly infinity of 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 young adolescents who reach the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.980

 curious is that unknowingly they continue 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.240
 emitting the original trigger signal 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.000
 no longer a weapon but the camera itself to 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.280
 that they take the photograph the face 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.260
 and a more resolute mystery thanks to the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.580
