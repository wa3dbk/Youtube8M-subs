00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
a governmental number I think the whole

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.640 
a governmental number I think the whole
setup<00:01:30.440> is<00:01:30.770> is<00:01:31.100> good<00:01:31.430> I<00:01:31.700> mean<00:01:32.660> we<00:01:32.810> use<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.320> like

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
setup is is good I mean we use the like

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
professionals as in as an entrance to so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.260 
professionals as in as an entrance to so
they<00:01:41.930> are<00:01:41.960> still<00:01:42.320> sort<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.160> white<00:01:43.400> spots<00:01:43.820> which

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
they are still sort of white spots which

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.780 
they are still sort of white spots which
we<00:01:44.450> have<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> address<00:01:45.190> but<00:01:46.190> it's<00:01:46.220> also<00:01:46.520> we

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
we have to address but it's also we

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.440 
we have to address but it's also we
never<00:01:47.660> thought<00:01:47.900> that<00:01:47.960> we<00:01:48.140> would<00:01:49.210> set<00:01:50.210> up<00:01:50.360> a

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
never thought that we would set up a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.940 
never thought that we would set up a
perfect<00:01:50.900> register<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.650> one<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.550> one<00:01:53.470> time<00:01:54.470> so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
perfect register in one in one time so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:03.120 
perfect register in one in one time so
that's<00:01:55.550> why<00:01:55.759> we<00:01:55.790> think<00:01:56.690> we<00:01:56.840> can<00:01:56.869> improve<00:01:57.259> it

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.779 

the<00:02:03.640> aim<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.479> register<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.890> person

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
the aim of the register is that a person

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.999 
the aim of the register is that a person
can<00:02:07.149> look<00:02:07.329> up<00:02:07.509> whether<00:02:07.780> his<00:02:08.080> doctor<00:02:08.560> has<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009
