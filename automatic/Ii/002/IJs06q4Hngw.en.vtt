00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 You

 It is a thing as I told in the previous video 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 I have purchased the iphone 6 plus I guess this is the best 6 plus 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.150
 I think that size is the size of the anxious, but variously look at the places of little concern 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.510
 I think 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.200
 Will become the best care if First I male 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.760
 Pockets are jeans 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.760
 Whether it can be in the pocket of the pants 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.480
 This is a really tight jeans 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.900
 Hey you 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.900
 Such feeling margin 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.240
 In the back pocket 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 I will not hide in the back pocket anymore I will not enter at all 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 There is nothing to see above 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.170
 Follow the shirt pocket 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.920
 It enters your 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.560
 It is sold for a while but it looks like this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.860
 I can not enter 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.840
 If it is this, it is already this 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.420
 Kane have a photographer with a camera 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.800
 I feel so good in the camera part I say in shooting while walking I wonder this is 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.540
 Hmmm 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.200
 What's the rest of the time I'm calling while I'm on the phone I'm so big 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.910
 Will be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.340
 It feels like there's no such thing as another 4 fun I hear from ipad 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.480
 It's all small 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.140
 Hey, it looks like a white phone 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.950
 Put on the ear 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.000
 I think labor is not normal 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 It feels like this when I'm calling you so cool 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.229
 The 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.740
 Comparison of it yes not a of 10,000 yen bill I wonder if it is indeed the after 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.740
 6 plus Hey Nde was that it's almost the same as the 10,000 yen bill 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.030
 Embarrassing defeat as adults also fell 1 Background 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.090
 It is 5000 yen bill institutional Mr. Kana prima facie 5000 yen like this 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.480
 Is together at 5000 yen or together with a 5000 yen bill 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 It will pale in most little ne monetary 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.950
 Together with contamination deviation 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.900
 After that it is the sound comparison with the iphone 5s, but the sane of the display area 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.850
 Such a feeling is completely different with a memo 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.940
 Item is displayed with iphone 5s and 11 items 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.280
 If it is 6 plus, it is 15 items 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:40.069
 The item is displayed, it is a note 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.370
