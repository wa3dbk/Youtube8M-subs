even<00:04:07.830> though<00:04:08.010> they<00:04:08.100> may<00:04:08.280> be<00:04:08.310> modded<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.940> maybe

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
even though they may be modded and maybe

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.210 
even though they may be modded and maybe
maybe<00:04:09.570> Gibbs<00:04:09.930> they're<00:04:10.320> still<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:11.130> won't

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
maybe Gibbs they're still they won't

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.440

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
disappear in the bank right then because

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.810 
disappear in the bank right then because
they<00:04:12.660> are<00:04:12.780> real<00:04:13.019> guns<00:04:13.200> technical<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.950> probably

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
they are real guns technical I probably

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.949 
they are real guns technical I probably
won't<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.090> getting<00:04:15.180> rid<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.420> these<00:04:15.480> because

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.130 
we're gonna have a lot of fun with this
guy<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.860> really<00:05:40.980> recommend<00:05:41.160> picking<00:05:41.610> it<00:05:41.820> up

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
guy and I really recommend picking it up

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.450 
guy and I really recommend picking it up
if<00:05:43.140> you<00:05:43.230> get<00:05:43.380> redundant<00:05:43.860> as<00:05:43.980> an<00:05:44.100> added<00:05:44.310> bonus

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
if you get redundant as an added bonus

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.430 
if you get redundant as an added bonus
if<00:05:44.880> you<00:05:44.910> get<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.210> win-win<00:05:45.930> I<00:05:45.960> believe<00:05:46.260> that's

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
if you get a win-win I believe that's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.870 
if you get a win-win I believe that's
fire<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> bonus<00:05:47.100> but<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.340> fire<00:05:47.520> rates<00:05:47.670> would<00:05:47.790> be

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
fire a bonus but the fire rates would be

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.280 
fire a bonus but the fire rates would be
amazing<00:05:48.450> on<00:05:48.540> this<00:05:48.660> gun<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.020> you<00:05:49.080> don't<00:05:49.200> really

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
amazing on this gun so you don't really

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.650 
amazing on this gun so you don't really
need<00:05:49.500> it

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
need it

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.780 
need it
dynamic<00:05:51.740> camera<00:05:52.740> with<00:05:52.860> die<00:05:52.980> I<00:05:53.160> know<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.490> good

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
dynamic camera with die I know a good

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.780 
dynamic camera with die I know a good
amount<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.120> prefixes<00:05:54.630> but<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.610> think<00:05:56.610> I

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
amount of the prefixes but I I think I

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.400 
amount of the prefixes but I I think I
peirong<00:05:57.060> pistols<00:05:57.390> have<00:05:57.480> a<00:05:57.570> ton<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:57.840> prefixes

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
peirong pistols have a ton of prefixes

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.740 
peirong pistols have a ton of prefixes
though<00:05:58.590> so<00:05:58.830> never<00:05:59.160> never<00:05:59.220> mind<00:05:59.670> on<00:05:59.820> that<00:05:59.970> hey

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
though so never never mind on that hey

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.600 
though so never never mind on that hey

is like which is a like TK's wave from
the<00:06:24.060> first<00:06:24.240> game<00:06:24.420> and<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:24.660> first<00:06:24.780> game<00:06:24.960> was

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
the first game and the first game was

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.690 
the first game and the first game was
much<00:06:25.260> better<00:06:25.530> in<00:06:25.710> this<00:06:26.190> game<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.490> kind<00:06:26.640> of

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
much better in this game it kind of

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.970 
much better in this game it kind of
sucks<00:06:27.120> as<00:06:27.390> I've<00:06:27.960> used<00:06:28.200> and<00:06:28.380> I<00:06:28.470> used<00:06:28.650> it<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:28.890> I

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
sucks as I've used and I used it and I

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.460 
sucks as I've used and I used it and I
used<00:06:29.640> it<00:06:29.790> in<00:06:29.910> normal<00:06:30.150> mode<00:06:30.480> and<00:06:30.690> it<00:06:30.780> sucks<00:06:31.110> so

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
used it in normal mode and it sucks so

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.620 
used it in normal mode and it sucks so
you<00:06:32.070> know<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.400> made<00:06:32.790> look<00:06:33.060> into<00:06:33.300> that<00:06:33.390> a<00:06:33.450> little

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
you know I made look into that a little

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.469 
you know I made look into that a little
more<00:06:33.780> see<00:06:34.229> if<00:06:34.260> that's<00:06:35.070> right<00:06:35.370> but<00:06:35.669> I<00:06:35.700> really

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
more see if that's right but I really

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.580 
more see if that's right but I really
would<00:06:36.630> recommend<00:06:36.750> getting<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:37.260> Ladyfest

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
would recommend getting the Ladyfest

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.399 
would recommend getting the Ladyfest

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
instead of the tide

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:43.469 
instead of the tide
wave<00:06:38.529> by<00:06:39.429> the<00:06:39.489> wave<00:06:39.639> is<00:06:39.909> just<00:06:40.599> don't<00:06:41.199> don't<00:06:42.479> go

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 
wave by the wave is just don't don't go

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.269 
wave by the wave is just don't don't go
for<00:06:43.719> this<00:06:43.809> go<00:06:44.110> for<00:06:44.259> the<00:06:44.319> lady<00:06:44.469> fist<00:06:44.739> is<00:06:44.919> crazy
