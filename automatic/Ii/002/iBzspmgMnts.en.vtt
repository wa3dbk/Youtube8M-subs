00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.359
 today we 'll talk about rosemary not 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.880
 we all know that in warm lands 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.750
 even our country rosemary grows 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.939
 nature as a normal plant 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.300

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.710
 private sites we have the same rosemary 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.110
 winter only in those places where it can be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.290
 either covered or the place is not lee 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.059
 in a cold leeward place rosemary 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.020
 was feeling very bad and from 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.420
 an abomination almost to the root in principle 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 principle it can be contained in the house 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.910
 if you spray it and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.280
