00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
easy to make all you need is a block of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
easy to make all you need is a block of
your<00:00:13.049> choosing<00:00:13.490> iron<00:00:14.490> bars<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.269> water<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> I'm

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
your choosing iron bars and water so I'm

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.550 
your choosing iron bars and water so I'm
just<00:00:18.029> show<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.170> see

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
just show you this first as you can see

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.470 
just show you this first as you can see
you<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:20.699> your<00:00:20.970> pool<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> water<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:23.480> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you have your pool of water here and it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.359 
you have your pool of water here and it
goes<00:00:24.539> through<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.109> bars<00:00:25.320> technically<00:00:26.189> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
goes through the bars technically it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.400 
goes through the bars technically it
doesn't<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> iron<00:00:27.630> bar<00:00:27.869> separates

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
doesn't because the iron bar separates

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.880 
doesn't because the iron bar separates
it<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.859> no<00:00:29.070> water<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:30.140> assume<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.170> space

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it and no water can assume that space

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
it and no water can assume that space
but<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.260> sort<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:36.590> visual

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but it's all you know sort of visual

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
but it's all you know sort of visual
trick<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> were<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
trick as it were so there you go you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
trick as it were so there you go you
have<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> water<00:00:40.530> stain<00:00:40.920> standing<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
have the water stain standing there and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.959 
have the water stain standing there and
it<00:00:42.120> sort<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> flows<00:00:42.629> out<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.079> end<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it sort of flows out this end now you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
it sort of flows out this end now you
can<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> moving<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.410> looks<00:00:46.590> like

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
can also have it moving so it looks like

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.010 
can also have it moving so it looks like
the<00:00:46.770> waters<00:00:46.860> shifting<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.610> there

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
the waters shifting through there

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.510 
the waters shifting through there
easiest<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> fill<00:00:50.340> this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
easiest way to do that is to fill this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.779 
easiest way to do that is to fill this
in<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> go<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> water's<00:00:53.579> moving

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
in and there you go the water's moving

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
in and there you go the water's moving
so<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> show<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> how<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:56.070> dead

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so to show you how to do this it's dead

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.200 
so to show you how to do this it's dead
easy<00:00:56.780> just<00:00:57.780> dig<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> trench<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.969> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> other

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
easy just dig a trench and on the other

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149 
easy just dig a trench and on the other
side<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> even<00:01:04.589> once<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> water

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
side that's if you even once the water

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.640 
side that's if you even once the water
showing<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.210> think<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.900> worth<00:01:07.080> doing

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.570 

then<00:01:10.650> you'll<00:01:10.799> stick<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.130> iron<00:01:11.340> bar<00:01:11.580> there

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
then you'll stick your iron bar there

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.399 
then you'll stick your iron bar there
fill<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.939> water<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.900> one

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
fill that with water and use that one

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
fill that with water and use that one
water<00:01:16.650> block<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.150> flows<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
water block there and it flows so it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
water block there and it flows so it
looks<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.380> coming<00:01:19.500> through<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> iron

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
looks like it's coming through the iron

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.780 
looks like it's coming through the iron
bars<00:01:21.500> now<00:01:22.500> again<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> want<00:01:23.070> water<00:01:23.340> flowing

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
bars now again if you want water flowing

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
bars now again if you want water flowing
just<00:01:24.090> fill<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.570> remove<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
just fill it and remove it and there you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.109 
just fill it and remove it and there you
go<00:01:26.930> now<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.380> cool<00:01:29.189> thing<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
go now the other cool thing with this is

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
go now the other cool thing with this is
if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:30.930> home<00:01:31.200> high<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.650> somewhere

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
if you have your home high up somewhere

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200 
if you have your home high up somewhere
and<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> waters<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> sort<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.530> vacate

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
and you want waters to sort of vacate

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
and you want waters to sort of vacate
the<00:01:36.210> side<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.659> house<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.290> wherever<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.740> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the side of your house or wherever it is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
the side of your house or wherever it is
or<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.400> sewer<00:01:38.670> anywhere<00:01:39.299> like

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
or it could be a sewer anywhere like

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.230 
or it could be a sewer anywhere like
that<00:01:39.590> iron<00:01:40.590> bars<00:01:41.040> worked<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.670> well<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that iron bars worked really well like

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
that iron bars worked really well like
even<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:42.990> rough<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> floor<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:43.770> look

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
even when rough the floor they look

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
even when rough the floor they look
pretty<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.579> especially<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.720> up

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pretty good so especially when it's up

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
pretty good so especially when it's up
in<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.930> sky<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.250> quite

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
in the sky there you can see it quite

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
in the sky there you can see it quite
clearly<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> definitely<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
clearly and it definitely looks like the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.630 
clearly and it definitely looks like the
water's<00:01:49.979> coming<00:01:50.250> through<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> bars<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> again

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
water's coming through the bars so again

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
water's coming through the bars so again
that<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> same<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.920> just

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that was the same as down there you just

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
that was the same as down there you just
add<00:01:56.280> iron<00:01:56.579> bars<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.210> sort<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.659> area<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
add iron bars and sort of area for the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.550 
add iron bars and sort of area for the
water<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.560> come<00:01:59.009> from<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.439> it
