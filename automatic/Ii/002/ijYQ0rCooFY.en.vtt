00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
in the phone do the steps that we're

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.830 
in the phone do the steps that we're
doing<00:02:10.800> now<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> erase<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.090> phone

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
doing now to erase the phone

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.290 
doing now to erase the phone
and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.080> once<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.470> powers<00:02:13.830> back<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.819> take

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and then once it powers back on take

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.869 
and then once it powers back on take
your<00:02:15.510> SIM<00:02:15.750> card<00:02:16.050> out<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.220> reason<00:02:17.580> why<00:02:17.730> we

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
your SIM card out and the reason why we

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.180 
your SIM card out and the reason why we
do<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:19.230> some<00:02:19.680> phones<00:02:19.920> save

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
do that is because some phones save

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.640 
do that is because some phones save
information<00:02:20.489> directly<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> phone<00:02:21.750> some

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
information directly on the phone some

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.380 
information directly on the phone some
phones<00:02:22.890> save<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> information<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> SIM

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
phones save the information on the SIM

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.809 
phones save the information on the SIM
card<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> best<00:02:25.560> thing<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> just

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819
