you<00:00:05.370> know<00:00:05.490> one<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.910> things<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.330> fishing<00:00:06.720> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
you know one of the things in fishing is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.759 
you know one of the things in fishing is
is<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.859> theory<00:00:08.460> called<00:00:08.700> just<00:00:09.480> fish<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.170> all<00:00:10.320> you

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
is a theory called just fish at all you

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.810 
is a theory called just fish at all you
know<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.040> that's<00:00:11.099> what<00:00:11.280> we're<00:00:11.429> trying<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.700> do

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
know and that's what we're trying to do

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.940 
know and that's what we're trying to do
here<00:00:11.849> we<00:00:12.840> start<00:00:13.139> rolling<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.440> open<00:00:13.799> water

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
here we start rolling that open water

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.779 
here we start rolling that open water
flat<00:00:14.509> fish<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> bunch<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.020> crank<00:00:16.289> baits<00:00:16.789> no

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
flat fish to a bunch of crank baits no

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.529 
flat fish to a bunch of crank baits no
bites<00:00:18.090> no<00:00:18.330> grass<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.119> kind<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> made<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bites no grass so we just kind of made a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.050 
bites no grass so we just kind of made a
move<00:00:21.840> over<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.470> corner<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.100> there's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
move over to this corner and there's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.470 
move over to this corner and there's
there's<00:00:24.390> marina<00:00:24.779> docks<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
there's marina docks you know and so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.759 
there's marina docks you know and so
when<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:27.630> practicing<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.619> that

you know a lot of times docks are real
good<00:00:40.290> areas<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> year<00:00:41.399> when

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
good areas it's time of the year when

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.090 
good areas it's time of the year when
during<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.390> funny<00:00:42.719> transition<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:44.070> know

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
during in that funny transition you know

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760 
during in that funny transition you know
docks<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.120> ladders<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:46.620> they're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
docks are like ladders so when they're

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
docks are like ladders so when they're
coming<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> deep<00:00:47.640> water<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.270> their

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
coming out of the deep water and their

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
coming out of the deep water and their
head<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.050> shallow<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.460> times<00:00:50.670> these

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
head and shallow a lot of times these

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
head and shallow a lot of times these
docks<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.270> act<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.539> ladders<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.230> they'll

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
docks will act like ladders and they'll

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
docks will act like ladders and they'll
follow<00:00:52.860> these<00:00:53.219> ladders<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> spawning

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
follow these ladders up to the spawning

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.410 
follow these ladders up to the spawning
area<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.520> kind<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.030> gonna<00:00:57.210> run

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
area so we just kind of are gonna run

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.099 
area so we just kind of are gonna run
through<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.719> docks<00:00:58.020> real<00:00:58.350> quick<00:01:00.109> switch

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
through these docks real quick switch

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
through these docks real quick switch
from<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> crank<00:01:01.710> bait<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.850> actually

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
from the crank bait I'm actually

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
from the crank bait I'm actually
pitching<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.719> I'm<00:01:03.899> pitching<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.320> brand<00:01:04.890> new
