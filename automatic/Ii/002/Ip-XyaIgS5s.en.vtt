Thompson for his discussions first off
we<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.010> Brio<00:00:08.730> diesel<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:11.280> let's<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.700> say

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
we have Brio diesel so let's just say

side of him just two screws holding
together<00:00:57.469> not<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.500> much<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> say<00:00:58.980> about

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
together not really much to say about

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.789 
together not really much to say about
diesel<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.030> completely<00:01:00.989> honest<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:03.799> one

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
diesel to be completely honest and one

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.410 
diesel to be completely honest and one
thing<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> say<00:01:05.280> about<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.640> model<00:01:06.030> though<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
thing to say about my model though is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.920 
thing to say about my model though is
his<00:01:07.290> front<00:01:07.560> magnet<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> looks<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> little

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
his front magnet it looks a little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
his front magnet it looks a little
different<00:01:10.110> than<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.159> magnet<00:01:11.750> real

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
different than the is back magnet real

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.440 
different than the is back magnet real
magnet<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.610> well<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.090> theories

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
magnet because well I have two theories

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.070 
magnet because well I have two theories
of<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:15.990> might<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> happened<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
of what might have happened you see and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.740 
of what might have happened you see and
on<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.950> real<00:01:20.430> magnet<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.030> see<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
on these real magnet you see as this is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.910 
on these real magnet you see as this is
for<00:01:22.610> circle<00:01:23.610> thing<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.409> know<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.740> very

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
for circle thing I know it's not very

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
for circle thing I know it's not very
good<00:01:26.009> quality<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.430> still<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.960> all

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
good quality but still as this is all

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.560 
good quality but still as this is all
circular<00:01:28.890> thing<00:01:29.070> thrown<00:01:29.610> his<00:01:29.790> magnet<00:01:30.180> rig

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
circular thing thrown his magnet rig

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
circular thing thrown his magnet rig
doesn't<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.320> his<00:01:31.860> front<00:01:32.430> magnet<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> for

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
doesn't on this his front magnet so for

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
doesn't on this his front magnet so for
a<00:01:35.130> longest<00:01:35.460> time<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> thought<00:01:35.909> maybe<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.600> dad

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
a longest time I thought maybe you dad

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.929 
a longest time I thought maybe you dad
had<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:36.960> come<00:01:37.229> off<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.369> looking<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
had just come off but now looking at it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
had just come off but now looking at it
I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.689> his<00:01:39.930> whole<00:01:40.170> magnet<00:01:40.770> might<00:01:40.979> have

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I think that his whole magnet might have

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.910 
I think that his whole magnet might have
come<00:01:41.250> off<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:41.729> point<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.770> put

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
come off at some point and I just put

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410 
come off at some point and I just put
like<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.040> drawing<00:01:44.369> pin<00:01:44.729> or<00:01:44.850> something<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> there

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like a drawing pin or something in there

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.800 
like a drawing pin or something in there
and<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:47.189> reason<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> say<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> because<00:01:48.180> if

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and the reason I say that is because if

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.639 
and the reason I say that is because if
I<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> truck<00:01:49.979> around<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:51.380> I'll<00:01:52.380> choose

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
I have a truck around you I'll choose

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.550 
I have a truck around you I'll choose
this<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:53.720> he's<00:01:54.720> meant<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.079> couple<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.409> I'll

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
this one he's meant a couple up I'll

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
this one he's meant a couple up I'll
show<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.860> he's<00:01:56.549> meant<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> cover<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
show you he's meant to cover to the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.190 
show you he's meant to cover to the
truck<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.119> naturally<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:00.780> couples

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
truck like this so naturally he couples

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.440 
truck like this so naturally he couples
up<00:02:01.320> perfectly<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.299> was<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
up perfectly like that but if I was to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.050 
up perfectly like that but if I was to
turn<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> truck<00:02:04.140> around

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
turn the truck around

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.730 
turn the truck around
he<00:02:06.060> still<00:02:06.329> couples<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.049> pretty<00:02:07.170> well

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
he still couples up to it pretty well

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.720 
he still couples up to it pretty well
you<00:02:09.220> see<00:02:09.580> he<00:02:09.760> doesn't<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.150> way<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.730> that's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
you see he doesn't that way so that's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.920 
you see he doesn't that way so that's
