00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.610 
ok lesson 3 I want to dig into a concept

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.999 
ok lesson 3 I want to dig into a concept
known<00:00:03.909> as<00:00:03.969> intervals<00:00:04.839> and<00:00:05.109> talking<00:00:05.799> about

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.009 
known as intervals and talking about

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.070 
known as intervals and talking about
playing<00:00:06.339> intervals<00:00:06.939> when<00:00:07.810> we're<00:00:07.930> talking

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
playing intervals when we're talking

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.510 
playing intervals when we're talking
about<00:00:08.290> intervals<00:00:08.950> we're<00:00:09.100> talking<00:00:09.340> about

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.520 
about intervals we're talking about

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.580 
about intervals we're talking about
basically<00:00:09.850> two<00:00:10.180> notes<00:00:10.480> two<00:00:11.020> different<00:00:11.410> notes

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
basically two notes two different notes

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.970 
basically two notes two different notes
I'm<00:00:12.130> going<00:00:12.370> to<00:00:12.520> use<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:12.880> key<00:00:13.060> of<00:00:13.180> C<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:14.230> explain

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
I'm going to use the key of C to explain

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.730 
I'm going to use the key of C to explain
some<00:00:15.280> of<00:00:15.310> this<00:00:15.520> and<00:00:15.760> basically<00:00:16.630> I<00:00:17.169> want<00:00:17.500> you<00:00:17.619> to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
some of this and basically I want you to

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.700 
some of this and basically I want you to
keep<00:00:17.890> in<00:00:18.070> mind<00:00:18.369> that<00:00:18.839> when<00:00:19.839> we<00:00:20.050> are<00:00:20.499> to

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
keep in mind that when we are to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.370 
keep in mind that when we are to
thinking<00:00:21.039> about<00:00:21.160> notes<00:00:22.029> and<00:00:22.359> scale<00:00:22.749> steps<00:00:23.140> and

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
thinking about notes and scale steps and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.630 
thinking about notes and scale steps and
intervals<00:00:23.800> we're<00:00:24.579> talking<00:00:24.970> about<00:00:25.060> a<00:00:26.159> scale<00:00:27.159> in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
intervals we're talking about a scale in

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.729 
intervals we're talking about a scale in
a<00:00:27.759> sense<00:00:28.060> and<00:00:28.480> we're<00:00:28.630> talking<00:00:28.779> about<00:00:28.990> numbers

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
a sense and we're talking about numbers

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.370 
a sense and we're talking about numbers
and<00:00:29.949> so<00:00:30.489> if<00:00:30.669> we<00:00:30.820> start<00:00:30.970> on<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.419> notes<00:00:31.810> seen<00:00:32.169> we

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
and so if we start on the notes seen we

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.850 
and so if we start on the notes seen we
call<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.650> our<00:00:32.830> one<00:00:33.280> then<00:00:34.000> d<00:00:34.330> is<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.780> use<00:00:35.380> three

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
call that our one then d is to use three

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.430 
call that our one then d is to use three
enough<00:00:36.490> is<00:00:36.810> 4g<00:00:37.810> is<00:00:37.960> 5a<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:39.600> 6b<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.630> seven<00:00:41.290> and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
enough is 4g is 5a is 6b is seven and

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.750 
enough is 4g is 5a is 6b is seven and
our<00:00:42.070> octave<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.700> see<00:00:43.000> ok<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:44.620> now<00:00:44.800> I<00:00:45.100> want<00:00:45.670> to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
our octave is see ok so now I want to

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.680 
our octave is see ok so now I want to
talk<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.060> you<00:00:46.120> about<00:00:46.210> very<00:00:46.540> specific

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
talk to you about very specific

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.380 
talk to you about very specific
intervals<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.650> are<00:00:47.710> common<00:00:48.250> in<00:00:48.370> music<00:00:48.760> the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
interval of a third of fifth a sixth and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.700 
interval of a third of fifth a sixth and
an<00:00:53.140> octave<00:00:53.590> right<00:00:54.280> based<00:00:54.970> on<00:00:55.240> a/c<00:00:55.750> starting

interval would be fifths all right a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.420 
interval would be fifths all right a
fifth<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:15.930> we're<00:02:16.799> talking<00:02:16.950> about<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.220> power

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
fifth and we're talking about a power

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.539 
fifth and we're talking about a power
cord<00:02:17.820> basically<00:02:18.359> right<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.070> play<00:02:20.340> from

okay certainly you understand what
fifths<00:02:32.530> our<00:02:32.650> power<00:02:32.890> cords<00:02:33.280> are<00:02:33.400> fifths<00:02:33.760> all

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
fifths our power cords are fifths all

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.910 
fifths our power cords are fifths all
right<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.780> can<00:02:34.959> actually<00:02:35.080> play<00:02:35.500> Finn's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
right and we can actually play Finn's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.399 
right and we can actually play Finn's
all<00:02:36.310> over<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.730> front<00:02:37.060> board<00:02:37.299> they<00:02:38.110> change

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
all over the front board they change

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.640 
all over the front board they change
fingering<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.129> here<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.549> top<00:02:39.580> couple<00:02:40.030> of

the change fingering up on the top marks

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.960 
the change fingering up on the top marks
like<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:50.129> fifths<00:02:51.129> are<00:02:51.250> abused<00:02:51.610> more

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
like that fifths are abused more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.509 
like that fifths are abused more
commonly<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.660> rhythm<00:02:52.870> sense<00:02:53.290> thirds<00:02:54.220> you

commonly in a rhythm sense thirds you

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.240 
commonly in a rhythm sense thirds you
can<00:02:54.700> use<00:02:54.819> in<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.060> lead<00:02:55.239> sense<00:02:55.540> right<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.920> next

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
can use in a lead sense right the next

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.160 
can use in a lead sense right the next
