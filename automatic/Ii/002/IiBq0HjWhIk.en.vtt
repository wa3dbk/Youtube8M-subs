hi I'm Adam cap and today we're learning

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.470 
hi I'm Adam cap and today we're learning
about<00:00:04.440> how<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.799> make<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> battery<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.700> this<00:00:06.180> clip

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
about how to make a battery in this clip

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.670 
about how to make a battery in this clip
we're<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.049> take<00:00:07.259> an<00:00:07.410> ordinary

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
we're going to take an ordinary

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.650 
we're going to take an ordinary
household<00:00:08.280> potato<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.030> turned<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.389> into<00:00:09.540> a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
household potato and turned it into a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.690 
household potato and turned it into a
voltage<00:00:10.050> source<00:00:10.230> powerful<00:00:10.889> enough<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.490> drive

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
voltage source powerful enough to drive

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.360 
voltage source powerful enough to drive
an<00:00:11.849> LED<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.990> start<00:00:13.259> off<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.950> need<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> get<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
an LED to start off you need to get a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
an LED to start off you need to get a
regular<00:00:14.849> household<00:00:15.299> potato<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.020> cut<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
regular household potato and cut it in

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
regular household potato and cut it in
half<00:00:16.580> because<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.730> household<00:00:18.090> potato<00:00:18.390> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
half because of household potato is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.210 
half because of household potato is
relatively<00:00:19.020> large<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.590> don't<00:00:19.740> need<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> whole

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
relatively large we don't need the whole

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
relatively large we don't need the whole
thing<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.119> use<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.779> halves<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
thing and we can use the two halves to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560 
thing and we can use the two halves to
make<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.650> voltage<00:00:23.039> sources<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.449> go

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
make two voltage sources so if you go

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.810 
make two voltage sources so if you go
ahead<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> cut<00:00:25.170> your<00:00:25.260> potato<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.800> half<00:00:25.980> you'll

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
ahead and cut your potato in half you'll

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.099 
ahead and cut your potato in half you'll
start<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.150> notice<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.570> they're<00:00:27.779> relatively

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
start to notice that they're relatively

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320 
start to notice that they're relatively
juicy<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.400> don't<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.760> potatoes<00:00:30.179> are

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
juicy and I don't think potatoes are

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.970 
juicy and I don't think potatoes are
known<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.689> their<00:00:30.810> juices<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.769> that's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
known for their juices but that's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
known for their juices but that's
exactly<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.270> act<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
exactly what is going to act as the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
exactly what is going to act as the
electrolyte<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.710> need<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> order<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> produce

of the potato at this point it's very

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
of the potato at this point it's very
important<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.439> cathode<00:01:34.950> doesn't<00:01:35.610> touch

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
important that the cathode doesn't touch

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.640 
important that the cathode doesn't touch
the<00:01:35.970> anode<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.960> two<00:01:37.140> touch<00:01:37.409> together

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the anode if the two touch together

and<00:05:51.120> if<00:05:52.020> we<00:05:52.170> recall<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.740> first<00:05:52.980> clip<00:05:53.340> I've

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
and if we recall the first clip I've

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.000 
and if we recall the first clip I've
outlined<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.720> connecting<00:05:55.470> batteries<00:05:55.860> in

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
outlined that connecting batteries in

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.530 
outlined that connecting batteries in
parallel<00:05:56.190> doesn't<00:05:56.880> increase<00:05:57.150> their<00:05:57.360> voltage

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
parallel doesn't increase their voltage

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.660 
parallel doesn't increase their voltage
it<00:05:57.930> increases<00:05:58.380> their<00:05:58.560> current<00:05:58.950> so<00:05:59.460> by

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
it increases their current so by

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.670 
it increases their current so by
connecting<00:06:00.330> three<00:06:00.660> pairs<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:01.170> parallel

going to increase their voltage and
increase<00:06:06.060> their<00:06:06.240> current<00:06:10.340> now<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.490> we<00:06:11.580> have

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
increase their current now that we have

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.340 
increase their current now that we have
three<00:06:11.940> pairs<00:06:12.210> of<00:06:12.300> batteries<00:06:12.750> connected<00:06:13.230> in
