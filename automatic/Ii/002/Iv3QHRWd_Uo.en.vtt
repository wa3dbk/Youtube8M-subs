into something smaller than what it

into something smaller than what it
currently<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> taking<00:00:52.559> place<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
currently is will be taking place and we

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.619 
currently is will be taking place and we
already<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> little<00:00:53.789> tip<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.149> yesterday

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
already see that little tip do yesterday

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.380 
already see that little tip do yesterday
and<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.920> spread<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.820> far<00:00:57.120> like

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.880 
and it's not as spread out this far like
we<00:00:57.570> had<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.559> bit<00:00:58.680> smaller

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
we had it it's now a little bit smaller

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
we had it it's now a little bit smaller
but<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.309> very<00:00:59.340> elongated<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.420> centers<00:01:00.809> one

going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:16.049> uncertain<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.250> is

going to be uncertain and what we see is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.539 
going to be uncertain and what we see is
the<00:01:17.670> model<00:01:18.270> tracks<00:01:18.650> have<00:01:19.650> shifted<00:01:20.189> since

Hurricane Center and what they're saying
and<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:09.179> why<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.720> only<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.379> far<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and that's why they only go so far as to

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.170 
and that's why they only go so far as to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
when it comes to that now if we look at

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.400 
when it comes to that now if we look at
the<00:02:25.950> system<00:02:26.100> today<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:27.630> do<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:27.960> convection

the system today we do see convection
going<00:02:28.680> off<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> starting<00:02:29.610> to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
going off and we see it starting to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.250 
going off and we see it starting to
consolidate<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.900> talked<00:02:31.110> about

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
consolidate like we talked about

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.110 
consolidate like we talked about
yesterday<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.250> northern<00:02:32.730> part<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
yesterday because this northern part is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.670 
yesterday because this northern part is
coming<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> west<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.320> starting<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
coming to the west and it's starting to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.190 
coming to the west and it's starting to
support<00:02:35.580> what<00:02:36.060> was<00:02:36.210> already<00:02:36.600> here<00:02:36.810> yesterday

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
support what was already here yesterday

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
support what was already here yesterday
the<00:02:37.500> official<00:02:38.070> center<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.150> will<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the official center if you will of the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840 
the official center if you will of the
disturbance<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.410> said<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.770> right<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.070> but

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
disturbance is said to be right here but

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.390 
disturbance is said to be right here but
this<00:02:42.090> vorticity<00:02:42.750> maximum<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> north<00:02:43.800> this

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this vorticity maximum to the north this

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.130 
this vorticity maximum to the north this
is<00:02:44.550> something<00:02:44.820> we<00:02:44.940> see<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> lot<00:02:45.420> where<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:45.990> get

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
is something we see a lot where they get

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.350 
is something we see a lot where they get
elongated<00:02:46.470> Southwest<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.610> Northeast<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.210> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
elongated Southwest to Northeast and the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.660 
elongated Southwest to Northeast and the
northern<00:02:48.870> vorticity<00:02:49.440> maximum<00:02:50.040> usually<00:02:50.490> ends

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
northern vorticity maximum usually ends

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.730 
northern vorticity maximum usually ends
up<00:02:50.730> winning<00:02:50.910> because<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.260> rubbing<00:02:52.620> up

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
up winning because it's rubbing up

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.680 
up winning because it's rubbing up
against<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> trade<00:02:53.460> winds<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.940> its<00:02:54.060> north<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
against the trade winds to its north and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.220 
against the trade winds to its north and
that<00:02:54.960> acts<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:56.040> focus<00:02:56.850> convergence<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that acts to focus convergence and you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.470 
that acts to focus convergence and you
so<00:02:58.440> usually<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.920> northern<00:02:59.340> side<00:02:59.640> wins<00:03:00.090> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
so usually the northern side wins and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.970 
so usually the northern side wins and
right<00:03:00.750> now<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.960> models<00:03:01.320> are<00:03:01.410> fighting<00:03:01.860> over

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
right now the models are fighting over

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.850 
right now the models are fighting over
which<00:03:02.520> part<00:03:03.270> of<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.570> storm<00:03:03.960> becomes<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
which part of this storm becomes the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.700 
which part of this storm becomes the
primary<00:03:05.780> source<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.960> convergence<00:03:07.560> and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
primary source of convergence and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.380 
primary source of convergence and
becomes<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.160> dominant<00:03:08.430> center<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
becomes the dominant center and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.240 
becomes the dominant center and
eventually<00:03:09.510> perhaps<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.320> center<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.860> storm

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
eventually perhaps the center of a storm

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.150 
eventually perhaps the center of a storm
over<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:12.000> next<00:03:12.300> few<00:03:12.450> days<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> models<00:03:14.070> are

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
over the next few days so the models are

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.560 
over the next few days so the models are
changing<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.640> until<00:03:14.880> they<00:03:14.970> can<00:03:15.120> latch<00:03:15.270> on<00:03:15.480> to

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
changing it until they can latch on to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.300 
changing it until they can latch on to
exactly<00:03:15.960> where<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.290> goes<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> short

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
exactly where this goes in the short

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.850 
exactly where this goes in the short
term<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:18.360> long<00:03:18.390> term<00:03:18.810> track<00:03:19.170> will<00:03:19.410> also<00:03:19.740> be

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
term the long term track will also be

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.380

now this is different than down here in
the<00:03:39.180> central<00:03:39.420> caribbean<00:03:39.930> sea<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.830> we<00:03:40.950> said

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
the central caribbean sea like we said

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.040 
the central caribbean sea like we said
yesterday<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.760> i<00:03:41.790> want<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.030> issue<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.510> caveat

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
yesterday and i want to issue a caveat

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.180 
yesterday and i want to issue a caveat
to<00:03:43.080> what<00:03:43.290> i<00:03:43.320> said<00:03:43.560> yesterday<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:43.980> made<00:03:44.130> a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
to what i said yesterday I made a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.130 
to what i said yesterday I made a
comment<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.760> systems<00:03:45.420> down<00:03:45.660> here<00:03:45.960> in<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
comment that systems down here in the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.590 
comment that systems down here in the
Caribbean<00:03:46.560> are<00:03:47.430> generally<00:03:47.850> hard<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.270> recurve

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
Caribbean are generally hard to recurve

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.150 
Caribbean are generally hard to recurve
out<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.960> sea<00:03:49.140> without<00:03:49.500> touching<00:03:50.010> North

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
out to sea without touching North

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.630 
out to sea without touching North
America<00:03:50.610> in<00:03:50.990> August<00:03:51.990> mid<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.010> late<00:03:53.160> august<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
America in August mid to late august and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.760 
America in August mid to late august and
that<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.000> true<00:03:54.300> but<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:54.990> we<00:03:55.110> have<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> system

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
that is true but if we have the system

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.280 
that is true but if we have the system
moving<00:03:56.220> into<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.300> northern<00:03:57.540> islands<00:03:58.170> instead

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
moving into the northern islands instead

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.600 
moving into the northern islands instead
that's<00:03:58.710> not<00:03:58.860> really<00:03:59.100> buried<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
that's not really buried in the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.980 
that's not really buried in the
Caribbean<00:04:00.030> anymore<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.630> gives<00:04:00.810> this

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
Caribbean anymore and that gives this

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.450 
Caribbean anymore and that gives this
trough<00:04:01.410> thats<00:04:01.740> hanging<00:04:01.950> down<00:04:02.130> here

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
trough thats hanging down here

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.070 
trough thats hanging down here
underneath<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.970> block<00:04:03.360> east<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.720> Hudson<00:04:04.050> Bay

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
underneath this block east of Hudson Bay

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.890 
underneath this block east of Hudson Bay
this<00:04:04.740> trough<00:04:05.100> has<00:04:05.340> more<00:04:05.610> time<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.900> influence

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
this trough has more time to influence

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.720 
this trough has more time to influence
the<00:04:07.080> system<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.530> therefore<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:08.070> recurve<00:04:08.460> is

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
the system and therefore the recurve is

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.670 
the system and therefore the recurve is
on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.210> table<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.720> fact<00:04:09.960> some<00:04:10.200> model<00:04:10.470> runs

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
on the table in fact some model runs

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.350 
on the table in fact some model runs
have<00:04:10.920> indeed<00:04:11.250> recurved<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.060> without

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
have indeed recurved this without

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.840 
have indeed recurved this without
touching<00:04:12.990> land<00:04:13.290> outside<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.430> Caribbean

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
touching land outside of the Caribbean

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.789 
touching land outside of the Caribbean
islands<00:04:15.300> which<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.720> guaranteed<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.260> impact

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
islands which it is guaranteed to impact

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.690 
islands which it is guaranteed to impact
in<00:04:17.010> some<00:04:17.250> way<00:04:18.020> so<00:04:19.020> if<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.500> again<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.370> depends

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
in some way so if it again this depends

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.280 
in some way so if it again this depends
on<00:04:20.820> genesis<00:04:21.239> location<00:04:21.720> we<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:21.989> this<00:04:22.140> whole

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
on genesis location we have this whole

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.320 
on genesis location we have this whole
area<00:04:22.590> out<00:04:22.620> here<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:23.160> which<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.490> could<00:04:23.610> form<00:04:23.880> you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
area out here in which it could form you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.820 
area out here in which it could form you
see<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.630> right<00:04:24.780> now<00:04:24.810> if<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.260> center<00:04:25.560> here

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
see it right now if the center here

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.750 
see it right now if the center here
becomes<00:04:26.160> dominant<00:04:26.400> and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
becomes dominant and

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.580 
becomes dominant and
moves<00:04:26.880> into<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.150> craving<00:04:27.420> like<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:27.780> it's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
moves into the craving like this it's

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.080 
moves into the craving like this it's
going<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.890> hit<00:04:29.010> somebody<00:04:29.280> it's<00:04:29.820> going<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.000> hit

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
going to hit somebody it's going to hit

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.960 
going to hit somebody it's going to hit
somebody<00:04:30.510> in<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:30.840> if<00:04:31.100> instead<00:04:32.100> this<00:04:32.550> becomes

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
somebody in here if instead this becomes

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.490 
somebody in here if instead this becomes
really<00:04:33.150> dominant<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.750> moves<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.290> north

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
really dominant and moves to the north

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.680 
really dominant and moves to the north
right<00:04:35.100> along<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> islands<00:04:35.820> then<00:04:36.060> we<00:04:36.270> open<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
right along the islands then we open the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.270 
right along the islands then we open the
door<00:04:36.900> for<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.410> actually<00:04:37.560> recurve<00:04:38.070> into

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
door for it to actually recurve into

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.400 
door for it to actually recurve into
this<00:04:38.400> trough<00:04:38.640> but<00:04:38.880> even<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.930> story<00:04:40.230> is

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
this trough but even then the story is

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.770 
this trough but even then the story is
not<00:04:40.560> over<00:04:40.790> because<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:42.240> trough<00:04:42.540> you

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
not over because this trough you

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.570 
not over because this trough you
remember<00:04:43.200> if<00:04:43.410> enough<00:04:43.650> time<00:04:43.890> goes<00:04:44.100> by<00:04:44.130> by<00:04:44.520> day

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
remember if enough time goes by by day

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.640 
remember if enough time goes by by day
six<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.510> trough<00:04:45.750> will<00:04:45.990> eventually<00:04:46.440> start

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
six this trough will eventually start

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.920 
six this trough will eventually start
moving<00:04:47.040> out<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.550> Ridge<00:04:47.970> builds<00:04:48.750> over

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
moving out and this Ridge builds over

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.570 
moving out and this Ridge builds over
the<00:04:49.020> top<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.830> on<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:49.980> ensemble<00:04:50.460> mean

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
the top and you see on the ensemble mean

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.460 
the top and you see on the ensemble mean
it<00:04:50.670> has<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.850> piece<00:04:51.150> here<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.450> a<00:04:51.510> piece<00:04:51.540> here<00:04:51.990> so

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
it has a piece here and a piece here so

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.320 
it has a piece here and a piece here so
half<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.680> members<00:04:52.980> are<00:04:53.220> showing<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:53.970> escaping

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
that far and again we will just have to

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.990 
that far and again we will just have to
track<00:06:13.590> it<00:06:13.770> to<00:06:13.800> see<00:06:14.070> if<00:06:14.100> it<00:06:14.280> does<00:06:14.460> develop<00:06:14.730> and

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
track it to see if it does develop and

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.820 
track it to see if it does develop and
do<00:06:15.060> a<00:06:15.090> tropical<00:06:15.570> storm<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:15.960> if<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.140> does<00:06:16.410> then

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
do a tropical storm and if it does then

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.770 
do a tropical storm and if it does then
we<00:06:17.040> will<00:06:17.220> start<00:06:17.490> to<00:06:17.580> get<00:06:17.910> a<00:06:17.940> better<00:06:18.150> idea<00:06:18.300> of

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
we will start to get a better idea of

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.590 
we will start to get a better idea of
exactly<00:06:19.200> how<00:06:19.770> it<00:06:19.860> will<00:06:20.010> behave<00:06:20.130> so<00:06:20.910> we<00:06:21.480> will

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
exactly how it will behave so we will

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.150 
exactly how it will behave so we will
keep<00:06:21.720> an<00:06:21.870> eye<00:06:21.960> on<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.260> during<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.800> next<00:06:22.980> few

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
keep an eye on this during the next few

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.040 
keep an eye on this during the next few
days<00:06:23.370> alright<00:06:23.850> that's<00:06:23.970> it<00:06:24.120> for<00:06:24.180> today<00:06:24.480> thanks

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
