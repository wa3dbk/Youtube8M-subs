right this is a quick video I'll show

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.360 
right this is a quick video I'll show
you<00:00:13.630> where<00:00:14.050> to<00:00:14.380> get<00:00:14.500> these<00:00:14.710> into<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.130> correct

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
you where to get these into the correct

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.430 
you where to get these into the correct
audit<00:00:15.730> and<00:00:15.880> now<00:00:15.940> I<00:00:15.969> can<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.360> do<00:00:16.779> some<00:00:16.990> cuts<00:00:17.230> on

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
audit and now I can and do some cuts on

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.890 
audit and now I can and do some cuts on
printers<00:00:17.950> that<00:00:18.520> use<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:18.790> same<00:00:18.970> see<00:00:19.240> is<00:00:19.540> what

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
printers that use the same see is what

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.109 
printers that use the same see is what
they<00:00:20.110> they<00:00:20.860> come<00:00:21.040> in<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.220> different<00:00:21.550> order<00:00:21.730> here

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
they they come in a different order here

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.670 
they they come in a different order here
they<00:00:22.420> go<00:00:22.570> into<00:00:22.720> your<00:00:22.900> printer<00:00:23.170> in<00:00:23.259> a<00:00:23.349> different

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
they go into your printer in a different

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.940 
they go into your printer in a different
order<00:00:23.920> like<00:00:24.910> this<00:00:25.090> one<00:00:25.270> is<00:00:25.480> black<00:00:25.810> big<00:00:26.710> black

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
order like this one is black big black

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
order like this one is black big black
yellow<00:00:27.880> magenta<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:29.140> cyan<00:00:29.579> I've<00:00:30.579> just<00:00:30.640> had<00:00:30.820> an

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
yellow magenta and cyan I've just had an

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.190 
yellow magenta and cyan I've just had an
email<00:00:31.090> from<00:00:31.270> someone<00:00:31.570> who's<00:00:31.779> bought<00:00:31.989> one<00:00:32.169> of

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
email from someone who's bought one of

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.080 
email from someone who's bought one of
these<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:33.070> it's<00:00:33.430> actually<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.760> different

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
these and it's actually a different

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.850 
these and it's actually a different
order<00:00:34.300> there's<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:35.079> black<00:00:35.530> magenta<00:00:36.780> cyan<00:00:37.860> big

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
order there's is black magenta cyan big

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.280 
order there's is black magenta cyan big
black<00:00:39.130> yellow<00:00:39.790> so<00:00:40.480> obviously<00:00:40.840> if<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:40.989> put<00:00:41.170> it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
black yellow so obviously if we put it

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.319 
black yellow so obviously if we put it
in<00:00:41.380> this<00:00:41.649> order<00:00:41.829> it's<00:00:42.280> going<00:00:42.579> to<00:00:42.640> go<00:00:42.850> in<00:00:43.090> wrong

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
in this order it's going to go in wrong

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.939 
in this order it's going to go in wrong
it's<00:00:43.570> not<00:00:43.690> going<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:44.019> go<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.199> it's<00:00:44.649> not<00:00:44.769> going

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
it's not going to go to it's not going

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.369 
it's not going to go to it's not going
to<00:00:45.160> work<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:46.269> what<00:00:46.480> we're<00:00:46.600> going<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.780> do<00:00:46.960> is

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
to work so what we're going to do is

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.750 
to work so what we're going to do is
show<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.649> how<00:00:47.949> to<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.339> move<00:00:48.519> these<00:00:48.699> around

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
show you how to just move these around

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.840 
show you how to just move these around
so<00:00:49.449> they<00:00:49.600> can<00:00:49.719> go<00:00:49.839> into<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.170> correct<00:00:50.350> or<00:00:50.850> all

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
so they can go into the correct or all

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.819 
so they can go into the correct or all
we<00:00:52.000> have<00:00:52.089> to<00:00:52.179> do<00:00:52.359> is<00:00:52.629> they<00:00:52.960> see<00:00:53.289> this<00:00:53.410> piping

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
we have to do is they see this piping

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.619 
we have to do is they see this piping
here<00:00:54.219> you<00:00:54.519> push<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:54.879> through<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.149> clip<00:00:55.390> of

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
here you push it through the clip of

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.150 
here you push it through the clip of
this<00:00:55.809> way<00:00:56.050> a<00:00:56.079> bit<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:56.739> will<00:00:56.829> make<00:00:57.010> this

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
this way a bit and it will make this

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.829 
this way a bit and it will make this
longer<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.850> we'll<00:00:57.999> come<00:00:58.179> they'll<00:00:58.539> come<00:00:58.570> to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
longer and we'll come they'll come to

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.380 
longer and we'll come they'll come to
the<00:00:58.960> part<00:00:59.170> out<00:00:59.379> that<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.969> you<00:01:01.089> look<00:01:01.179> there's

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
the part out that if you look there's

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.259 
the part out that if you look there's
now<00:01:01.510> come<00:01:01.719> longer<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.469> give<00:01:02.620> your<00:01:02.769> movement<00:01:03.269> if

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
now come longer to give your movement if

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.810 
now come longer to give your movement if
this<00:01:04.600> black<00:01:04.900> here<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.500> one<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.010> small<00:01:06.670> black

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
this black here this one the small black

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.130 
this black here this one the small black
there<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:07.330> not<00:01:07.420> quite<00:01:07.630> longer<00:01:07.870> before<00:01:07.990> you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
there it's not quite longer before you

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.990 
there it's not quite longer before you
have<00:01:08.230> to<00:01:08.290> do<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.470> pull<00:01:08.740> pull<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> little<00:01:09.670> bit<00:01:09.880> on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
have to do is pull pull a little bit on

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.520 
have to do is pull pull a little bit on
there<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.390> split<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.780> piping<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.230> bit<00:01:11.350> further

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
there and split the piping a bit further

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.980 
there and split the piping a bit further
down<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.970> get<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.210> bit<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.420> extra<00:01:13.780> length

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
down just get that bit of extra length

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.260 
down just get that bit of extra length
there<00:01:14.290> now<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.070> black<00:01:15.340> needs<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:16.149> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
there now the black needs that the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.760 
there now the black needs that the
chaplet<00:01:16.720> emailed<00:01:17.710> me<00:01:17.829> so<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.130> needs<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.670> blank

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
chaplet emailed me so it needs a blank

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.300 
chaplet emailed me so it needs a blank
magenta<00:01:20.970> cyan<00:01:22.680> big<00:01:23.680> black<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:25.920> yellow<00:01:26.920> so

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
magenta cyan big black and yellow so

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.910 
magenta cyan big black and yellow so
what<00:01:27.430> we<00:01:27.520> do<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.820> pick<00:01:28.149> up<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.299> magenta<00:01:28.920> over

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
what we do is pick up the magenta over

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.170 
what we do is pick up the magenta over
there<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:31.030> put<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.329> into<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.630> order<00:01:31.899> there

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
there and put it into the order there

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.090 
there and put it into the order there
then<00:01:34.180> he<00:01:34.270> needs<00:01:34.509> scion<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.469> get<00:01:35.680> them<00:01:35.770> into<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
then he needs scion so get them into the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.560 
then he needs scion so get them into the
cyan<00:01:36.430> move<00:01:37.299> it<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.869> put<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.229> in<00:01:38.380> between<00:01:38.500> your

cyan move it and put it in between your
big<00:01:40.570> blacks<00:01:40.840> there<00:01:41.110> yellows<00:01:41.740> there<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:43.270> now

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
big blacks there yellows there and now

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
big blacks there yellows there and now
you've<00:01:43.600> got<00:01:43.719> them<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:43.930> correct<00:01:44.110> order

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you've got them in the correct order

you've got them in the correct order
they're<00:01:45.520> all<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.759> correct<00:01:45.969> order<00:01:46.149> but

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
they're all in the correct order but

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.459 
they're all in the correct order but
it's<00:01:46.390> got<00:01:46.479> all<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.689> sticking<00:01:47.049> up<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.320> get

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
it's got all this sticking up so get

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.139 
it's got all this sticking up so get
your<00:01:47.590> pipe<00:01:47.740> in<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.549> pull<00:01:48.700> back<00:01:48.729> through

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
your pipe in just pull back through

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.929 
your pipe in just pull back through
tight<00:01:49.420> enough<00:01:49.689> so<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.310> they<00:01:51.520> are<00:01:51.549> sticking

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
tight enough so that they are sticking

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:52.950 
tight enough so that they are sticking
right<00:01:52.030> or<00:01:52.180> pushing<00:01:52.450> down<00:01:52.570> like<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:52.810> and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
right or pushing down like that and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.289 
right or pushing down like that and
there<00:01:53.259> you've<00:01:53.560> got<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.799> correct<00:01:54.009> order<00:01:54.299> they

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
there you've got the correct order they

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.730 
there you've got the correct order they
will<00:01:55.509> work<00:01:55.719> like<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.409> doesn't<00:01:56.439> matter

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
will work like that it doesn't matter

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.990 
will work like that it doesn't matter
about<00:01:56.799> these<00:01:57.100> punks<00:01:57.399> crossing<00:01:57.700> over<00:01:57.820> each

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
about these punks crossing over each

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.450 
about these punks crossing over each
other<00:01:58.240> ear<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.590> once<00:01:59.890> that's<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.250> like

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
other ear because once that's in like

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
other ear because once that's in like
that<00:02:00.700> those<00:02:01.570> pipes<00:02:01.899> like<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.909> fine

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
that those pipes like that that is fine

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.490 
concerned once the ring there just put
some<00:02:13.450> sellotape<00:02:13.660> across<00:02:13.990> there<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.230> hold<00:02:14.320> them
