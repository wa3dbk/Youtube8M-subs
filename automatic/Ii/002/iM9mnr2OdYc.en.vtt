look and see if we can get it to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.979 
look and see if we can get it to
redirect<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> moment<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.629> i'm<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.840> do

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.860 
malwarebytes here have a look now what
you<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.680> notice<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.399> browser<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:51.629> go

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you will notice is your browser will go

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.950 
you will notice is your browser will go
very<00:00:52.199> slow<00:00:53.210> searching<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> internet<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.840> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very slow searching the internet will be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.029 
very slow searching the internet will be
very<00:00:55.199> slow<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.809> basically<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
very slow and you can see basically the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.979 
very slow and you can see basically the
hard<00:00:59.340> drives<00:00:59.609> were<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> way<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.719> hear

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hard drives were in a way now I can hear

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.990 
hard drives were in a way now I can hear
it<00:01:06.110> okay<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.170> once<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.729> click

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it okay so once we get on here we click

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
it okay so once we get on here we click
on<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:10.140> link<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.220> start<00:01:11.549> getting

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
on the link and you start getting

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
on the link and you start getting
redirected<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
redirected like so as you can see and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.480 
redirected like so as you can see and
that's<00:01:15.000> exactly<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.750> zero<00:01:16.530> access<00:01:16.860> does<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that's exactly what zero access does you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
that's exactly what zero access does you
can<00:01:17.670> never<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> page<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.509> you're

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
can never get to the page that you're

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
can never get to the page that you're
going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.890> keeps<00:01:20.130> redirecting<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
going to just keeps redirecting as you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
going to just keeps redirecting as you
can<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.590> okay

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
can see okay

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
can see okay
so<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.820> we're<00:01:23.939> gonna<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.240> rid<00:01:24.420> of

the hidden folders that where it hides

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.580 
the hidden folders that where it hides
and<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:01.050> goes<00:03:01.230> inside<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.830> windows<00:03:03.590> directory

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and it goes inside the windows directory

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.520 
and it goes inside the windows directory
here<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.280> inside<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.820> Installer<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
here and inside the Installer and you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.259 
here and inside the Installer and you
can<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.040> sort<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.400> transparent<00:03:09.090> here

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
can see it's sort of transparent here

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.460 
can see it's sort of transparent here
and<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:09.930> there's<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.140> hidden

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
and this is because there's a hidden

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.680 
and this is because there's a hidden
folder<00:03:10.709> going<00:03:11.640> here<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.209> will<00:03:12.390> see<00:03:12.660> a

folder<00:03:13.019> like<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.820> once<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.910> see<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.180> this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
folder like this once you see that this

as soon as I click OK here it's gonna

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.350 
as soon as I click OK here it's gonna
reboot<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.579> remove<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.720> from<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.989> system

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.999 

just<00:04:25.509> be<00:04:25.629> patient<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.289> does<00:04:26.500> take<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.800> bit<00:04:26.860> of

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
just be patient it does take a bit of

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:34.330 
just be patient it does take a bit of
time<00:04:27.189> to<00:04:27.310> shut<00:04:27.520> down

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.900 

so<00:04:35.330> we<00:04:35.450> just<00:04:35.630> let<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:35.930> boot<00:04:36.200> back<00:04:36.440> up<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
so we just let this boot back up and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.820 
so we just let this boot back up and
then<00:04:37.910> we're<00:04:38.060> prompted<00:04:38.780> with<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.170> box<00:04:39.440> again

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
then we're prompted with that box again

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.000 
then we're prompted with that box again
with<00:04:40.610> another<00:04:40.940> reboot<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:42.350> remove<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.800> rest

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
with another reboot to remove the rest

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.120 
with another reboot to remove the rest
of<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:47.050> there<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.140> go<00:04:48.350> it<00:04:48.650> wants<00:04:48.980> us<00:04:49.100> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
of it and there you go it wants us to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:05:02.430 
of it and there you go it wants us to
read<00:04:49.480> boot<00:04:50.480> again<00:04:50.810> once<00:04:51.050> more<00:04:54.760> click<00:04:55.760> OK

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
so again just let this boot back up and

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.770 
so again just let this boot back up and
that<00:05:10.100> should<00:05:10.340> be<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.520> zero<00:05:10.940> access<00:05:11.330> removed

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
that should be that zero access removed

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:20.989 
that should be that zero access removed
from<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.170> system

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:20.999 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.449 

it's<00:05:21.599> an<00:05:21.779> awesome<00:05:21.959> tool<00:05:22.379> it's<00:05:22.709> very<00:05:23.009> useful
