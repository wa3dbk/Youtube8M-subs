00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
articulation and it's going to be the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.949 
articulation and it's going to be the
same<00:02:16.519> from<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> left<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> right<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:19.959> right

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
same from the left to the right so right

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.570 
same from the left to the right so right
here<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.170> get<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:24.250> turn<00:02:25.250> all<00:02:25.340> around

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
here you get like that turn all around

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:39.550 
here you get like that turn all around
like<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:27.370> knee<00:02:29.470> then<00:02:30.760> here
