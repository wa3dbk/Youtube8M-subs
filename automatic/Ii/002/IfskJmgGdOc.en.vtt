00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the all mighty math and he's obviously

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
the all mighty math and he's obviously
going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> set<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:34.290> away<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
going to set up right away in the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.260 
going to set up right away in the
beginning<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> game<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:36.059> that's

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
beginning of the game because that's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.750 
beginning of the game because that's
where<00:00:36.420> everyone<00:00:36.600> does<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.320> reason<00:00:37.760> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
where everyone does for some reason and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.030 
where everyone does for some reason and
it<00:00:38.910> doesn't<00:00:39.390> always<00:00:39.420> work<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.469> stupid

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
it doesn't always work it's it's stupid

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.450 
it doesn't always work it's it's stupid
why<00:00:41.280> would<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> even<00:00:41.790> try<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.629> honest<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
why would you even try to be honest I

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.020 
why would you even try to be honest I
guess<00:00:44.460> it'll<00:00:44.820> work<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.390> 1<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:46.640> 15<00:00:47.640> times

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
guess it'll work like 1 out of 15 times

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
guess it'll work like 1 out of 15 times
maybe<00:00:48.710> well<00:00:49.710> depending<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
maybe well depending on what kind of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.450 
maybe well depending on what kind of
people<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.059> play<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.480> still<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.710> anyway<00:00:53.219> i

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
effective i think and i have this

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.600 
effective i think and i have this
ability<00:01:38.729> called<00:01:39.650> encourage<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> oh

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
ability called encourage or is it oh

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.090 
ability called encourage or is it oh
forgot<00:01:41.909> overconfidence<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
forgot overconfidence and it's one of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.240 
forgot overconfidence and it's one of
those<00:01:44.189> two<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.790> boosts<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.950> too

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
those two and it boosts your it's too

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.660 
those two and it boosts your it's too
complicated<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.909> explain<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:49.680> boosts<00:01:50.100> move

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
complicated to explain it boosts move

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
complicated to explain it boosts move
with<00:01:51.210> secondary<00:01:51.930> effects<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.500> something<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
with secondary effects or something and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.120 
with secondary effects or something and
Rock<00:01:53.280> collide<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.670> flinch<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.560> yeah<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.829> think

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
Rock collide can flinch so yeah I think

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.639 
Rock collide can flinch so yeah I think
it's<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.610> run<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.909> powerful<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.360> stone<00:01:57.600> Age's<00:01:57.960> or

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
it's a run as powerful as stone Age's or

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's a run as powerful as stone Age's or

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
because i'm pretty sure payback wouldn't

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
sue and I'm still faster even though he

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.040 
sue and I'm still faster even though he
is<00:03:53.550> scarf<00:03:53.850> now<00:03:54.030> because<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:54.840> he's<00:03:55.020> a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
is scarf now because you know he's a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.040 
is scarf now because you know he's a
slow<00:03:55.350> wall<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:55.950> don't<00:03:56.160> really<00:03:56.870> expect<00:03:57.870> him

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
slow wall and I don't really expect him

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.720 
slow wall and I don't really expect him
to<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.290> any<00:03:58.500> speed<00:03:58.830> investment<00:03:59.340> which<00:03:59.580> he

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
to have any speed investment which he

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.690 
to have any speed investment which he
probably<00:03:59.970> does<00:04:00.209> not<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.440> yeah<00:04:01.830> he's<00:04:02.459> going<00:04:02.640> to

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
probably does not and yeah he's going to

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.370 
probably does not and yeah he's going to
go<00:04:02.790> into<00:04:02.910> cachondo<00:04:03.900> I'm<00:04:04.050> going<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.260> finish

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
go into cachondo I'm going to finish

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.380 
go into cachondo I'm going to finish
that<00:04:04.500> off<00:04:04.800> with<00:04:04.980> an<00:04:05.100> extreme<00:04:05.490> speed<00:04:05.790> easily

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
that off with an extreme speed easily

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.280 
that off with an extreme speed easily
because<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.350> pretty<00:04:07.560> frail<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:10.170> know

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
because it is pretty frail and you know

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.090 
because it is pretty frail and you know
Lucario<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:10.950> still<00:04:11.220> beast<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:13.680> takes<00:04:13.860> him

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
Lucario is still beast and it takes him

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.560 
Lucario is still beast and it takes him
out<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.520> he's<00:04:14.760> going<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.940> go<00:04:15.060> into<00:04:15.180> his<00:04:15.330> last

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
out and he's going to go into his last

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.750 
out and he's going to go into his last
and<00:04:15.930> because<00:04:16.230> he<00:04:16.530> sent<00:04:16.770> this<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.100> last<00:04:17.430> I

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
and because he sent this in last I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.460 
and because he sent this in last I
probably<00:04:18.030> should<00:04:18.330> have<00:04:18.390> known<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.600> would<00:04:18.900> be

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
probably should have known that would be

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.150 
probably should have known that would be
some<00:04:19.739> kind<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:20.270> defensive<00:04:21.270> wall<00:04:21.800> kind<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.979> guy

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
some kind of defensive wall kind of guy

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.010 
some kind of defensive wall kind of guy
but<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.729> looks<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.479> much<00:04:25.169> as

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
but it looks so much as

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.379 
but it looks so much as
you<00:04:26.500> know<00:04:26.590> an<00:04:26.740> offensive<00:04:27.190> sweeper<00:04:27.669> that<00:04:28.360> I

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
you know an offensive sweeper that I

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.969 
you know an offensive sweeper that I
just<00:04:28.629> expect<00:04:29.080> every<00:04:29.349> one<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.590> those<00:04:29.680> two<00:04:29.860> have

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
just expect every one of those two have

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.320 
just expect every one of those two have
a<00:04:30.009> lot<00:04:30.129> of<00:04:30.190> speed<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.669> didn't<00:04:30.970> want<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.120> risk

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
a lot of speed and I didn't want to risk

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.409 
a lot of speed and I didn't want to risk
not<00:04:32.259> being<00:04:32.319> faster<00:04:33.039> so<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.520> went<00:04:34.030> for<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
not being faster so I went for the

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.860 
not being faster so I went for the
extreme<00:04:35.110> speed<00:04:35.379> just<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.800> case<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:36.780> because<00:04:37.780> I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
extreme speed just in case and because I

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.149 
extreme speed just in case and because I
don't<00:04:38.050> care<00:04:38.139> about<00:04:38.259> score<00:04:38.650> that's<00:04:38.800> no<00:04:38.979> big

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
don't care about score that's no big

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.640 
don't care about score that's no big
