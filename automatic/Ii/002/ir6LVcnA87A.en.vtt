I'm at waste of a victory burst that's
actually<00:05:01.160> very<00:05:01.190> useful<00:05:01.550> if<00:05:01.760> you're<00:05:02.120> actually

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
actually very useful if you're actually

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.490 
actually very useful if you're actually
fighting<00:05:02.570> somebody<00:05:02.780> who<00:05:02.990> uses<00:05:03.170> that<00:05:03.290> so

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
fighting somebody who uses that so

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.390 
fighting somebody who uses that so
they're<00:05:03.650> completely<00:05:03.950> invisible

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
they're completely invisible

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.830 
they're completely invisible
I<00:05:04.460> mean<00:05:04.700> it's<00:05:04.940> purple<00:05:05.240> my<00:05:05.360> end<00:05:05.540> because

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
I mean it's purple my end because

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.270 
I mean it's purple my end because
obviously<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.680> need<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.950> see<00:05:07.070> where<00:05:07.220> my

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
obviously I need to see where my

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.950 
obviously I need to see where my
character<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.700> but<00:05:08.300> on<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.480> other<00:05:08.600> end<00:05:08.840> it's

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
character is but on the other end it's

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.540 
character is but on the other end it's
completely<00:05:09.470> invisible<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.130> is<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.340> pretty

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
completely invisible so this is a pretty

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.950 
completely invisible so this is a pretty
useful<00:05:10.730> tactic<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.270> use<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.570> take<00:05:11.840> me<00:05:11.930> out

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960
