00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.060 
remember
I<00:01:58.909> was<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.659> age<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.200> going<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.890> sure

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
I was that age and going and I sure

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.179 
I was that age and going and I sure
hated<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.939> when<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.420> had<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.840> go<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.409> I

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
hated it like when I had to go but I

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.730 
hated it like when I had to go but I
think<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.090> best<00:02:05.270> interest<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:06.079> of

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
getting into a car there are risks and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.520 
getting into a car there are risks and

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
with we think that the risks are much

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.309 
with we think that the risks are much
less<00:02:31.790> from<00:02:32.060> getting<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.420> vaccine<00:02:32.870> than<00:02:33.140> from

less from getting a vaccine than from

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.509 
less from getting a vaccine than from
actually<00:02:33.560> coming<00:02:33.709> down<00:02:34.069> with<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.280> disease

something<00:02:41.330> along<00:02:41.450> those<00:02:41.510> lines<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.049> there's<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
something along those lines so there's a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.170 
something along those lines so there's a
