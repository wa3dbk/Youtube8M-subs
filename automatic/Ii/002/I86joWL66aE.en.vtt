00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.900 

all<00:00:04.960> right<00:00:05.080> I've<00:00:05.200> got<00:00:05.230> a<00:00:05.380> newer<00:00:05.710> furnace<00:00:06.430> with

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
all right I've got a newer furnace with

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.720 
all right I've got a newer furnace with
an<00:00:07.180> electronic<00:00:07.840> thermocouple<00:00:08.650> and<00:00:09.250> it's<00:00:09.580> been

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
an electronic thermocouple and it's been

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.240 
an electronic thermocouple and it's been
cycling<00:00:10.030> on<00:00:10.389> and<00:00:10.420> off<00:00:10.690> very<00:00:11.080> quickly<00:00:11.830> it's<00:00:12.100> not

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
cycling on and off very quickly it's not

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.090 
cycling on and off very quickly it's not
allowing<00:00:12.549> enough<00:00:12.940> heat<00:00:13.330> to<00:00:13.360> build<00:00:13.660> up<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.680> warm

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
allowing enough heat to build up to warm

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.290 
allowing enough heat to build up to warm
up<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.459> house<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.990> you<00:00:17.140> can<00:00:17.170> see<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:18.029> coil<00:00:19.029> is

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
up the house and you can see the coil is

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.909 
up the house and you can see the coil is
heating<00:00:19.600> up<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:20.199> ignite<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:21.689> flame<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:23.109> then

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
heating up to ignite the flame and then

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.130 
heating up to ignite the flame and then
it's<00:00:24.609> starting<00:00:25.179> to<00:00:25.419> heat

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
it's starting to heat

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.010 
it's starting to heat
and<00:00:26.350> then<00:00:27.070> immediately<00:00:27.340> it's<00:00:28.240> turning<00:00:28.720> itself

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
and then immediately it's turning itself

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.120 
and then immediately it's turning itself
off<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.650> so<00:00:30.610> my<00:00:31.029> guess<00:00:31.330> is<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:32.230> thermocouple

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
off and so my guess is the thermocouple

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.640 
off and so my guess is the thermocouple
electronic<00:00:33.850> thermocouple<00:00:34.510> isn't<00:00:35.290> heating<00:00:35.559> up

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
electronic thermocouple isn't heating up

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.070 
electronic thermocouple isn't heating up
properly<00:00:36.130> so<00:00:36.370> we're<00:00:37.059> going<00:00:37.270> to<00:00:37.390> take<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.960> off

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
properly so we're going to take it off

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.420 
properly so we're going to take it off
we're<00:00:38.500> going<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.800> use<00:00:38.950> a<00:00:38.980> little<00:00:39.250> bit<00:00:39.309> of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
we're going to use a little bit of

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.430 
we're going to use a little bit of
sandpaper<00:00:39.730> on<00:00:40.059> it<00:00:40.270> and<00:00:40.780> we<00:00:40.989> should<00:00:41.170> be<00:00:41.290> able<00:00:41.350> to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
sandpaper on it and we should be able to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.860 
sandpaper on it and we should be able to
solve<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:41.800> problem

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
solve the problem

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.240 
solve the problem
okay<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.989> thermocouple<00:00:44.500> extends<00:00:44.890> right<00:00:45.040> down

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
okay the thermocouple extends right down

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.049 
okay the thermocouple extends right down
to<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:46.000> second<00:00:46.840> burner<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:48.100> just<00:00:48.460> loosen

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
to the second burner and I just loosen

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.479 
to the second burner and I just loosen
to<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.330> screw<00:00:49.720> that's<00:00:50.590> holding<00:00:50.769> a<00:00:51.250> little

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
to the screw that's holding a little

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.799 
to the screw that's holding a little
bracket<00:00:51.910> on<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.120> top<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:53.199> we're<00:00:53.949> going<00:00:54.190> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
bracket on the top and we're going to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.039 
bracket on the top and we're going to
remove<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:56.739> thermocouple<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:58.089> we're<00:00:58.839> just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
remove the thermocouple and we're just

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.979 
remove the thermocouple and we're just
going<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.379> take<00:01:00.159> a<00:01:00.190> little<00:01:00.430> sandpaper

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to take a little sandpaper

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.469 
going to take a little sandpaper
actually<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.110> best<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.739> an<00:01:02.860> Emery<00:01:03.190> cloth<00:01:03.479> and

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
actually the best is an Emery cloth and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.960 
actually the best is an Emery cloth and
we're<00:01:04.809> just<00:01:04.989> going<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.460> sand<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.729> little

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
we're just going to sand this a little

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.789 
we're just going to sand this a little
bit<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.450> we'll<00:01:07.900> see<00:01:08.140> if<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.290> solves<00:01:08.620> our

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
bit and we'll see if that solves our

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.590 
bit and we'll see if that solves our
problem<00:01:09.159> all<00:01:09.670> right<00:01:09.760> I<00:01:09.880> used<00:01:10.090> our<00:01:10.180> Emery<00:01:10.450> cloth

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
problem all right I used our Emery cloth

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.140 
problem all right I used our Emery cloth
and<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:11.170> remove<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.710> buildup<00:01:12.100> from<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.850> flame

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
and I remove the buildup from the flame

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.960 
and I remove the buildup from the flame
on<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.510> thermocouple<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:15.430> buildup

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
on the thermocouple and that buildup

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.730 
on the thermocouple and that buildup
actually<00:01:16.420> insulates<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.990> thermocouple<00:01:17.619> so

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
actually insulates the thermocouple so

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.920 
actually insulates the thermocouple so
it<00:01:17.830> doesn't<00:01:18.100> heat<00:01:18.220> up<00:01:18.250> properly<00:01:18.760> when<00:01:19.659> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
it doesn't heat up properly when the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.780 
it doesn't heat up properly when the
thermocouple<00:01:20.590> doesn't<00:01:20.890> get<00:01:21.010> hot<00:01:21.220> enough<00:01:21.520> it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
thermocouple doesn't get hot enough it

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.940 
thermocouple doesn't get hot enough it
shuts<00:01:22.090> down<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.510> gas<00:01:22.690> control<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.409> that's

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
shuts down the gas control and that's

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.399 
shuts down the gas control and that's
our<00:01:24.159> built-in<00:01:24.549> safety<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.750> I'll<00:01:26.020> put<00:01:26.290> this

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
our built-in safety so I'll put this

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.320 
our built-in safety so I'll put this
back<00:01:26.619> together<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.280> we'll<00:01:27.520> fire<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.880> up<00:01:28.150> and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
back together and we'll fire it up and

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.170 
back together and we'll fire it up and
see<00:01:28.420> if<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.869> solves<00:01:29.080> our<00:01:29.290> problem<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:31.000> right

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
see if that solves our problem all right

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.420 
see if that solves our problem all right
then<00:01:31.300> it's<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.600> one<00:01:31.990> screw<00:01:32.770> holding<00:01:33.310> a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
then it's just one screw holding a

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.800 
then it's just one screw holding a
bracket<00:01:33.940> just<00:01:34.740> above<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.920> burners<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
bracket just above the burners and it

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.620 
bracket just above the burners and it
extends<00:01:38.350> right<00:01:38.560> down<00:01:39.030> into<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.150> second

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
extends right down into the second

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.280 
extends right down into the second
burner<00:01:41.230> and<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.490> flame<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.810> actually

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
burner and so the flame is actually

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.870 
burner and so the flame is actually
always<00:01:44.500> touching<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.100> thermocouple<00:01:45.730> that

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
always touching the thermocouple that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.920 
always touching the thermocouple that
way<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.060> heats<00:01:46.240> up<00:01:46.420> properly

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
way it heats up properly

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.080 
way it heats up properly
now<00:01:47.710> we'll<00:01:47.920> fire<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.250> up<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.900> see<00:01:50.440> if<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:51.090> stays

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
now we'll fire it up and see if it stays

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
now we'll fire it up and see if it stays
on<00:01:52.270> longer

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
on longer

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:12.630 
on longer
