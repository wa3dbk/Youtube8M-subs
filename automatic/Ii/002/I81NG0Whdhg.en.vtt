00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.230 
character breathe and talk about however
they're<00:01:40.770> feeling<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.369> lot<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> people<00:01:42.090> say

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
they're feeling a lot of people say

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
they're feeling a lot of people say
there<00:01:42.389> was<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.539> ton<00:01:42.749> of<00:01:42.780> grown-up<00:01:43.259> jokes<00:01:43.499> but

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
there was a ton of grown-up jokes but

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.349 
there was a ton of grown-up jokes but
really<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> didn't<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.639> them<00:01:44.789> until<00:01:44.819> maybe

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
really I didn't see them until maybe

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.649 
really I didn't see them until maybe
near<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> end

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.760 

I<00:01:51.969> guess<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.090> only<00:01:53.450> main<00:01:53.840> problem<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.530> have

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
I guess the only main problem I have

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.800 
I guess the only main problem I have
with<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.219> that<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.549> story<00:01:55.819> is<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> touch<00:01:56.539> too

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
with it is that the story is a touch too

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.749 
with it is that the story is a touch too
predictable<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.710> mean<00:01:58.009> once<00:01:58.219> again<00:01:58.579> we're

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
predictable I mean once again we're

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.149 
predictable I mean once again we're
gonna<00:01:58.819> have<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.420> liar<00:01:59.810> revealed<00:02:00.439> backstory

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
gonna have the liar revealed backstory

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.950 
gonna have the liar revealed backstory
it's<00:02:01.520> not<00:02:01.700> gonna<00:02:01.880> be<00:02:02.119> just<00:02:02.149> brushed<00:02:02.750> over

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
it's not gonna be just brushed over

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.349 
it's not gonna be just brushed over
either<00:02:03.319> it's<00:02:03.709> gonna<00:02:03.920> take<00:02:04.250> up<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.670> good<00:02:04.969> chunk

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
either it's gonna take up a good chunk

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.999 
either it's gonna take up a good chunk
of<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.569> third<00:02:05.899> act<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.530> characters

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
of the third act with the characters

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.729 
of the third act with the characters
moping<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.850> doping<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.569> oh<00:02:08.780> Jesus<00:02:09.349> have<00:02:09.530> gone

moping and doping and oh Jesus have gone
on<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.369> on<00:02:10.429> about<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:12.049> gonna

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
on and on about this I'm not gonna

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.020 
on and on about this I'm not gonna
prattle<00:02:12.650> anymore<00:02:13.010> let's<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.580> say<00:02:13.760> it's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
prattle anymore let's just say it's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.119 
prattle anymore let's just say it's
boring<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.260> don't<00:02:15.319> think<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> jokes<00:02:15.980> are

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
boring and I don't think the jokes are

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.280 
boring and I don't think the jokes are
quite<00:02:16.489> strong<00:02:16.940> enough<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.420> make<00:02:17.629> up<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.140> such

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
quite strong enough to make up for such

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.770 
quite strong enough to make up for such
a<00:02:18.319> lackluster<00:02:19.310> part<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> movie<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.599> like

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
a lackluster part of the movie but like

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.509 
a lackluster part of the movie but like
I<00:02:20.900> said<00:02:21.110> before<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.470> still<00:02:21.830> think<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.129> holds<00:02:22.400> up

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
I said before I still think it holds up

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.390 
I said before I still think it holds up
as<00:02:22.670> being<00:02:22.910> okay<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.110> still<00:02:24.379> very<00:02:24.620> creative

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
as being okay it is still very creative

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.160

story<00:02:42.109> arc<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.530> maybe<00:02:42.680> thought<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.980> little<00:02:43.280> bit

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
story arc and maybe thought a little bit

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.740 
story arc and maybe thought a little bit
more<00:02:43.519> out<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.879> box<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.299> would<00:02:44.359> have<00:02:44.540> liked

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
more out of the box I would have liked

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.599 
more out of the box I would have liked
it<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.989> lot<00:02:45.109> more<00:02:45.349> but<00:02:45.859> I<00:02:45.920> still<00:02:46.190> think<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.519> a

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
it a lot more but I still think it's a

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.580 
it a lot more but I still think it's a
decent<00:02:46.790> flick<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.720> got<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.079> enough<00:02:48.290> for

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
decent flick it's got just enough for

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.319 
decent flick it's got just enough for
kids<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:48.980> just<00:02:49.190> enough<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:49.579> adults<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.120> think

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
kids and just enough for adults I think

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.860 
kids and just enough for adults I think
it's<00:02:50.690> worth<00:02:50.840> at<00:02:50.959> least

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.930
