and then you'll you'll have a reference
to<00:04:49.150> go<00:04:49.330> back<00:04:49.539> to<00:04:49.719> it<00:04:49.870> as<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.740> say<00:04:51.569> the<00:04:52.569> CV<00:04:52.930> DS<00:04:53.169> will

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
to go back to it as I say the CV DS will

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.129 
to go back to it as I say the CV DS will
need<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.590> be<00:04:53.740> stripped<00:04:54.009> down<00:04:54.099> AB<00:04:54.580> rebuilt<00:04:55.139> with

need to be stripped down AB rebuilt with

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.490 
need to be stripped down AB rebuilt with
your<00:04:56.289> old<00:04:56.439> DVDs<00:04:57.960> basically<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.110> just<00:04:59.139> want

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
your old DVDs basically you just want

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800 
your old DVDs basically you just want
the<00:04:59.590> bit<00:04:59.770> that's<00:04:59.979> on<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.219> end<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.699> CVT<00:05:01.090> you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
the bit that's on the end of the CVT you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.570 
the bit that's on the end of the CVT you
can't<00:05:02.080> buy<00:05:02.259> separate<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.009> have<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.430> buy<00:05:03.550> a

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
can't buy separate so you have to buy a

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.230 
can't buy separate so you have to buy a
whole<00:05:04.590> cvd<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.889> haven't<00:05:06.669> come<00:05:06.819> across<00:05:06.940> them

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
whole cvd I haven't come across them

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.209 
whole cvd I haven't come across them
separately<00:05:07.780> if<00:05:08.229> anyone<00:05:08.560> does<00:05:08.740> come<00:05:08.979> across

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
separately if anyone does come across

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.490 
separately if anyone does come across
them<00:05:09.370> separately<00:05:09.879> stick<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.930> in<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.080> comments

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
them separately stick it in the comments

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.290 
them separately stick it in the comments
and<00:05:11.710> everyone<00:05:12.370> else<00:05:12.550> could<00:05:12.699> benefit<00:05:13.030> from<00:05:13.090> it

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
and everyone else could benefit from it

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.779 
and everyone else could benefit from it
as<00:05:13.419> well<00:05:13.629> anyway<00:05:14.620> that's<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.039> modification

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
as well anyway that's the modification

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.700 
as well anyway that's the modification
I'm<00:05:16.389> not<00:05:16.569> going<00:05:16.719> to<00:05:16.810> show<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.020> how<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.259> take

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
I'm not going to show you how to take

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.839 
I'm not going to show you how to take
the<00:05:17.830> nuts<00:05:18.039> and<00:05:18.159> the<00:05:18.250> bolts<00:05:18.400> off<00:05:18.669> and

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
the nuts and the bolts off and

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.129 
the nuts and the bolts off and
everything<00:05:19.000> else<00:05:19.240> because<00:05:19.690> it's<00:05:19.870> pretty

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
everything else because it's pretty

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.159 
everything else because it's pretty
straightforward<00:05:20.529> and<00:05:20.979> anyone<00:05:21.430> with<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:22.169> sets

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
straightforward and anyone with a sets

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.760 
straightforward and anyone with a sets
pants<00:05:23.500> or<00:05:23.800> say<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.729> ex<00:05:24.849> drivers<00:05:25.469> can<00:05:26.469> do<00:05:26.620> it

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
pants or say the ex drivers can do it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.189 
pants or say the ex drivers can do it
it's<00:05:26.889> quite<00:05:27.039> simple<00:05:27.550> it's<00:05:28.150> just<00:05:28.419> a<00:05:28.599> reverse

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
it's quite simple it's just a reverse

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.790 
it's quite simple it's just a reverse
off<00:05:29.440> sort<00:05:29.860> of<00:05:29.949> what<00:05:30.039> you<00:05:30.129> take<00:05:30.279> off<00:05:30.520> basically

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
off sort of what you take off basically

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.070 
off sort of what you take off basically
and<00:05:32.800> that's<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.129> that's<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.430> Lester<00:05:33.789> mod<00:05:34.080> I

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
and that's it that's the Lester mod I

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.320 
and that's it that's the Lester mod I
want<00:05:35.860> to<00:05:35.919> share<00:05:36.129> with<00:05:36.250> you<00:05:36.430> just<00:05:36.969> the<00:05:37.120> part

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
want to share with you just the part

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.850 
want to share with you just the part
numbers<00:05:37.690> not<00:05:37.990> going<00:05:38.139> to<00:05:38.199> show<00:05:38.289> you<00:05:38.349> that<00:05:38.500> do<00:05:38.740> it

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
numbers not going to show you that do it

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.769 
numbers not going to show you that do it
I<00:05:39.009> think<00:05:39.159> it's<00:05:39.550> if<00:05:40.029> you<00:05:40.150> can<00:05:40.330> take<00:05:40.509> a<00:05:40.539> weight

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
I think it's if you can take a weight

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.260 
I think it's if you can take a weight
off<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.860> can<00:05:42.039> pretty<00:05:42.219> much<00:05:42.339> do<00:05:42.610> it<00:05:42.639> it's<00:05:42.909> quite

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
off you can pretty much do it it's quite

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.339 
off you can pretty much do it it's quite
simple<00:05:43.690> doesn't<00:05:44.379> it's<00:05:44.560> not<00:05:44.620> rocket<00:05:44.860> science

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
simple doesn't it's not rocket science

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.240 
simple doesn't it's not rocket science
and<00:05:47.349> that's<00:05:47.500> it<00:05:47.650> that's<00:05:47.860> what<00:05:48.099> I<00:05:48.129> was<00:05:48.219> just

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
and that's it that's what I was just

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.850 
and that's it that's what I was just
going<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.520> show<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:48.699> a<00:05:49.620> couple<00:05:50.620> of<00:05:50.740> other

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
going to show you a couple of other

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.529 
going to show you a couple of other
videos<00:05:51.069> coming<00:05:51.639> because<00:05:52.089> I've<00:05:52.180> done<00:05:52.300> some

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
videos coming because I've done some

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.029 
videos coming because I've done some
other<00:05:52.599> little<00:05:52.900> bits<00:05:53.020> but<00:05:53.409> I'm<00:05:53.620> just<00:05:53.770> going<00:05:53.949> to

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
other little bits but I'm just going to

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.200 
other little bits but I'm just going to
put<00:05:54.159> that<00:05:54.250> in<00:05:54.370> one<00:05:54.520> video<00:05:54.699> because<00:05:55.000> there's<00:05:55.150> a

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
put that in one video because there's a

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.459 
put that in one video because there's a
lot<00:05:55.360> of<00:05:55.389> part<00:05:55.629> numbers<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:55.990> otherwise<00:05:56.259> you'll

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
lot of part numbers and otherwise you'll

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.969 
lot of part numbers and otherwise you'll
get<00:05:56.620> confused<00:05:57.360> as<00:05:58.360> I<00:05:58.509> say<00:05:58.719> I'll<00:05:59.529> put<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.889> old

get confused as I say I'll put the old

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.459 
get confused as I say I'll put the old
part<00:06:00.250> numbers<00:06:00.580> in<00:06:00.699> the<00:06:00.789> description

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
part numbers in the description

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.600 
part numbers in the description
and<00:06:02.469> I'd<00:06:02.589> say<00:06:02.770> that<00:06:02.800> little<00:06:03.159> someone<00:06:03.460> else

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610
