00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.869 

so<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.870> would<00:04:41.169> recommend<00:04:41.770> doing<00:04:42.009> this<00:04:42.280> at<00:04:42.340> your

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
so I would recommend doing this at your

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:43.980 
so I would recommend doing this at your
own<00:04:42.940> risk

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
own risk

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.140 
own risk

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
and if you are able to do it don't do it

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.820 
and if you are able to do it don't do it
too<00:04:46.300> much<00:04:46.449> don't<00:04:46.810> make<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.020> too<00:04:47.169> obvious<00:04:47.199> don't
