00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.320 

in<00:00:25.860> this<00:00:26.070> tutorial<00:00:26.430> we're<00:00:26.850> going<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.150> look<00:00:27.210> at

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
in this tutorial we're going to look at

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
in this tutorial we're going to look at
the<00:00:27.390> skin<00:00:27.720> tones<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.290> man<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.830> make

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the skin tones of this man and just make

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
the skin tones of this man and just make
sure<00:00:29.100> that<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:30.029> they<00:00:30.240> should<00:00:30.600> be

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
sure that they where they should be

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.050 
sure that they where they should be
we're<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.860> use<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> vectorscope<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.970> do

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
we're going to use the vectorscope to do

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.490 
we're going to use the vectorscope to do
that<00:00:33.270> we're<00:00:33.480> also<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.290> fast

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that we're also going to use the fast

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
that we're also going to use the fast
color<00:00:34.829> corrector<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.910> we're<00:00:36.060> not<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
color corrector but we're not going to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.850 
color corrector but we're not going to
use<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:36.990> that<00:00:37.020> we've<00:00:37.260> already<00:00:37.470> started

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
use the one that we've already started

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
use the one that we've already started
working<00:00:38.310> on<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.910> we've<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.240> fast<00:00:39.510> color

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
working on so we've got a fast color

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.990 
working on so we've got a fast color
corrector<00:00:40.170> already<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> we've<00:00:41.730> played

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
corrector already here and we've played

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.270 
corrector already here and we've played
around<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.360> lots<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.750> settings<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.010> don't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
around with lots of settings but I don't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.550 
around with lots of settings but I don't
want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.940> play<00:00:45.300> around<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> change<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
want to now play around and change the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.010 
want to now play around and change the
hue<00:00:46.920> angle<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.300> could<00:00:48.510> mock<00:00:48.809> up

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
hue angle because that could mock up

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
hue angle because that could mock up
some<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.590> white<00:00:49.829> balance<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.910> rather<00:00:51.120> than

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
some of my white balance so rather than

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
some of my white balance so rather than
trying<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.230> instance<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
trying to do it with one instance of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
trying to do it with one instance of the
fast<00:00:53.609> color<00:00:53.879> corrector<00:00:54.359> I<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:55.019> shut<00:00:55.260> down

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
fast color corrector I can shut down

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.619 
fast color corrector I can shut down
this<00:00:55.649> particular<00:00:55.829> version<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.510> go

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
this particular version and I can go

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.090 
this particular version and I can go
back<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.019> my<00:00:58.140> effects<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.710> take<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> fast

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
back to my effects and take the fast

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
back to my effects and take the fast
color<00:00:59.429> corrector<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.030> double-click<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
color corrector and double-click it to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349 
color corrector and double-click it to
apply<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> again<00:01:01.640> go<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.059> effects

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
apply it again go back to my effects

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
apply it again go back to my effects
controls<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.050> here<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.410> second<00:01:04.980> instance

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
controls and here is a second instance

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.630 
controls and here is a second instance
of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.390> fast<00:01:06.630> color<00:01:06.930> corrector<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
of the fast color corrector now what I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940 
of the fast color corrector now what I
need<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> concentrate<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.500> skin

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
need to do is concentrate on the skin

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
need to do is concentrate on the skin
tone<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.540> sure<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:13.050> at<00:01:13.230> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
tone here and just make sure it's at the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.040 
tone here and just make sure it's at the
right<00:01:13.350> place<00:01:13.980> and<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> able<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
so to look at just the skin tone I need

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
so to look at just the skin tone I need
to<00:01:21.119> apply<00:01:21.390> another<00:01:21.780> effect<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
to apply another effect which I can

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
to apply another effect which I can
actually<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.759> reduce<00:01:24.540> down<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.079> look

I<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.159> bring<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.630> can

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
I can just bring them in so that I can

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:22.490 
I can just bring them in so that I can
concentrate<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.700> skin<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> his<00:02:03.299> face

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 

okay<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:24.000> see<00:02:24.150> I've<00:02:24.300> just<00:02:24.330> got

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
okay so now you can see I've just got

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.240 
okay so now you can see I've just got
the<00:02:24.930> skin<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.230> his<00:02:25.320> face<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.040> that

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the skin of his face you can see that

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
the skin of his face you can see that
showing<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.510> RGB<00:02:27.810> parade<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.680> we

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
showing on the RGB parade but what we

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.940 
showing on the RGB parade but what we
actually<00:02:29.250> want<00:02:29.460> now<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.120> vectorscope

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
actually want now is the vectorscope

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.690 
actually want now is the vectorscope
take<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.070> vectorscope

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
take the vectorscope

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.490 
take the vectorscope
and<00:02:32.880> i<00:02:32.910> want<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.390> look<00:02:33.600> at<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.230> particular

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
and i want to look at this particular

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.580 
and i want to look at this particular
point<00:02:35.070> here<00:02:35.720> because<00:02:36.720> I'm<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> maximize

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
point here because I'm going to maximize

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.920 
point here because I'm going to maximize
this<00:02:37.890> particular<00:02:38.040> panel<00:02:38.550> because<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.660> is

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
this particular panel because this is

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.310 
this particular panel because this is
the<00:02:40.170> skin<00:02:40.590> tone<00:02:40.980> line<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.750> want<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.170> make

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
the skin tone line and I want to make

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.130 
the skin tone line and I want to make
sure<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:44.070> particular<00:02:44.580> color<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.360> going

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
sure that this particular color is going

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.930 
sure that this particular color is going
along<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.560> line<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.730> going

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
along this line because if it's going

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.490 
along this line because if it's going
along<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.330> line<00:02:48.570> that's<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.990> right<00:02:49.200> color

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
along this line that's the right color

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.980 
along this line that's the right color
for<00:02:49.560> blood<00:02:49.950> pumping<00:02:50.460> through<00:02:50.640> skin<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.870> you

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
for blood pumping through skin and you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.780 
for blood pumping through skin and you
can<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.410> slightly<00:02:52.920> off<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
can see it's just slightly off and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.970 
can see it's just slightly off and
minimize<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.360> again<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.230> what<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> need<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.830> do

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
minimize that again so what I need to do

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.010 
minimize that again so what I need to do
is<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.190> need<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.640> able<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.970> use<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.570> second

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
is I need to be able to use this second

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.780 
is I need to be able to use this second
version<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> fast<00:02:58.860> color<00:02:59.130> corrector<00:02:59.640> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
version of the fast color corrector to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.900 
version of the fast color corrector to
be<00:03:00.300> able<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.630> shift<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.260> hue<00:03:01.650> slightly<00:03:02.280> so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
be able to shift the hue slightly so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.730 
be able to shift the hue slightly so
that<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.780> line<00:03:04.080> what<00:03:04.620> I'm

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
that it's just on this line what I'm

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.170 
that it's just on this line what I'm
going<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.890> do<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.459> Mac<00:03:05.910> summize

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
going to do is and just go Mac summize

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.580 
going to do is and just go Mac summize
this<00:03:06.390> panel<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:06.900> bit<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.350> see<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
this panel a little bit so you can see a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.710 
this panel a little bit so you can see a
little<00:03:07.770> bit<00:03:07.890> better<00:03:08.100> I'm<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.240> do<00:03:09.420> you

little bit better I'm going to do you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.820 
little bit better I'm going to do you
know<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.050> you've<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.290> got<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> skin

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
know that you've just got the skin

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.860 
know that you've just got the skin
showing<00:03:11.160> up<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.300> open<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
showing up here so I'm gonna open up the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
second version the fast color corrector

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.120 
second version the fast color corrector
and<00:03:15.180> what<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> want<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.170> do<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.410> play<00:03:16.709> with<00:03:16.740> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
and what I want to do is play with the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.520 
and what I want to do is play with the
hue<00:03:17.459> angle<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:18.030> don't<00:03:18.630> want<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.050> change<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
hue angle I don't want to change the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.010 
hue angle I don't want to change the
intensity<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.610> what<00:03:20.760> I'm<00:03:20.880> playing<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.990> I

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
intensity of what I'm playing with so I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.770 
intensity of what I'm playing with so I
don't<00:03:22.230> have<00:03:22.350> pull<00:03:22.530> this<00:03:22.709> item<00:03:23.610> out<00:03:23.850> at<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.270> but

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
don't have pull this item out at all but

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.780 
don't have pull this item out at all but
I<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.020> wanted<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.380> move<00:03:25.650> its<00:03:25.920> hue<00:03:26.280> angle<00:03:26.400> so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
I just wanted to move its hue angle so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.240 
I just wanted to move its hue angle so
that<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:27.060> right<00:03:27.360> on<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.720> line<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.920> could

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that it's right on this line so I could

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.370 
that it's right on this line so I could
just<00:03:29.519> click<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.910> drag<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.570> outer<00:03:30.720> circle

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
just click and drag on the outer circle

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.650 
just click and drag on the outer circle
here<00:03:31.890> which<00:03:32.040> would<00:03:32.730> do<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.300> kind<00:03:33.570> of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
here which would do that and kind of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.640 
here which would do that and kind of
moves<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.989> around

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
moves it around

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.800 
moves it around
we're<00:03:35.489> alternatively<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.269> play<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.600> hot

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
we're alternatively I can play the hot

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.920 
we're alternatively I can play the hot
text<00:03:37.200> underneath<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:38.090> just<00:03:39.090> take<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.780> it's

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
text underneath and just take it so it's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.050 
text underneath and just take it so it's
pretty<00:03:40.290> much<00:03:40.650> directly<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.310> line<00:03:41.760> which

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
pretty much directly on that line which

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.930 
pretty much directly on that line which
is<00:03:42.209> about<00:03:42.590> about<00:03:43.590> therefore<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.610> bit<00:03:44.760> much

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
is about about therefore it's a bit much

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.420 
is about about therefore it's a bit much
a<00:03:47.180> go<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.390> think<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.690> minus<00:03:49.110> six<00:03:49.320> point<00:03:49.560> five<00:03:49.800> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
a go I think a minus six point five so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.630 
a go I think a minus six point five so
that's<00:03:50.580> now<00:03:50.880> absolutely<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.200> line<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.799> if

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
that's now absolutely on that line so if

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.250 
that's now absolutely on that line so if
I<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:53.910> just<00:03:54.209> pull<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.570> back<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.140> this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
I now just pull this back out like this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.900 
I now just pull this back out like this
we<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.950> it's<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.430> right<00:03:56.610> place

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
we can see that it's on the right place

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.810 
we can see that it's on the right place
and<00:03:57.239> what<00:03:58.200> we<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.709> we<00:03:58.830> can<00:03:58.920> go<00:03:59.190> down<00:03:59.549> and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
and what we can do is we can go down and

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.930 
and what we can do is we can go down and
we<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.090> minimize<00:04:00.450> this<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.830> we<00:04:02.100> can<00:04:02.310> get<00:04:02.580> rid

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
we can minimize this and we can get rid

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.150 
we can minimize this and we can get rid
of<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.360> four<00:04:03.570> point<00:04:03.870> garbage<00:04:04.290> matte<00:04:04.500> now<00:04:04.860> turn

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
of the four point garbage matte now turn

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.910 
of the four point garbage matte now turn
it<00:04:05.280> off<00:04:05.430> we<00:04:06.330> now<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.200> skin<00:04:07.530> tone<00:04:07.769> is

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
it off we now know that the skin tone is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.130 
it off we now know that the skin tone is
correct<00:04:08.310> for<00:04:08.549> this<00:04:08.610> particular<00:04:08.940> shot<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
correct for this particular shot the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.930 
correct for this particular shot the
only<00:04:10.290> item<00:04:10.680> I've<00:04:10.830> got<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.370> bit<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.670> worry

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
only item I've got that's a bit of worry

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.390 
only item I've got that's a bit of worry
is<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.420> red<00:04:12.660> teapot<00:04:13.170> which<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.560> probably<00:04:14.310> a

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
is this red teapot which is probably a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.039 
is this red teapot which is probably a
little<00:04:14.640> bit<00:04:14.940> just<00:04:15.150> out<00:04:15.360> from<00:04:15.570> where<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.840> should

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
little bit just out from where it should

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.140 
little bit just out from where it should
be<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.440> let's<00:04:17.100> just<00:04:17.340> turn<00:04:17.549> these<00:04:17.760> bits<00:04:18.030> and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
be so let's just turn these bits and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.229 
be so let's just turn these bits and
pieces<00:04:18.359> off<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.750> before<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.229> after<00:04:20.150> so<00:04:21.150> you

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
pieces off so before and after so you

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.750 
pieces off so before and after so you
can<00:04:21.359> see<00:04:21.540> before<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.900> after<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:23.250> difference

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
can see before and after the difference

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.640 
can see before and after the difference
and<00:04:25.400> we've<00:04:26.400> got<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.760> original<00:04:27.000> shot<00:04:27.990> here<00:04:28.380> so

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
and we've got the original shot here so

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.700 
and we've got the original shot here so
that's<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.040> original<00:04:29.520> shot

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
that's the original shot

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.279 
that's the original shot
and<00:04:30.800> then<00:04:31.610> we<00:04:31.729> actually<00:04:31.880> did<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.449> contrast

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
and then we actually did the contrast

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.749 
and then we actually did the contrast
the<00:04:33.500> white<00:04:33.770> balance<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.340> made<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.610> whole

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
the white balance and made the whole

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.950 
the white balance and made the whole
thing<00:04:34.880> look<00:04:35.030> better<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.449> then<00:04:35.539> we<00:04:35.630> play<00:04:35.810> with

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
thing look better and then we play with

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.770 
thing look better and then we play with
the<00:04:36.020> fast<00:04:36.229> color<00:04:36.500> corrector<00:04:36.979> now<00:04:37.639> that<00:04:38.180> for<00:04:38.630> me

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
the fast color corrector now that for me

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.140 
the fast color corrector now that for me
is<00:04:38.990> not<00:04:39.289> ideal<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.830> don't<00:04:40.160> not<00:04:40.400> completely

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
is not ideal I don't not completely

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.029 
is not ideal I don't not completely
happy<00:04:41.419> with<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.960> my<00:04:42.080> eye<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:42.889> what<00:04:43.009> I

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
happy with that to my eye so what I

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.800 
happy with that to my eye so what I
might<00:04:43.250> want<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.580> then<00:04:43.729> do<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.090> go<00:04:44.240> back<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:44.660> and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
might want to then do is go back in and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.180 
might want to then do is go back in and
say<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:44.990> know<00:04:45.110> I'm<00:04:45.410> not<00:04:45.530> completely<00:04:45.919> happy

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
say you know I'm not completely happy

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.219 
say you know I'm not completely happy
with<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:46.910> going<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.660> put<00:04:47.840> it<00:04:47.930> back<00:04:48.169> a

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
with that so I'm going to put it back a

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.379 
with that so I'm going to put it back a
bit<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.770> think<00:04:48.800> six<00:04:49.160> point<00:04:49.370> five<00:04:49.520> might<00:04:49.789> be<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.270> a

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
bit I think six point five might be in a

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.320 
bit I think six point five might be in a
little<00:04:50.600> bit<00:04:50.810> too<00:04:50.990> much<00:04:51.850> three<00:04:52.850> point<00:04:53.090> five

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
little bit too much three point five

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.879 
little bit too much three point five
year<00:04:53.570> three<00:04:53.810> point<00:04:54.020> five<00:04:54.169> is<00:04:54.320> beginning<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.740> go

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
year three point five is beginning to go

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.590 
year three point five is beginning to go
a<00:04:54.919> little<00:04:55.280> bit<00:04:55.400> better<00:04:55.580> you've<00:04:56.240> got<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.509> be

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
a little bit better you've got to be

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.180 
a little bit better you've got to be
able<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.870> use<00:04:57.020> your<00:04:57.229> eyes<00:04:57.380> but<00:04:57.650> also<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.979> can

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
able to use your eyes but also you can

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.150 
able to use your eyes but also you can
use<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.639> graph<00:04:59.090> side<00:04:59.539> by<00:04:59.720> side<00:04:59.960> make<00:05:00.889> sure

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
use the graph side by side make sure

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.650 
use the graph side by side make sure
that<00:05:01.340> if<00:05:01.460> you've<00:05:01.580> got<00:05:01.610> multiple<00:05:01.940> clips<00:05:02.509> that

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
that if you've got multiple clips that

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.270 
that if you've got multiple clips that
they're<00:05:02.810> all<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.110> exactly<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.800> right<00:05:03.919> place

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
they're all in exactly the right place

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.189 
they're all in exactly the right place
I've<00:05:04.759> just<00:05:05.000> got<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.240> one<00:05:05.360> clip<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:05.780> I'm<00:05:05.870> happy

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
I've just got the one clip and I'm happy

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.379 
I've just got the one clip and I'm happy
with<00:05:06.289> that<00:05:06.410> on<00:05:06.770> my<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:07.370> my<00:05:07.639> system<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:08.210> looks

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
with that on my on my system that looks

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.460 
with that on my on my system that looks
a<00:05:08.479> little<00:05:08.599> bit<00:05:08.780> better<00:05:08.990> either<00:05:09.169> it's<00:05:09.410> just

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
a little bit better either it's just

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.290 
a little bit better either it's just
just<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.949> little<00:05:10.310> bit<00:05:10.430> more<00:05:10.789> towards<00:05:11.210> the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
just a little bit more towards the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.450 
just a little bit more towards the
yellows<00:05:11.599> than<00:05:12.199> I<00:05:12.320> would<00:05:12.500> have<00:05:12.590> liked<00:05:12.830> so

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
yellows than I would have liked so

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.249 
yellows than I would have liked so
although<00:05:13.669> I've<00:05:13.970> got<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.180> graph<00:05:14.509> as<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.750> reference

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
although I've got a graph as a reference

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.469 
although I've got a graph as a reference
I<00:05:15.500> can<00:05:15.919> still<00:05:16.370> go<00:05:16.520> in<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.729> use<00:05:16.880> my<00:05:17.060> eyes<00:05:17.210> but

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
I can still go in and use my eyes but

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.960 
I can still go in and use my eyes but
the<00:05:17.539> thing<00:05:17.720> is<00:05:17.750> eyes<00:05:18.080> do<00:05:18.410> lie<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.770> little<00:05:18.979> bit<00:05:19.310> so

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
the thing is eyes do lie a little bit so

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.730 
the thing is eyes do lie a little bit so
it's<00:05:20.120> always<00:05:20.300> good<00:05:20.630> to<00:05:20.660> look<00:05:21.080> away<00:05:21.229> look

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
it's always good to look away look

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.800 
it's always good to look away look
around<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.190> room<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.610> then<00:05:23.060> look<00:05:23.270> back<00:05:23.509> at<00:05:23.690> it

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
around the room and then look back at it

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.860 
around the room and then look back at it
giving<00:05:24.500> your<00:05:24.590> eyes<00:05:24.770> time<00:05:25.250> to<00:05:25.490> adjust<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.360> then

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
giving your eyes time to adjust and then

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.240 
giving your eyes time to adjust and then
you<00:05:26.960> can<00:05:27.110> turn<00:05:27.259> around<00:05:27.320> say<00:05:27.650> yep<00:05:27.889> that's<00:05:27.919> right

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
you can turn around say yep that's right

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.219 
you can turn around say yep that's right
or<00:05:28.610> it's<00:05:28.759> no<00:05:28.880> it's<00:05:29.060> not<00:05:29.180> right<00:05:29.419> if<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.050> want<00:05:30.169> to

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
or it's no it's not right if you want to

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.659 
or it's no it's not right if you want to
double-check<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:30.919> course<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.280> haven't<00:05:31.550> got

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
double-check it of course I haven't got

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.249 
double-check it of course I haven't got
rid<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.030> my<00:05:32.330> four<00:05:32.539> point<00:05:32.750> garbage<00:05:33.080> Matt

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
rid of my four point garbage Matt

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.860 
rid of my four point garbage Matt
sucking<00:05:33.620> turn<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:34.280> back<00:05:34.520> on<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:35.000> can<00:05:35.599> see<00:05:35.630> that

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
sucking turn that back on I can see that

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.450 
sucking turn that back on I can see that
it's<00:05:35.990> pretty<00:05:36.289> close<00:05:36.620> to<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:36.949> line<00:05:37.159> and<00:05:37.340> that's

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
it's pretty close to the line and that's

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.040 
it's pretty close to the line and that's
probably<00:05:37.820> just<00:05:37.970> about<00:05:38.389> where<00:05:38.599> I<00:05:38.630> want<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:38.990> to

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
probably just about where I want it to

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.529 
probably just about where I want it to
be<00:05:39.550> so<00:05:40.550> as<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.729> say<00:05:40.880> these<00:05:41.060> things<00:05:41.120> aren't

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
be so as I say these things aren't

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.390 
be so as I say these things aren't
always<00:05:41.780> absolutely<00:05:42.380> obvious<00:05:42.889> but<00:05:43.010> that<00:05:43.190> looks

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
always absolutely obvious but that looks

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.790 
always absolutely obvious but that looks
a<00:05:43.520> lot<00:05:43.639> better<00:05:43.750> so<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.900> only<00:05:45.050> other<00:05:45.320> issue<00:05:45.650> I

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
a lot better so the only other issue I

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.189 
a lot better so the only other issue I
have<00:05:46.070> if<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.340> just<00:05:46.520> maximize<00:05:47.000> this<00:05:47.240> vectorscope

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
have if I just maximize this vectorscope

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.800 
have if I just maximize this vectorscope
again<00:05:48.740> as<00:05:49.159> you<00:05:49.340> can<00:05:49.370> see<00:05:49.639> that<00:05:49.789> that<00:05:49.940> red<00:05:50.360> and

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
again as you can see that that red and

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.890 
again as you can see that that red and
it<00:05:50.930> goes<00:05:51.020> to<00:05:51.139> 100%<00:05:51.470> here<00:05:51.979> that<00:05:52.970> red<00:05:53.330> is<00:05:53.539> it's

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
it goes to 100% here that red is it's

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.260 
it goes to 100% here that red is it's
just<00:05:54.169> in<00:05:54.919> broadcast<00:05:55.400> safe<00:05:55.639> limits

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
just in broadcast safe limits

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.510 
just in broadcast safe limits
I<00:05:56.300> would<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.139> reduce<00:05:57.289> its<00:05:57.740> saturation<00:05:58.280> a

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
I would like to reduce its saturation a

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.730 
I would like to reduce its saturation a
little<00:05:58.550> bit<00:05:58.909> and<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.659> reduce<00:05:59.990> its<00:06:00.229> saturation

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
little bit and to reduce its saturation

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.860 
little bit and to reduce its saturation
I<00:06:00.949> have<00:06:01.130> to<00:06:01.250> do<00:06:01.370> something<00:06:01.789> called<00:06:01.940> secondary

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
I have to do something called secondary

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.200 
I have to do something called secondary
color<00:06:03.139> correction<00:06:03.229> and<00:06:03.970> secondary<00:06:04.970> color

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
color correction and secondary color

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.870 
color correction and secondary color
correction<00:06:07.000> looks<00:06:08.000> at<00:06:08.240> just<00:06:08.750> this<00:06:09.139> red<00:06:09.560> and

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
correction looks at just this red and

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.850 
correction looks at just this red and
reduces<00:06:10.880> that<00:06:10.909> and<00:06:11.479> that<00:06:11.750> only<00:06:12.080> without

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
reduces that and that only without

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.089 
reduces that and that only without
affecting<00:06:13.400> anything<00:06:13.699> else<00:06:14.090> in<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.509> shot<00:06:14.780> and

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
affecting anything else in the shot and

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.560 
affecting anything else in the shot and
secondary<00:06:16.099> color<00:06:16.370> correction<00:06:16.460> we're<00:06:17.360> going

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
secondary color correction we're going

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.140 
secondary color correction we're going
to<00:06:17.690> use<00:06:17.990> with<00:06:18.470> another<00:06:18.830> item<00:06:19.070> called<00:06:19.610> the

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
to use with another item called the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.360 
to use with another item called the
three<00:06:20.539> way<00:06:20.750> color<00:06:21.020> corrector<00:06:21.139> which<00:06:22.070> is<00:06:22.220> like

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
three way color corrector which is like

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.249 
three way color corrector which is like
an<00:06:22.520> advanced<00:06:23.060> version<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.750> fast<00:06:24.020> colour

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
an advanced version the fast colour

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.550 
an advanced version the fast colour
corrector

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560
