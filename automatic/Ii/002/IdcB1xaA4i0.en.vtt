00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello nicole ferroni found 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.520
 every day sir cohen so 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.529
 nicole this morning you decided to help 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.370
 the president yes yes because there I 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.690
 will be sincere in fact he makes me a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.219
 little bit of pain I feel like he's 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.730
 still stuck by this conflict 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.440
 Syrian 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.660
 because what happened was 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.680
 you had explained it obama he said he 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.119
 must attack syria 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.650
 behind hollande it's true he's 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.900
 rather good comrade he says yes okay 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 of the blow obama said ah bah if you want to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.230
 go go first because I 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 I have a pool with the dudes of the congress du 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
 this is it finally ends up a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 little by little stuck alone to duty 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.329
 give an answer answer that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 unfortunately there is not one you 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
 have explained it because if certainly of a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 side if nothing is done the syrians are 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.379
 facts from the other we can see that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.969
 although rhin face to want to do well 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 we risk doing well so suddenly 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 I told myself how to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.480
 that holland can mediately 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.800
 maintain a very strong position 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.449
 regarding syria ie 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.640
 continue to say they condemn the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.739
 Syria attacked the series while obscuring 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 totally the problem is that actually 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.530
 I had a real bright mans 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 with him this plasterer not very complicated 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.329
 I said to myself but finally instead 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170
 to attack syria why not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.000
 attack a sawmill a sawmill as well 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 a company you know there that do 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900
 the pallets the beams all that huh 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.420
 Syria where the apal country but series s and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 eyes to heyrieux because already then 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.100
 you will tell me I know you have 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.680
 thought to tell you but it's 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 completely con it has no relation 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.430
 good but except that I tell you 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.170
 already attacked me cyril and attack the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.640
 series was not completely inconsistent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.290
 firstly because there are sawmills in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.369
 France who are desperately waiting 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.770
 the intervention of the state 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.780
 1 I believe for example the series of breaks 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.220
 big heart in Picardy docked in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.320
 an economic situation I'm sorry 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 very difficult I mean I'm not going 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.290
 you remember it last year the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 price of beech increased by 25 % 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.470
 okay while at the same time 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.390
 orders stagnated 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.829
 the removal of a third of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.759
 jobs so berlin 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.229
 in fact they had how to say a 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.670
 kind of social plan very very 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.869
 painful then you tell me yes is this 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.799
 that a social plan justifies 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.020
 the intervention of the army 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.880
 does that justify that we see 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 invades all Picardy armored 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 merger I actually agree 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.390
 maybe not but that is what it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.619
 also deserves to do nothing especially 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.630
 when you are when it's so little 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.580
 dangerous not only for the soldiers 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.989
 because one lives in a safe bet 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.160
 thirty workers picard it is 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.180
 still less dangerous than 500 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.829
 miles 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.780
 soldiers and in Corsica with times the 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.700
 picards must still be wary and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.750
 then more 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.980
 and then moreover not say it's only for 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.430
 the only ones on Thursday will also be for 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.719
 civilians 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.459
 because that's what scares the 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.969
 france of course these are the threats of el 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.569
 al assad 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.889
 except that if instead of attacking his country 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.870
 we tell him we're going to attack a 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.819
 company who start beams that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.500
 debits beams in the oise and beats 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.030
 most certainly that retaliation 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.159
 they are smaller and especially that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.959
 will allow parallel to franÃ§ois 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.780
 Holland to continue issuing 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.730
 strong messages about free Syria 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.659
 to him after not to specify which one he 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.549
 will be able to put itself in a 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.409
 sawmill between the wood saw and the 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.379
 drill and then claim his whole to the 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.180
 radio yes you see even meaning obama I 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.430
 do not be afraid to come to the heart of 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.989
 syria i could not leave syria 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.180
 in agony you had to do something 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.650
 thing for syria and then maybe 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.849
 be cared a little at 6 am is 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.129
 what we are not going to deal with indirectly 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.269
 syrians because when holland 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.439
 must fall within this meaning any 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.909
 the wood industry of France has 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.829
 contra button heat with french wood 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.599
 a duct by steam locomotives 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.459
 French that we will have but ultimately 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.900
 our country on the road to independence 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.849
 energy 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.959
 will there be no more but 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.239
 once we will need more 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.340
 Libyan oil Gaddafi Russian gas 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.959
 poutine to make decisions and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.729
 geopolitical positions because they 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.930
 are just instead of instead of 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.060
 take because they have an interest 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.919
 I always say the one who does not have 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.689
 afraid of losing the essence of his engine 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.260
 is also the one who can say no to 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.569
 dictator to ponder that said if your 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.959
 turn next Wednesday thank you that the 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.959
 Ferroni
