growing greens in here and I am going to
try<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.420> rescue<00:00:18.630> some<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.170> plants

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
try and rescue some of these plants

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.900 
try and rescue some of these plants
figure<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:19.980> where<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.430> put<00:00:20.550> them<00:00:20.730> maybe

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
figure out where I can put them maybe

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820 
figure out where I can put them maybe
put<00:00:21.150> them<00:00:21.300> into<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:21.630> garage<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.650> buy<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
put them into my garage I did buy a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.560 
put them into my garage I did buy a
different<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> greenhouse<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.359> one

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
different kind of greenhouse this one

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.990 
different kind of greenhouse this one
was<00:00:25.500> effective<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> worked<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.849> not

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
was effective it worked but it's not

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.300 
was effective it worked but it's not
really<00:00:27.269> meant<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.900> set<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.320> more<00:00:29.160> than

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
really meant to be set up for more than

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.769 
really meant to be set up for more than
a<00:00:29.429> couple<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.789> months<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.510> really

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
a couple of months and I think really

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.780 
a couple of months and I think really
this<00:00:31.289> greenhouse<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> best<00:00:32.219> used<00:00:32.840> as<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
this greenhouse is best used as a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.220 
this greenhouse is best used as a
greenhouse<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.300> greens<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.960> there

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
greenhouse to get your greens out there

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
greenhouse to get your greens out there
earlier<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:37.950> seeds<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.520> earlier

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
earlier get your seeds out there earlier

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
earlier get your seeds out there earlier
in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> spring<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.690> set<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.170> maybe<00:00:40.350> in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
in the spring like set this up maybe in

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.280 
in the spring like set this up maybe in
February<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> use<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.120> February<00:00:42.690> februari

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
February and use it in February februari

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650 
February and use it in February februari
march<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.739> april<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.239> not<00:00:45.300> built

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
march in april but it's just not built

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.500 
march in april but it's just not built
to<00:00:46.140> deal<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.559> ongoing<00:00:47.399> winds<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.239> day

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to deal with ongoing winds and just day

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.819 
to deal with ongoing winds and just day
to<00:00:48.539> day<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:51.110> day-to-day<00:00:52.110> environmental

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to day I think day-to-day environmental

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
to day I think day-to-day environmental
conditions<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.760> didn't<00:00:54.090> hold<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.390> well

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
conditions just it didn't hold up well

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
conditions just it didn't hold up well
and<00:00:55.020> I'll<00:00:55.199> cut<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.530> some<00:00:55.739> stuff<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
and I'll cut in some stuff here just to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
and I'll cut in some stuff here just to
give<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.390> opinion<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.989> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
give you my opinion about this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.060 
give you my opinion about this
greenhouse<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.000> everything<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.410 

exposed<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> cold<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.060> growing

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
exposed to the cold it was growing

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
exposed to the cold it was growing
really<00:01:06.600> well<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.619> kinds<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> things

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
really well I have all kinds of things

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
really well I have all kinds of things
in<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> figure<00:01:09.840> out

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
in there so I'm going to figure out

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.810 
in there so I'm going to figure out
tonight<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> put<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> what

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
tonight where to put it all in and what

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
tonight where to put it all in and what
I<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.330> maybe<00:01:13.200> rescue<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> these

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I can do to maybe rescue some of these

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.780 
I can do to maybe rescue some of these
greens<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:16.250> either<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.610> garage

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
greens and get them either in a garage

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
greens and get them either in a garage
or<00:01:18.299> maybe<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> smaller<00:01:19.470> greenhouse<00:01:20.040> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
or maybe into a smaller greenhouse but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
or maybe into a smaller greenhouse but
something<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.140> keep

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
something that I can see if I can keep

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.520 
something that I can see if I can keep
them<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.680> until<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.790> end<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> phone

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
them going until the end of the phone

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
them going until the end of the phone
here<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> remains<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
here so here are the remains of the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.200 
here so here are the remains of the
greenhouse<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> stuff<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.060> going

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
greenhouse all that stuff is just going

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
greenhouse all that stuff is just going
to<00:01:30.270> sit<00:01:30.450> out<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> winter<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.860> some<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to sit out in the winter I think some of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190 
to sit out in the winter I think some of
the<00:01:32.159> cabbage<00:01:32.520> cabbages<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.299> actually

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the cabbage cabbages will actually

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
the cabbage cabbages will actually
survive<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> make<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.310> did<00:01:35.640> put<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:35.850> stuff

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
survive and make it I did put some stuff

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.460 
survive and make it I did put some stuff
into<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.869> packed<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
into there and packed it in with the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.899 
into there and packed it in with the
milk<00:01:40.470> jugs<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:40.950> painted<00:01:41.280> darken<00:01:41.700> some

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
milk jugs that are painted darken some

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
milk jugs that are painted darken some
of<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.750> survive<00:01:43.049> probably<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> garlic

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
of that will survive probably the garlic

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.310

collapsible greenhouses and again
they're<00:02:10.830> probably<00:02:11.099> best<00:02:11.580> used<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.480> spring<00:02:13.290> in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
