00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
degree it has worked however I do notice

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.609 
degree it has worked however I do notice
that<00:01:32.979> when<00:01:33.759> you're<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.630> optimum<00:01:35.140> rpm

that when you're in the optimum rpm

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.410 
that when you're in the optimum rpm
range<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.220> car<00:01:36.430> feels<00:01:36.790> like<00:01:36.970> it<00:01:37.119> wants<00:01:37.390> to

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
range the car feels like it wants to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.440 
range the car feels like it wants to
pull<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.350> right<00:01:38.380> however<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.820> adds<00:01:40.119> an

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
pull to the right however it adds an

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.749

something<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.900> little<00:03:13.200> soul<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:14.580> would

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.370 
so for that I give the SD a thumbs up
but<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.460> didn't<00:03:20.730> stir<00:03:20.910> my<00:03:21.120> soul<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.840> much<00:03:22.110> as<00:03:22.260> I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
but it didn't stir my soul as much as I

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.800 
but it didn't stir my soul as much as I
would<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.590> hoped
