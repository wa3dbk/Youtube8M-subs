still<00:01:59.610> holding<00:01:59.790> fine<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.950> blasted<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.189> then

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
still holding fine I blasted it then

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.660 
still holding fine I blasted it then
before<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.270> how<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.570> fine<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.670> couple

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
before and how it's fine for a couple

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.040 
before and how it's fine for a couple
months<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.829> I've<00:02:07.829> sprayed<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.369> gold<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
months but then I've sprayed it gold and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.839 
months but then I've sprayed it gold and
that<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.739> ruined<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> look<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> rims

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that I just ruined the look of the rims

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.000 
that I just ruined the look of the rims
so<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.390> had<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.720> take<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.560> off<00:02:13.650> now<00:02:13.980> I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
so I just had to take it off now I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:46.440 
so I just had to take it off now I
decided<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.640> peel<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:16.340> so

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.479 

I<00:02:46.510> think<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.379> looks<00:02:47.590> pretty<00:02:47.709> cool<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.280> makes

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
I think it looks pretty cool it makes

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.990 
I think it looks pretty cool it makes
the<00:02:48.670> car<00:02:48.970> look<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.690> bit<00:02:49.900> more<00:02:50.140> sporty<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:51.819> my

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the car look a bit more sporty in my

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.610 
the car look a bit more sporty in my
opinion<00:02:52.390> now<00:02:52.510> all<00:02:52.690> we<00:02:52.840> need<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.110> some<00:02:53.260> racing

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
opinion now all we need is some racing

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.550 
opinion now all we need is some racing
tires<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.910> has<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.360> BF<00:02:55.660> Goodrich<00:02:56.050> written

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
tires that has like BF Goodrich written

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.300 
tires that has like BF Goodrich written
in<00:02:56.940> white<00:02:57.940> letters<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.010> makes<00:03:00.160> it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
in white letters I think it makes it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.660 
in white letters I think it makes it
look<00:03:00.459> pretty<00:03:00.489> cool<00:03:00.879> though<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.550> better

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
look pretty cool though I like it better

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.330 
look pretty cool though I like it better
than<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.260> silver<00:03:05.260> ceramic<00:03:05.560> rims<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:06.099> whatever

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
than the silver ceramic rims or whatever

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.339 
than the silver ceramic rims or whatever
I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.790> those<00:03:10.030> kind<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.540> don't<00:03:10.959> match<00:03:11.140> with

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
I think those kind of don't match with

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.089 
I think those kind of don't match with
the<00:03:11.470> gold<00:03:11.680> paint<00:03:12.040> as<00:03:12.250> well<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:13.470> like<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.860> like

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
the gold paint as well I like it I like

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.309 
the gold paint as well I like it I like
these<00:03:15.250> rooms<00:03:15.489> especially<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.319> took

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
these rooms especially because I took

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.789 
these rooms especially because I took
off<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.560> middle<00:03:18.160> Center<00:03:18.880> symbol<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> think

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
off the middle Center symbol so I think

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.700 
off the middle Center symbol so I think
that<00:03:21.069> looks<00:03:21.250> cool

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.710
