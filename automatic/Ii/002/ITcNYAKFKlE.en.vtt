00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 Hello everyone who is in the tank 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.130
 separate hello who is on armor today 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.590
 we have one question on the agenda 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.650
 play and what's even better bend on 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.439
 Soviet gravity of the sixth level guess 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.590
 which option 1 kv-1s 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.180
 option 2 q-2 and option 3 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 t-150 and the correct answer of course 3 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.290
 speech in this video will go a t-150 so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 and proceed to start a small tour 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 in the history of t-150 or k to 150 or how it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.100
 also called object 150 Soviet 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.340
 experimental heavy tank 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.750
 family to in was modernization 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.440
 the kv-1 serial tank was developed in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.699
 1940 1941 years by engineers SKB 2 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 Kirov factory 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.010
 whom 150 differed from the base model 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 KV-1 enhanced booking 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.150
 commander's turret of three 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 surveillance devices modified 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.350
 undercarriage brackets 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.920
 the motor 5 in a forced 2 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.439
 700 horsepower consequence 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.220
 this was the increase in the mass of the tank to 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.799
 50 tons but wide combat use 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.250
 t-150 did not get the only one 150 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.390
 123rd tank brigade 11 departed to the front 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.799
 October 1941 according to archival 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.110
 May 18, 1943 was excluded from 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.140
 list of 31 separate guards 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 tank regiment as irrevocable fighting 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.220
 losses 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.100
 however in July 1943 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.380
 tank was assigned to the crew composition 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.070
 same regiment 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.880
 As for the world of tanks, the T-150 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.670
 established himself 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.480
 positively heavy car good 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.270
 booked and program 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.310
 we manage the share of luck is quite a 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.980
 suffers shots not only their 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.010
 fellow level and of machines and one 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.280
 then two classes above 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.660
 look at my fight for yourself see everything i 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 I am at the very same as we have done 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.560
 speak the bottom of the list but nevertheless i 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.690
 I bravely find goals for myself and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.510
 mercilessly destroying their words to developers 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.470
 for gold without her, I certainly would have been 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.720
 not easy but oh well t-150 is equipped with 107 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.480
 zis-6 mm cannon 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.080
 with a baseline penetration of about 170 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.750
 millimeters 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.410
 It should be noted that a similar instrument 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.840
 set to ap-5 so we 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.760
 we punch almost all cars as if 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.550
 low did not let us window 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.490
 the main thing is better to aim but with this 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.180
 mixing problems may occur 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.130
 slow so be sure to put 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.070
 reinforced pickup drives and don't forget 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.900
 about rammer and ventilation Conder Cheek 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.140
 a thing indispensable in a narrow space 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.820
 soviet unit 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.730
 set it all get recharge 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.310
 on ours about 8 seconds 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.600
 principle, not bad average damage when 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 breaking through 300 hp 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.340
 the declination of the instrument is sufficient 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.910
 comfortable and allow chili play with 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.820
 turret 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.060
 on most cards the speed of the car 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.170
 Of course not so hot but those who played on the square-1 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.540
 and apt-2 and 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.240
 I will be happy for this, for example 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.700
 the above machines on t-150 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.060
 just felt like Schumacher yet 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.700
 would be the speed of 35 kilometers per hour and money 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.960
 Well you are not twenty. on sq-1 this 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.240
 much steeper well, actually, and everything in battle 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.060
 need to feel calm and 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.940
 confidently without the need to twitch 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.030
 chose the enemy and peck it up 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.440
 blue in the face well to death 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.900
 then choose a new target and 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.690
 deal with it and so on until 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.910
 opponents will not remain unforgettable 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.690
 play the sides get up exclusively to 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.260
 opponent diamond and reduced completely 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.049
 we target the most vulnerable places well in 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.910
 principle on this i have everything 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.440
 watch the video must pay 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.590
 attention to the results of the battle 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.940
 Well, nevertheless, I got the master
