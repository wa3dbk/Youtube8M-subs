gardening<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.730> we've<00:00:23.910> decided<00:00:24.270> here<00:00:24.689> at

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
gardening and we've decided here at

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.450 
gardening and we've decided here at
Ottoman<00:00:25.110> farms<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.619> that's<00:00:25.830> exactly<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
Ottoman farms that that's exactly what

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
time we've got the ryegrass planted in

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.009 
time we've got the ryegrass planted in
there<00:00:37.160> for<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> critters<00:00:38.519> and<00:00:38.879> also<00:00:39.210> toured

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
there for the critters and also toured

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.660 
there for the critters and also toured
as<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> cover<00:00:40.500> crop<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.220> tell<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.580> it's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
as a cover crop you can tell if it's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.570 
as a cover crop you can tell if it's
boiled<00:00:42.090> water<00:00:42.210> than<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.720> grass<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.580> this

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
boiled water than it is grass but this

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.090 
boiled water than it is grass but this
would<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.820> our<00:00:44.850> first<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.500> spot<00:00:46.830> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
would be our first the first spot that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.299 
would be our first the first spot that
we're<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> transform<00:00:48.329> into<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:50.100> back

to Eden style garden with permanent
mulch<00:00:53.300> I've<00:00:54.300> gotten<00:00:54.690> word<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.289> there's<00:00:55.500> a

mulch I've gotten word that there's a

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
mulch I've gotten word that there's a
location<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.149> far<00:00:57.420> from<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
location not far from here with about a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.249 
location not far from here with about a
10<00:00:59.250> year<00:00:59.550> old<00:00:59.850> pile<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:01.320> tree<00:01:02.129> limb<00:01:02.340> mulch

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 
10 year old pile of tree limb mulch

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.690 
10 year old pile of tree limb mulch
hadn't<00:01:04.259> had<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> chance<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.860> investigate<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
hadn't had a chance to investigate it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.359 
hadn't had a chance to investigate it's
been<00:01:05.820> pouring<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.360> rain<00:01:06.630> every<00:01:06.960> day

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
been pouring down rain every day

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.210 
been pouring down rain every day
hopefully<00:01:08.369> it'll<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:09.200> suitable<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.259> come<00:01:11.039> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
hopefully it'll be suitable to come in

hopefully it'll be suitable to come in
it<00:01:11.780> create<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> layer<00:01:13.110> say<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.830> three<00:01:14.070> inches

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it create a layer say about three inches

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.080 
it create a layer say about three inches
deep<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.789> that<00:01:15.000> 10<00:01:15.660> year<00:01:15.899> old<00:01:16.310> mulch<00:01:17.310> should<00:01:17.940> be

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
deep of that 10 year old mulch should be

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.219 
deep of that 10 year old mulch should be
great<00:01:18.479> great<00:01:19.289> matter<00:01:19.649> to<00:01:20.090> put<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.300> before<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
great great matter to put down before we

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.210 
great great matter to put down before we
get<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.679> hole<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.399> more<00:01:24.119> recently

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
get a hole for some more recently

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.279 
get a hole for some more recently
chipped<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.490> Cree<00:01:27.060> limb<00:01:27.270> matter<00:01:27.569> to<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.170> on

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
chipped up Cree limb matter to put on

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.969 
chipped up Cree limb matter to put on
top<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.640> cover<00:01:29.910> mulch<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> that'll<00:01:31.890> be

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
top as the the cover mulch so that'll be

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.230 
top as the the cover mulch so that'll be
the<00:01:32.099> first<00:01:32.250> step<00:01:32.399> we're<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:32.910> going<00:01:33.149> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the first step we're actually going to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.800 
the first step we're actually going to
do<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:33.660> with<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:33.990> boxes<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.190> boxes

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
do the same with the boxes and the boxes

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
do the same with the boxes and the boxes
all<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.349> area<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.369> outside<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.910> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
all of this area to the outside of the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.680 
all of this area to the outside of the
boxes<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.410> eventually<00:01:40.709> this<00:01:40.979> entire<00:01:41.690> area

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
boxes so eventually this entire area

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.960 
boxes so eventually this entire area
will<00:01:42.929> be<00:01:42.959> covered<00:01:44.239> with<00:01:45.239> the<00:01:45.690> permanent<00:01:46.289> mulch

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
will be covered with the permanent mulch

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.970 
will be covered with the permanent mulch
I<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.750> wanted<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.290> good<00:01:49.500> look<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
I just wanted to get a good look at it

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.170 
I just wanted to get a good look at it
before<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.060> begin<00:01:51.480> that<00:01:51.510> process<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.180> here's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
before we begin that process and here's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
in the description this is also covered

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.390 
in the description this is also covered
with<00:02:18.630> rye<00:02:19.140> grass<00:02:19.470> again<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.190> critters

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
with rye grass again for the critters

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
but also as a as a cover crop so this

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.620 
but also as a as a cover crop so this
will<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.320> last<00:02:25.500> time<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.340> that

will be the last time we have to do that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.120 
will be the last time we have to do that
after<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.750> create<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.730> permanent<00:02:29.730> mulch
