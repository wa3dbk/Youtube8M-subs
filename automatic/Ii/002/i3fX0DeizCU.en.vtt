to do for a long time looking at these
cameras<00:00:15.860> one<00:00:16.250> interesting<00:00:16.850> thing<00:00:17.000> about<00:00:17.030> him

cameras one interesting thing about him

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.760 
cameras one interesting thing about him
and<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.810> shutter<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:18.140> always<00:00:18.440> in<00:00:18.530> the<00:00:18.590> top

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770

right<00:00:19.010> changes<00:00:19.490> over<00:00:19.640> time<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.450> sheikah<00:00:20.720> TFT

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
right changes over time the sheikah TFT

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.040 
right changes over time the sheikah TFT
to<00:00:21.820> have<00:00:22.820> these<00:00:23.000> weren't<00:00:23.360> boxing<00:00:23.750> ones<00:00:23.900> and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
to have these weren't boxing ones and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.140 
to have these weren't boxing ones and
then<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.260> T<00:00:24.410> 3<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:24.890> T<00:00:25.190> 4<00:00:25.370> the<00:00:25.850> T<00:00:25.970> 4<00:00:26.120> is

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
then the T 3 and T 4 the T 4 is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.520 
then the T 3 and T 4 the T 4 is
obviously<00:00:26.690> messed<00:00:26.900> up<00:00:27.020> but<00:00:27.230> we'll<00:00:27.380> talk<00:00:27.470> about

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
handy so you don't have to put the

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:40.450 
handy so you don't have to put the
camera<00:00:39.409> up<00:00:39.440> teary<00:00:39.649> ah<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:39.859> can<00:00:39.980> shoot<00:00:40.159> waist

level<00:00:41.019> which<00:00:42.019> is<00:00:42.109> a<00:00:42.170> really<00:00:42.379> cool<00:00:42.499> feature<00:00:42.620> I'm

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
level which is a really cool feature I'm

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.009 
level which is a really cool feature I'm
surprised<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.210> some<00:00:44.420> modern<00:00:44.659> cameras<00:00:44.899> don't

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
surprised that some modern cameras don't

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.069 
surprised that some modern cameras don't
incorporate<00:00:45.649> this<00:00:48.760> with<00:00:49.760> wise<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.359> t2<00:00:50.929> is

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
incorporate this with wise the t2 is

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.599 
incorporate this with wise the t2 is
actually<00:00:51.379> probably<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.769> widest<00:00:52.159> one<00:00:52.249> the<00:00:52.460> t

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
actually probably the widest one the t

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.459 
actually probably the widest one the t
AF<00:00:53.149> I'm<00:00:53.420> Reginald<00:00:53.749> I<00:00:53.929> like<00:00:54.050> putt<00:00:54.379> a<00:00:54.409> little

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
AF I'm Reginald I like putt a little

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.069 
AF I'm Reginald I like putt a little
thinner<00:00:54.739> and<00:00:54.949> then<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.639> T<00:00:55.850> for<00:00:56.179> obviously<00:00:56.989> the

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
thinner and then the T for obviously the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.049 
thinner and then the T for obviously the
smallest<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.679> thinnest<00:00:57.889> one<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.579> t4<00:00:58.940> was

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
smallest and thinnest one so the t4 was

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.910 
smallest and thinnest one so the t4 was
a<00:00:59.089> major<00:00:59.329> improvement<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.289> terms<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.620> design

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
a major improvement in terms of design

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.430 
a major improvement in terms of design
as<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.609> can<00:01:01.760> see<00:01:01.969> more<00:01:02.510> modern<00:01:02.960> smaller

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
as you can see more modern smaller

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.500 
as you can see more modern smaller
sleeker<00:01:04.900> here's<00:01:05.900> my<00:01:06.020> glasses<00:01:06.260> as<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.940> reference

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.440 

height<00:01:11.510> wise<00:01:11.690> same<00:01:11.990> deal<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.530> t<00:01:13.060> AF<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
height wise same deal the t AF is on the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.520 
height wise same deal the t AF is on the
far<00:01:14.630> left<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:14.930> then<00:01:15.050> thus<00:01:15.230> t2<00:01:15.590> t3<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.000> T<00:01:17.180> 4

t4<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.680> lot<00:01:18.860> smaller<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:22.960> let's<00:01:23.960> talk<00:01:24.020> about

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
t4 is a lot smaller so let's talk about

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.980 
t4 is a lot smaller so let's talk about
each<00:01:24.350> camera<00:01:24.560> individually<00:01:25.660> first<00:01:26.660> ones<00:01:26.900> the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
have a lot of dates on these I couldn't

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.610 
have a lot of dates on these I couldn't
actually<00:01:30.710> find<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.220> much<00:01:31.370> stuff<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:31.730> these

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
actually find that much stuff on these

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.950 
actually find that much stuff on these
the<00:01:33.620> TAF<00:01:34.160> is<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.670> most<00:01:34.850> 80s<00:01:35.240> looking<00:01:35.360> one<00:01:35.630> it

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
the TAF is the most 80s looking one it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.990 
the TAF is the most 80s looking one it
doesn't<00:01:36.110> have<00:01:36.200> DX<00:01:36.560> coating<00:01:36.860> for<00:01:37.010> film<00:01:37.190> rewind

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the T's are built into the camera but

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.490 
the T's are built into the camera but
there's<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> pretty<00:01:44.780> good<00:01:44.900> camera<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.290> think

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
there's a pretty good camera I think

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.230 
there's a pretty good camera I think
issue<00:01:45.920> with<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:46.370> actually<00:01:46.520> use<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.090> I

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
issue with this I actually use it and I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.700 
issue with this I actually use it and I
had<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> lot<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.660> autofocus<00:01:48.230> issues<00:01:48.470> with<00:01:48.620> this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
had a lot of autofocus issues with this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.650 
had a lot of autofocus issues with this
one<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> auto<00:01:49.280> focusing<00:01:49.760> wasn't

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
one so the auto focusing wasn't

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.870 
one so the auto focusing wasn't
perfected<00:01:51.200> yet<00:01:51.380> when<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:52.010> came<00:01:52.190> out<00:01:52.310> that's

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
perfected yet when this came out that's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.090 
perfected yet when this came out that's
an<00:01:53.060> insane<00:01:53.510> date<00:01:54.140> back<00:01:54.760> that's<00:01:55.760> way<00:01:55.880> too<00:01:55.910> much

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.070 

next<00:02:00.730> one<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.060> t2<00:02:02.190> t2<00:02:03.190> I've<00:02:03.670> used<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:04.600> I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
next one is the t2 t2 I've used and I

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.080 
next one is the t2 t2 I've used and I
think<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.800> works<00:02:05.980> pretty<00:02:06.130> well<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:06.940> just

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
think it works pretty well but I just

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.370 
think it works pretty well but I just
don't<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.480> way<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.690> looks<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.140> kind<00:02:08.320> of

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
don't like the way it looks it's kind of

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.550 
don't like the way it looks it's kind of
a<00:02:08.530> twinning<00:02:08.830> between<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.880> older<00:02:10.149> TAF<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.990> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
a twinning between the older TAF and the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.730 
a twinning between the older TAF and the
newer<00:02:12.300> t4<00:02:13.300> s<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.510> T<00:02:13.600> threes<00:02:13.900> button<00:02:14.560> placement

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
newer t4 s and T threes button placement

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.900 
newer t4 s and T threes button placement
on<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:14.950> top<00:02:15.130> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.460> ugly

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
on the top kind of ugly

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.040 
on the top kind of ugly
nothing<00:02:16.630> really<00:02:16.930> sexy<00:02:17.230> about<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.530> camera<00:02:17.890> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
nothing really sexy about this camera I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.120 
nothing really sexy about this camera I
believe<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.350> autofocus<00:02:20.740> started

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
believe that the autofocus started

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.960 
believe that the autofocus started
getting<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.460> better

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
getting a little better

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.260 
getting a little better
cameron<00:02:22.660> brush<00:02:22.810> shot<00:02:22.960> with<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.200> one<00:02:23.320> but

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
cameron brush shot with this one but

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.760 
cameron brush shot with this one but
autofocus<00:02:25.270> wasn't<00:02:25.630> as<00:02:25.780> bad<00:02:25.960> as<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.200> TAF<00:02:26.590> which

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
autofocus wasn't as bad as a TAF which

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.260 
autofocus wasn't as bad as a TAF which
has<00:02:26.920> which<00:02:27.220> was<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.580> lot<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.910> hunting<00:02:28.120> and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
has which was a lot of hunting and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.810 
has which was a lot of hunting and
pecking<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:30.250> thing<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.430> didn't<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.670> this

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
pecking the one thing I didn't like this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.040 
pecking the one thing I didn't like this
about<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.120> cameras<00:02:31.420> they<00:02:31.510> use<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> really

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
about this cameras they use a really

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.580 
about this cameras they use a really
weird<00:02:32.200> battery<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.730> cr5<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:35.500> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
weird battery that to cr5 kind of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.620 
weird battery that to cr5 kind of
impossible<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.340> now<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.880> bet<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.390> could

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
impossible to get now I bet you could

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.040 
impossible to get now I bet you could
get<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.110> very<00:02:38.520> inconvenient<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:40.959> of

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
get it but very inconvenient so out of

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.880 
get it but very inconvenient so out of
the<00:02:41.170> T<00:02:41.320> series<00:02:41.500> my<00:02:41.980> least<00:02:42.190> favorite<00:02:42.459> one<00:02:46.890> the

the T series my least favorite one the

next<00:02:48.070> one<00:02:48.190> we're<00:02:48.400> going<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.550> talk<00:02:48.670> about<00:02:48.700> is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
next one we're going to talk about is

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.330 
next one we're going to talk about is
the<00:02:49.450> t3<00:02:52.140> t3<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.350> moving<00:02:53.620> more<00:02:54.010> towards<00:02:54.280> a

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the t3 t3 is moving more towards a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.120 
the t3 t3 is moving more towards a
modern<00:02:54.580> camera<00:02:58.560> t3<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> only<00:02:59.830> one<00:02:59.980> with

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
modern camera t3 is the only one with

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.460 
modern camera t3 is the only one with
the<00:03:00.280> 35<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.239> 8<00:03:01.390> lens<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.810> think<00:03:01.989> all<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> other

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
the 35 to 8 lens I think all the other

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.970 
the 35 to 8 lens I think all the other
ones<00:03:02.650> have<00:03:02.739> 35<00:03:03.220> 3<00:03:03.489> fives<00:03:04.650> again<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.800> carl

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
ones have 35 3 fives again the carl

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.130 
ones have 35 3 fives again the carl
zeiss<00:03:06.070> lenses<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.700> pretty<00:03:07.360> nice<00:03:07.540> lenses<00:03:07.900> a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
zeiss lenses so pretty nice lenses a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.650 
zeiss lenses so pretty nice lenses a
little<00:03:08.590> bit<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.769> back<00:03:08.920> history<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.400> that

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
little bit of back history is that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.449 
little bit of back history is that
Yashica<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:10.810> making<00:03:11.260> lenses<00:03:11.650> for<00:03:11.800> zeiss<00:03:12.010> and

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
Yashica was making lenses for zeiss and

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.970 
Yashica was making lenses for zeiss and
at<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.000> at<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.420> point<00:03:13.600> in<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> 80s<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
at this at this point in the 80s and the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.430 
at this at this point in the 80s and the
90s<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.790> Sony<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.420> Sony's<00:03:17.200> getting

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
90s now it's Sony and Sony's getting

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.130 
90s now it's Sony and Sony's getting
Zeiss<00:03:17.709> lenses<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.299> story<00:03:19.570> this

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
Zeiss lenses so this is the story this

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.720 
Zeiss lenses so this is the story this
is<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.320> first<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:21.130> adds<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> waist

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
is the first one that adds the waist

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.539 
is the first one that adds the waist
level<00:03:21.850> viewfinder<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:26.430> remember<00:03:27.430> shooting

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
level viewfinder I remember shooting

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.009 
level viewfinder I remember shooting
with<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:27.850> one<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.239> think<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.630> autofocus

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
with this one and I think the autofocus

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.600 
with this one and I think the autofocus
is<00:03:29.290> getting<00:03:29.500> incrementally<00:03:30.070> better<00:03:30.190> but<00:03:30.459> not

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
is getting incrementally better but not

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.970 
is getting incrementally better but not
a<00:03:30.640> lot<00:03:30.910> better<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.540> t3<00:03:32.200> all<00:03:32.500> focus<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.830> little

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
a lot better so t3 all focus a little

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.310 
a lot better so t3 all focus a little
bit<00:03:33.160> better<00:03:33.280> than<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.489> t2<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.390> that's<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
bit better than the t2 and that's the

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.990 
bit better than the t2 and that's the
back<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.070> rewind<00:03:36.340> mechanism<00:03:36.790> because

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
back the rewind mechanism because

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.580 
back the rewind mechanism because
there's<00:03:37.150> no<00:03:37.209> back<00:03:37.360> it's<00:03:37.510> easy<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.690> see<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:38.049> very

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
there's no back it's easy to see is very

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.240 
there's no back it's easy to see is very
similar<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.070> all<00:03:39.190> three<00:03:39.400> models<00:03:39.549> so<00:03:39.880> not<00:03:40.870> much

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
similar in all three models so not much

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.390 
similar in all three models so not much
variation<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.760> improvement<00:03:43.390> there<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.280> the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
variation and improvement there so the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.740 
variation and improvement there so the
t4<00:03:45.640> their<00:03:45.850> granddaddy<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.209> them<00:03:46.269> all<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.660> is

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
t4 their granddaddy of them all this is

22 15 year old cameras and so that's the
last<00:04:32.740> thing<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:32.949> want<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.160> talk<00:04:33.250> about<00:04:33.490> pricing

especially<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.400> t4<00:04:36.850> 3<00:04:37.330> or<00:04:37.419> $400<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.410> think

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
especially the t4 3 or $400 and I think

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.020 
especially the t4 3 or $400 and I think
that's<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.100> bit<00:04:39.220> much<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.580> think<00:04:39.790> if<00:04:39.910> you're

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
be better to get something digital to be

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.409 
be better to get something digital to be
honest<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.860> then<00:04:44.979> maybe<00:04:45.639> looking<00:04:46.180> at<00:04:46.270> other

t2<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.280> things<00:05:15.580> like<00:05:15.729> that<00:05:15.910> which<00:05:16.120> are<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:17.320> step

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
t2 and things like that which are a step

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.469 
t2 and things like that which are a step
above<00:05:17.800> this<00:05:18.070> camera<00:05:18.430> but<00:05:18.610> these<00:05:18.820> she<00:05:18.970> could<00:05:19.120> t4

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
above this camera but these she could t4

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.909 
above this camera but these she could t4
probably<00:05:19.870> that's<00:05:19.960> why<00:05:20.050> it's<00:05:20.229> so<00:05:20.380> famous<00:05:20.590> and

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
probably that's why it's so famous and

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.680 
probably that's why it's so famous and
so<00:05:21.490> collected<00:05:21.910> because<00:05:22.030> it's<00:05:22.300> right<00:05:22.450> there

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
so collected because it's right there

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.650 
so collected because it's right there
it's<00:05:22.840> like<00:05:22.930> a<00:05:23.400> it's<00:05:24.400> affordable<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.479> some

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
it's like a it's affordable to some

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.719 
it's like a it's affordable to some
degree<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.169> it's<00:05:26.860> a<00:05:26.919> very<00:05:27.130> good<00:05:27.310> camera<00:05:27.580> so

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
degree and it's a very good camera so

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.180 
degree and it's a very good camera so
very<00:05:27.970> good<00:05:28.150> point<00:05:28.570> shoot<00:05:28.720> camera<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:30.010> would

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
very good point shoot camera and I would

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.409 
very good point shoot camera and I would
say<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.580> it's<00:05:30.700> probably<00:05:30.760> one<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> best

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
say that it's probably one of the best

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.589 
say that it's probably one of the best

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
pictures from this camera I've been

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.879 
pictures from this camera I've been
using<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.810> lot<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.990> magazines<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.740> lot<00:05:41.860> of

using a lot of magazines and a lot of

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.060 
using a lot of magazines and a lot of
editorials<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.910> just<00:05:43.180> looks<00:05:43.690> great<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.289> has<00:05:45.039> a

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
editorials it just looks great so has a

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.589 
editorials it just looks great so has a
contrast<00:05:45.520> II<00:05:45.669> feel<00:05:45.849> that<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:46.090> get<00:05:46.210> from<00:05:46.419> these

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
contrast II feel that you get from these

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.980 
contrast II feel that you get from these
ice<00:05:46.780> lenses<00:05:47.260> and<00:05:47.729> so<00:05:48.729> yeah<00:05:49.599> they're<00:05:49.780> really

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
ice lenses and so yeah they're really

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.540 
ice lenses and so yeah they're really
overpriced<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.590> I<00:05:50.800> probably<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.250> think<00:05:51.280> the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
overpriced and I probably I think the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.460 
overpriced and I probably I think the
rest<00:05:51.729> of<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:51.940> T<00:05:52.090> series<00:05:52.360> paying<00:05:52.840> more<00:05:53.050> than<00:05:53.229> 50

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
rest of the T series paying more than 50

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.740 
rest of the T series paying more than 50
60<00:05:53.770> dollars<00:05:53.800> for<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.250> body<00:05:54.490> probably<00:05:55.360> overkill

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
60 dollars for a body probably overkill

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.520 
60 dollars for a body probably overkill
I<00:05:55.960> think<00:05:56.169> you<00:05:56.260> can<00:05:56.380> get<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.530> good<00:05:56.800> film<00:05:57.700> SLR<00:05:58.530> with

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
I think you can get a good film SLR with

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.020 
I think you can get a good film SLR with
a<00:05:59.560> lens<00:05:59.860> for<00:06:00.070> around<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.460> same<00:06:00.639> price<00:06:00.849> and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
a lens for around that same price and

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.400 
a lens for around that same price and
that's<00:06:01.210> what<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.360> would<00:06:01.539> do<00:06:01.690> if<00:06:01.810> we<00:06:01.900> want<00:06:02.229> to<00:06:02.289> get

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
that's what I would do if we want to get

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.900 
that's what I would do if we want to get
into<00:06:02.530> film<00:06:02.740> photography<00:06:02.860> if<00:06:03.729> we're<00:06:03.849> looking

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
into film photography if we're looking

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.760 
into film photography if we're looking
at<00:06:04.060> a<00:06:04.150> point<00:06:04.330> shoot<00:06:04.660> take<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.020> hard<00:06:05.380> look<00:06:05.500> at<00:06:05.620> the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
at a point shoot take a hard look at the

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.210 
at a point shoot take a hard look at the
Olympus<00:06:06.039> Stylus<00:06:06.190> epic<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.789> very<00:06:07.330> good<00:06:07.570> camera

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
Olympus Stylus epic a very good camera

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.529 
Olympus Stylus epic a very good camera
that's<00:06:09.220> a<00:06:09.340> lot<00:06:09.610> cheaper<00:06:09.789> you<00:06:10.180> know<00:06:10.270> selling

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
that's a lot cheaper you know selling

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.810 
that's a lot cheaper you know selling
for<00:06:10.690> thirty<00:06:10.840> to<00:06:10.990> forty<00:06:11.289> dollars<00:06:11.560> and<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.610> think

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
for thirty to forty dollars and I think

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.490 
for thirty to forty dollars and I think
it's<00:06:12.910> a<00:06:12.940> lot<00:06:13.090> easier<00:06:13.120> to<00:06:13.389> use<00:06:13.570> its<00:06:13.810> though<00:06:14.020> T's

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
it's a lot easier to use its though T's

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.190 
it's a lot easier to use its though T's
before<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.669> secret<00:06:16.090> t4<00:06:16.479> had<00:06:16.720> terrible

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
before the secret t4 had terrible

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.800 
before the secret t4 had terrible
autofocus<00:06:17.830> and<00:06:18.820> that's<00:06:19.240> just<00:06:19.389> the<00:06:19.479> truth<00:06:19.630> I've

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
autofocus and that's just the truth I've

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.600 
autofocus and that's just the truth I've
shot<00:06:20.169> with<00:06:20.289> him<00:06:20.410> before<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:20.860> did<00:06:21.250> not<00:06:21.370> like<00:06:21.520> the

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
shot with him before I did not like the

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.580 
shot with him before I did not like the
autofocus<00:06:21.820> on<00:06:22.090> them<00:06:22.240> so<00:06:22.419> the<00:06:22.930> t4<00:06:23.229> for<00:06:23.380> me<00:06:23.469> is

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
autofocus on them so the t4 for me is

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.450 
autofocus on them so the t4 for me is
the<00:06:23.680> clear<00:06:23.860> winner<00:06:23.890> my<00:06:24.430> favorite

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460
