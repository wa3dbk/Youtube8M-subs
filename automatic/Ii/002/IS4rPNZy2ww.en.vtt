00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that she had ordered and the first

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.240 
that she had ordered and the first
couple<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.410> days<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.920> working<00:00:23.220> really

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
couple of days it was working really

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.980 
couple of days it was working really
well<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> then<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.170> experienced<00:00:26.689> burning<00:00:27.689> in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
well and then I experienced burning in

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.650 
well and then I experienced burning in
my<00:00:28.230> face<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:28.769> face<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.369> fire<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
my face and my face was on fire and that
was<00:00:30.779> probably<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> notion<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:31.980> i

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
was probably because the notion that i

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.290 
was probably because the notion that i
was<00:00:32.369> using<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:33.149> before<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.469> using
