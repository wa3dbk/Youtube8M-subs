00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
mostly the most simple thing well

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.250 
mostly the most simple thing well
there's<00:00:20.850> two<00:00:20.970> designs<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.109> hangs

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
there's two designs here one that hangs

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.570 
there's two designs here one that hangs
off<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> wall<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.039> that's<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> wall

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
off the wall and one that's in the wall

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.759 
off the wall and one that's in the wall
both<00:00:23.820> look<00:00:24.029> fine<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.539> prefer<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
both look fine I prefer this one but it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.500 
both look fine I prefer this one but it
doesn't<00:00:26.400> matter<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.820> whatever<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.269> like

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
doesn't matter it's whatever you like

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.290 
doesn't matter it's whatever you like
the<00:00:28.170> problem<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.939> switch

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the problem is with this is the switch

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
the problem is with this is the switch
the<00:00:30.660> lever<00:00:30.869> has<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:31.920> next<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.219> lamps

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the lever has to be right next to lamps

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
the lever has to be right next to lamps
as<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.690> move<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.350> right

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
as you can see if I move this one right

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
as you can see if I move this one right
here<00:00:34.590> only<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.700> one's<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> activate

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
here only this one's going to activate

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
here only this one's going to activate
this<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.320> will<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.890> too<00:00:38.070> far<00:00:38.309> away<00:00:38.340> so

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
this one will not it's too far away so

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.970 
this one will not it's too far away so
simply<00:00:39.570> will<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.469> levers<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
simply will have to put two levers and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770 
simply will have to put two levers and

to do here is I'm actually going to go

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.899 
to do here is I'm actually going to go
behind<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.149> create<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.990> hole<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.890> where<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
behind it create a hole here where the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.880 
behind it create a hole here where the
redstone<00:02:00.240> lamp<00:02:00.420> actually<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
as you can see there it is and basically

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.170 
as you can see there it is and basically
this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.680> simple<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:05.969> going

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
this is really simple we're just going

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.320 
this is really simple we're just going
to<00:02:06.240> create<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.719> pathway<00:02:07.170> from<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> redstone<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
to create a pathway from the redstone to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.969 
to create a pathway from the redstone to
the<00:02:09.450> next<00:02:09.690> redstone<00:02:10.080> lamp<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the next redstone lamp so that way the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
the next redstone lamp so that way the
redstone<00:02:11.370> lamps<00:02:11.700> link<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
redstone lamps link up in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.530 
redstone lamps link up in
basically<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.040> we're<00:02:14.219> going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.849> you
