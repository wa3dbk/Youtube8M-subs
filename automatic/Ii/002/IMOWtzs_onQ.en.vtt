anywhere between that like if you want
more<00:00:34.380> sugar<00:00:34.680> sugar<00:00:35.750> it's<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:36.870> easy<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.530> do

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
more sugar sugar it's really easy to do

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080 
more sugar sugar it's really easy to do
these<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> bottom<00:00:38.520> instead<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
these because the bottom instead of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.170 
these because the bottom instead of
crushing<00:00:39.719> them<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:39.989> audio<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.590> put

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
crushing them up audio to do is just put

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
crushing them up audio to do is just put
one<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.390> milliliters<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> bottom

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
one of these milliliters on the bottom

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.000 
one of these milliliters on the bottom
so<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.800> bottoms<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.049 
so this will be like the bottoms of the
bushes<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.640> don't<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> crush

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
bushes because you don't have a crush

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.510

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
put it in and now what you have to do is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.140 
put it in and now what you have to do is
mix<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> by<00:01:21.960> hand<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.700> it'll<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> little

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
mix it by hand and it'll take a little

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.600 
mix it by hand and it'll take a little
while<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.920> they<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.220> go

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
while because they don't like go

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.399 
while because they don't like go
together<00:01:26.790> very<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:29.930> okay<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.200> looks<00:01:31.259> like

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
together very well okay so it looks like

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.920 
together very well okay so it looks like
this<00:01:31.619> pale<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:33.600> easier<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this pale and that's just it's easier to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.550 
this pale and that's just it's easier to
mix<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> fork<00:01:34.439> yeah<00:01:34.650> coming<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:36.560> what

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
mix with a fork yeah coming up and what

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.789 
mix with a fork yeah coming up and what
you<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.070> add<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> sugar<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.799> I'm

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:39.040 

so<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:29.100> at<00:02:30.050> 350<00:02:31.130> 375<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.550> I'm<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> done<00:02:38.400> now

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
so it's at 350 375 and I'm so done now

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.480 
so it's at 350 375 and I'm so done now
we<00:02:40.050> can<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.440> done<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:44.310> then

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
we can have this done when it's and then

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.070 
we can have this done when it's and then
you<00:02:44.910> let<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.090> cool<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.540> little<00:02:45.600> while<00:02:45.840> so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
you let it cool for a little while so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.050 
you let it cool for a little while so
it'll<00:02:46.290> be<00:02:46.380> hard<00:02:47.280> enough<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.880> take

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
it'll be hard enough that you can take

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.080 
it'll be hard enough that you can take
it<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.450> now<00:02:49.110> what<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.320> do<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:50.220> got

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
it out and now what you do is you I got

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.610 
it out and now what you do is you I got
blueberries<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.080> depends<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.410> what<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
blueberries but it depends on what you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.190 
blueberries but it depends on what you
want<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:54.330> take<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.960> then<00:02:54.990> you

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
want but you take a little and then you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.270 
want but you take a little and then you
put<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.560> top<00:02:55.710> because<00:02:55.920> they're<00:02:56.100> going<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
put it on top because they're going to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.950 
put it on top because they're going to
keep<00:02:56.430> down<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.480> guess<00:02:57.690> you'll<00:02:57.810> see

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
keep down a little so I guess you'll see

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.690 
keep down a little so I guess you'll see
you<00:02:58.020> later<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:58.830> then<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.100> came<00:02:59.280> down<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.490> little

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
you later but then I came down a little

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:11.190 
you later but then I came down a little
and<00:02:59.880> you<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.120> put<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.420> top<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.870> then

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.200 

it<00:03:11.739> looks<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.340> good<00:03:12.489> yeah<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:14.050> end
