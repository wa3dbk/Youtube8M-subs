cydia store and i think just about
anybody<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:25.200> writes<00:03:25.380> an<00:03:25.560> apt<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:25.860> go<00:03:25.980> up

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
anybody that writes an apt and go up

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.190 
anybody that writes an apt and go up
here<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.550> if<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.210> haven't<00:03:27.390> hosted<00:03:27.630> through

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
here and if they haven't hosted through

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.420 
here and if they haven't hosted through
a<00:03:28.440> mod<00:03:29.370> my<00:03:29.580> iphone<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.920> spazio<00:03:31.920> places<00:03:32.310> like

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
a mod my iphone or I spazio places like

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190 
a mod my iphone or I spazio places like
that<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.610> believe<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.240> anybody<00:03:33.570> can<00:03:33.960> make<00:03:34.020> a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
that I believe that anybody can make a

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.280 
that I believe that anybody can make a
paid<00:03:34.560> app<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.040> receive<00:03:35.790> money<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.540> want

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
paid app and receive money for it I want

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.970 
paid app and receive money for it I want
to<00:03:37.380> say<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:37.740> reading<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.220> before<00:03:39.740> you<00:03:40.740> get<00:03:40.950> a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
to say I was reading it before you get a

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.370 
to say I was reading it before you get a
little<00:03:41.220> news<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.810> get<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> little<00:03:43.080> interview

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
little news you get a little interview

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.750 
little news you get a little interview
about<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.010> little<00:03:44.100> article<00:03:44.430> about<00:03:44.640> it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
about it and a little article about it

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.960 
about it and a little article about it
here<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.170> believe<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.350> he<00:03:46.560> said<00:03:46.890> he's<00:03:47.700> doing

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
here I believe that he said he's doing

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.550 
here I believe that he said he's doing
the<00:03:48.150> same<00:03:48.330> thing<00:03:48.510> as<00:03:48.630> Apple<00:03:48.959> all<00:03:49.140> he's<00:03:49.350> getting

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the same thing as Apple all he's getting

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.630 
the same thing as Apple all he's getting
from<00:03:50.010> other<00:03:50.370> peoples<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.200> thirty<00:03:52.200> percent<00:03:52.640> so

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
from other peoples is thirty percent so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.180 
from other peoples is thirty percent so
that's<00:03:54.150> pretty<00:03:54.420> good<00:03:54.620> still<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> dollar<00:03:55.920> app

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that's pretty good still a dollar app

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.760 
that's pretty good still a dollar app
you<00:03:56.430> get<00:03:56.580> seventy<00:03:57.150> cents<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.020> if

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770
