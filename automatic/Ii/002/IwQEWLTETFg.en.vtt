00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
hey all your roller speed freaks out

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.039

list<00:00:14.929> again<00:00:15.230> I<00:00:15.440> had<00:00:16.279> last<00:00:16.460> week<00:00:16.700> I<00:00:16.820> blew<00:00:17.000> up<00:00:17.029> my

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
list again I had last week I blew up my

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.609 
list again I had last week I blew up my
differential<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.260> my<00:00:19.130> clutch<00:00:20.080> so<00:00:21.080> I<00:00:21.109> decided

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
differential and my clutch so I decided

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.620 
differential and my clutch so I decided
to<00:00:21.740> go<00:00:21.949> with<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.160> straight<00:00:23.060> axle<00:00:23.270> type

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
to go with a straight axle type

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.380 
to go with a straight axle type
differential<00:00:24.380> what<00:00:25.369> I<00:00:25.400> mean<00:00:25.580> by<00:00:25.699> that<00:00:25.730> is<00:00:26.029> if

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
differential what I mean by that is if

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.500 
differential what I mean by that is if
you<00:00:26.570> spin<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:26.930> tires<00:00:27.170> if<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:28.130> notice<00:00:28.510> both

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
you spin the tires if you notice both

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.240 
you spin the tires if you notice both
pairs<00:00:29.840> spin<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.230> same<00:00:30.439> way<00:00:32.920> this<00:00:33.920> will<00:00:34.100> allow

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
pairs spin the same way this will allow

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.150 
pairs spin the same way this will allow
the<00:00:34.309> vehicle<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:35.320> track<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.350> lot<00:00:36.590> better<00:00:36.890> at

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
the vehicle to track a lot better at

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.910 
the vehicle to track a lot better at
higher<00:00:37.700> speeds<00:00:38.120> more<00:00:38.450> trash<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.110> only

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
higher speeds more trash it only

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.369 
higher speeds more trash it only
drawback<00:00:40.489> is<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.090> turning<00:00:41.660> radius<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.200> lot

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
drawback is the turning radius is a lot

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.369 
drawback is the turning radius is a lot
wider<00:00:42.680> due<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.460> both<00:00:43.640> tires<00:00:44.140> spinning<00:00:45.140> at<00:00:45.350> the

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
wider due to both tires spinning at the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.209 
wider due to both tires spinning at the
same<00:00:45.800> rate<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.399> speed<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.690> if<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.320> want<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.070> do

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
same rate of speed so if you want to do

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.240 
same rate of speed so if you want to do
that<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:49.640> it's<00:00:49.760> pretty<00:00:49.910> easy<00:00:50.120> just<00:00:50.420> hit<00:00:50.840> me<00:00:50.960> up

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
that and it's pretty easy just hit me up

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.870 
that and it's pretty easy just hit me up
another<00:00:52.250> upgrade<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.059> did<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.449> my<00:00:54.670> my<00:00:55.670> axles

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.230 

P<00:00:59.270> steel<00:00:59.990> axles<00:01:00.940> there<00:01:01.940> are<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.060> lot<00:01:02.210> more

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
P steel axles there are a lot more

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.030 
P steel axles there are a lot more
beefier<00:01:02.840> now<00:01:03.080> hold<00:01:03.350> up<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.560> lot<00:01:03.710> more<00:01:03.890> to

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
beefier now hold up a lot more to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.570 
beefier now hold up a lot more to
crashes<00:01:04.630> hopefully<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.810> won't<00:01:05.930> happen<00:01:06.580> and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
crashes hopefully that won't happen and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.150 
crashes hopefully that won't happen and
this<00:01:07.730> is<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.300> old<00:01:08.450> myth<00:01:09.290> axles<00:01:09.800> I've<00:01:09.950> been

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
this is the old myth axles I've been

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.150 
this is the old myth axles I've been
using<00:01:10.930> nothing<00:01:11.930> wrong<00:01:12.230> with<00:01:12.380> them<00:01:12.590> they<00:01:12.950> held

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
using nothing wrong with them they held

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.580 
using nothing wrong with them they held
great<00:01:13.490> at<00:01:14.090> are<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:14.390> parts<00:01:14.870> I<00:01:14.960> decided<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.470> go

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
great at are all parts I decided to go

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.700 
great at are all parts I decided to go
with<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.150> bigger<00:01:17.150> actually<00:01:18.730> another<00:01:20.710> update

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
with that bigger actually another update

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.810 
with that bigger actually another update
I<00:01:21.950> did<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.370> uh<00:01:22.400> my<00:01:23.120> weight<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:24.310> made<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> custom

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
I did is uh my weight I made a custom

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.690 
I did is uh my weight I made a custom
weight<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:28.430> really<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:30.040> low<00:01:31.040> profile<00:01:31.550> as

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
weight and it's really a low profile as

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.499 
weight and it's really a low profile as
you<00:01:31.790> can<00:01:31.910> see<00:01:32.090> there<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:37.340> fits<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.000> upper

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
you can see there it fits on the upper

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.590 
you can see there it fits on the upper
chassis<00:01:38.930> for<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.170> low<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:40.610> husband<00:01:41.420> pretty

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
chassis for the low and a husband pretty

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.100 
chassis for the low and a husband pretty
good<00:01:41.869> that's<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.650> one<00:01:43.220> count<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.700> quarter<00:01:44.110> and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
good that's a one count in a quarter and

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.590 
good that's a one count in a quarter and
I<00:01:45.229> bolted<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.740> down<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:47.240> can<00:01:47.360> see<00:01:47.600> there<00:01:49.600> okay

how<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.940> works<00:02:08.119> out<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.869> give<00:02:08.990> an

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
how that works out just to give an

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.440 
how that works out just to give an
example<00:02:10.240> how<00:02:11.240> big<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.630> here's<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:13.450> don't

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
example how big it is here's a I don't

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.330 
example how big it is here's a I don't
want<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.660> see<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.140> let<00:02:15.290> me<00:02:15.319> see<00:02:20.860> okay<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.160> can

want to see that let me see okay you can
see<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.610> numbers<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.239> but<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.540> a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
see the numbers on there but this is a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.590 
see the numbers on there but this is a
32<00:02:24.590> opinion<00:02:25.930> okay<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.170> said<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.100> used<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.430> run<00:02:28.700> I'm

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
32 opinion okay I said I used to run I'm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600 
32 opinion okay I said I used to run I'm
going<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.780> put<00:02:29.930> up<00:02:29.959> against<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.590> opinion<00:02:31.250> item

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
going to put up against the opinion item

going to put up against the opinion item
now<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.739> see<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.950> difference<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.459> size

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
now you can see the difference in size

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.350 
now you can see the difference in size
what<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.040> big<00:02:37.220> difference<00:02:37.250> ain't<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:40.360> simple

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
what a big difference ain't it a simple

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.540 
what a big difference ain't it a simple
way<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.510> make<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.410> thing<00:02:42.470> work<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:43.280> hit<00:02:43.430> me

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
way to make this thing work just hit me

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.729 
way to make this thing work just hit me
up<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.880> I'll<00:02:43.940> tell<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.450> do<00:02:44.989> we<00:02:45.110> had<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.290> do

up and I'll tell you you do we had to do
this<00:02:45.920> pinion<00:02:46.670> gear<00:02:47.000> thing<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:48.470> actually<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
this pinion gear thing it's actually a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.550 
this pinion gear thing it's actually a
spur<00:02:49.160> gear<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.510> made<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.930> made<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.380> work

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
spur gear and I made it made it work

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.250 
spur gear and I made it made it work
into<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.860> pinion<00:02:52.280> gear<00:02:53.560> as<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.680> can<00:02:54.830> see<00:02:56.260> it's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
into a pinion gear as you can see it's

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.920 
into a pinion gear as you can see it's
not<00:02:57.620> good<00:02:57.950> but<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.400> could<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.300> same<00:03:02.540> way

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
not good but you could it's the same way

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.930
