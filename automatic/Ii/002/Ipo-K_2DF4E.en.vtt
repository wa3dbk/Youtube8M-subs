okay<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.290> tutorial<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.860> just<00:00:01.979> gonna

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
okay in this tutorial we're just gonna

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.830 
okay in this tutorial we're just gonna
take<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.370> look<00:00:02.610> at<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.850> lights<00:00:03.090> again<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.480> little

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
take a look at the lights again a little

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.570 
take a look at the lights again a little
bit<00:00:03.959> longer<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.589> we're<00:00:04.890> gonna<00:00:04.980> look<00:00:05.160> at<00:00:05.339> a

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
bit longer and we're gonna look at a

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.740 
bit longer and we're gonna look at a
couple<00:00:06.210> lights

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
couple lights

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.690 
couple lights
besides<00:00:07.589> these<00:00:07.799> point<00:00:08.189> lights<00:00:08.400> have<00:00:08.670> been

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
besides these point lights have been

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.520 
besides these point lights have been
using<00:00:09.059> point<00:00:09.420> lights<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.110> previous

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
using point lights from the previous

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.499 
using point lights from the previous
lesson<00:00:10.740> where<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.099> wanted<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.460> nice<00:00:11.670> local<00:00:12.059> light

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
lesson where I wanted a nice local light

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.079 
lesson where I wanted a nice local light
up<00:00:12.690> close<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.830> illuminate<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.519> scene<00:00:14.730> let's

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
up close to illuminate the scene let's

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.230 
up close to illuminate the scene let's
see<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.480> see<00:00:16.350> where<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.240> this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
see if we can see where this one is this

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660 
see if we can see where this one is this
has<00:00:18.710> yeah<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.279> isn't<00:00:20.460> even

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
has yeah I see this isn't even

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
has yeah I see this isn't even
illuminating<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> sphere<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.869> life<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
illuminating the sphere of life from the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.450 
illuminating the sphere of life from the
previous<00:00:22.680> lesson<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.279> see

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
previous lesson because you can see

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.189 
previous lesson because you can see
where<00:00:23.609> its<00:00:23.730> influence<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:24.930> based

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
where its influence is right here based

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.380 
where its influence is right here based
on<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.650> spherical<00:00:26.550> distance<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
on this spherical distance that I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.880 
on this spherical distance that I
haven't<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.990> turn<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> off<00:00:28.470> you'll<00:00:28.680> see

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
haven't see if I turn it off you'll see

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429 
haven't see if I turn it off you'll see
the<00:00:29.039> influence<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.289> also

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the influence there but I can also

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.880 
the influence there but I can also
change<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.649> great

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
change it like there it's a great

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
change it like there it's a great
technique<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.880> technique<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> really

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
technique and this technique is really

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
technique and this technique is really
great<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.230> down<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.710> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> base

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
great you can see down here at the base

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.850 
great you can see down here at the base
it<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.030> blend<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> render<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.410> had<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> hard

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it was blend to render it had a hard

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
it was blend to render it had a hard
time<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:41.969> shadows<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
time with you know shadows because it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.290 
time with you know shadows because it
wasn't<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:44.160> reflecting<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> light<00:00:45.149> off

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
wasn't really reflecting the light off

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
wasn't really reflecting the light off
of<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.660> bouncing<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> back<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
of here and bouncing it back up into the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
of here and bouncing it back up into the
scene<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> change<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
scene like this but you can change that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
scene like this but you can change that
on<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.110> own<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:49.680> putting<00:00:50.430> let's<00:00:51.149> see

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
on your own just by putting let's see

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
on your own just by putting let's see
let's<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:52.039> camera<00:00:53.039> view<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:54.710> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
let's get our camera view like that and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
let's get our camera view like that and
maybe<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> move<00:00:56.610> my<00:00:56.640> light<00:00:57.239> down<00:00:57.570> here

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
maybe I want to move my light down here

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.529 
maybe I want to move my light down here
in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> scene<00:00:59.120> maybe<00:01:00.120> I'll<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.449> put<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
in the scene maybe I'll just put a

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.460 
in the scene maybe I'll just put a
little<00:01:03.539> purple<00:01:03.899> light<00:01:04.400> maybe<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> dark<00:01:05.820> purple

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
little purple light maybe a dark purple

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
little purple light maybe a dark purple
you<00:01:07.470> know<00:01:07.530> those<00:01:07.710> dark<00:01:08.100> purples<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:08.820> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you know those dark purples down in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.780 
you know those dark purples down in
shadows<00:01:09.510> blueish<00:01:10.320> cold<00:01:10.650> colors<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
shadows blueish cold colors like that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
shadows blueish cold colors like that
and<00:01:12.090> there's<00:01:12.450> my<00:01:12.659> circle<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.110> influence<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and there's my circle of influence so

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.039 
and there's my circle of influence so
then<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> render<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.840> actually

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
then when I render it then I'm actually

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.740 
then when I render it then I'm actually
seeing<00:01:16.530> some<00:01:16.920> some<00:01:17.580> light<00:01:17.790> bouncing<00:01:18.570> like

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
seeing some some light bouncing like

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.270 
seeing some some light bouncing like
that<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.530> might<00:01:19.710> put<00:01:19.890> another<00:01:20.070> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that and then I might put another one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.539 
that and then I might put another one
there<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.220> lot

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
there so you kind of have to use a lot

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
there so you kind of have to use a lot
of<00:01:23.729> lights<00:01:23.939> within<00:01:24.509> blender<00:01:25.110> render<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
of lights within blender render if you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380 
of lights within blender render if you
want<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> try<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.250> simulate<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.729> realistic

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
want to try and simulate a realistic

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
want to try and simulate a realistic
effect<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> paint<00:01:28.740> type

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
effect but if you like to paint type

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
effect but if you like to paint type
things<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.869> cool<00:01:31.170> stuff

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
things you can do some really cool stuff

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.429 
things you can do some really cool stuff
with<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.400> blender<00:01:32.759> render<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.290> can

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
with in blender render and then you can

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.539 
with in blender render and then you can
also<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.890> within<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> game<00:01:35.340> engine

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
also do it within the game engine

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
also do it within the game engine
because<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:35.970> can't<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.329> cycles<00:01:36.720> within<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
because you can't do cycles within the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
because you can't do cycles within the
game<00:01:37.290> engine<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.340> has<00:01:38.520> its<00:01:38.729> advantages<00:01:39.329> as

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
game engine so it has its advantages as

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.950 
game engine so it has its advantages as
well<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.650> sure<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.130> suppose<00:01:41.850> another<00:01:42.540> thing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
well for sure I suppose another thing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
well for sure I suppose another thing
let's<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> look<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:44.009> where<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
let's take a look at is where is this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.330 
let's take a look at is where is this
light<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.590> point<00:01:46.920> light<00:01:47.130> let's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
light up there at that point light let's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
light up there at that point light let's
turn<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> point<00:01:48.030> light<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> spotlight

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
turn that point light into a spotlight

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.429 
turn that point light into a spotlight
and<00:01:49.640> spotlights<00:01:50.640> were<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> ones<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.570> for

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and spotlights were the ones that for

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.690 
and spotlights were the ones that for
years<00:01:52.710> were<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> only<00:01:53.040> ones<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.340> cast

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
years were the only ones that cast

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.959 
years were the only ones that cast
shadows<00:01:54.210> within<00:01:55.250> blender<00:01:56.250> render<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
shadows within blender render like that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.560 
shadows within blender render like that
again<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.079> set<00:01:58.350> over<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.829> and

I've pressed down here your shading has

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.490 
I've pressed down here your shading has
to<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.939> set<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.270> GLSL<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> see

nice things and if you have hard edges
sometimes<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.270> get<00:03:09.390> hard<00:03:09.600> edges<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:10.050> these

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
sometimes you get hard edges on these

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.050 
sometimes you get hard edges on these
spots<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.010> same<00:03:11.520> thing<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.850> use<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
spots but the same thing you use a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.790 
spots but the same thing you use a
little<00:03:12.360> point<00:03:12.630> light<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:13.020> low<00:03:13.260> intensity

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
little point light with low intensity

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.270 
little point light with low intensity
change<00:03:14.790> these<00:03:15.060> values<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:16.170> here<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:17.160> can

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
change these values in here and you can

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.890 
change these values in here and you can
kind<00:03:17.490> of<00:03:17.640> soften<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.090> whole<00:03:18.330> thing<00:03:18.570> up<00:03:18.690> like

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
kind of soften that whole thing up like
