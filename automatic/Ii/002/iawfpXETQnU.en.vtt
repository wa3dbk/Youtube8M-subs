00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:13.650
 It is Shokugan Kamen Rider Drive kit Yes 1 piece for 300 yen All 4 types 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 Most of Maher driver Ride Ride Well No. 4 the heart of the third was thorough HayashiOsamu to this sound 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.940
 Chaser 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.020
 Moreover, the 3rd and 4th are united properly 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.710
 Transform into a ride clother 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.420
 This time, the First of the best at it is Maha also associated with four types 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.420
 Well haha driver flames Reeve 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:43.570
 Outside the box Innovation'll open So it looks like this 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:46.780
 Yes and then 2 belts and 2 runners 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.760
 And one more part c Lowa 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.940
 I will make it there 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:59.089
 It seems to be easy to make with less parts this time 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:03.350
 I will put some parts on the driver body in a while. 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:09.560
 Click and fuck in the body bust 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.750
 Plug in the parts from the back, and it's also on the front side 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 Five 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:20.250
 Insert the part of the example into the signal bike bra too 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:26.610
 After setting the belts on the side as usual, the parts are fixed and the parts are inset. 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.869
 First of all, the belt parts for which the pachi group is completed are always passed through this black string together 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.770
 Because it is the end 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.000
 Well this is this time 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.620
 Omit it Let's paste a seal First signal Mach 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 It is a feeling to put in a detailed place unexpectedly 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:48.340
 It's hard to come by 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.650
 And Kurumatan seal of after-Fire part and the muffler parts to Okkei belt body 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:58.610
 Put on a little intern 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:03.590
 Looks good person who was put before Crossed really part is a good kana Petatsu those who ordered 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:08.660
 Yes, I will remove it once and put a sticker on it. 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.800
 Because the shape of the belt itself is this Marha driver has changed 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.800
 It is a feeling that I put it in the place where I got a great rattle 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.630
 This probably quite difficult 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.170
 It's very empty this time 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.300
 It's really spring when it comes to spring 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.420
 It is hard to paste Absolutely it is better to have a Shiloh point 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.070
 Kansai Mach driver fire is a little bit yes 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:40.580
 It came out 15 questions in total since we were takes about 10 minutes struggling to seal upholstery 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:47.290
 And once I try my best for 300 yen 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:52.560
 Well after seeing the deluxe wah there is a certain difference 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.480
 Something little I race driver I was working hard in the fine 300 yen a year ago Candy Toys 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:02.409
 Well , even if it is said that a driver 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:06.970
 Hmmm Tech House Yes The whole is like this 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.280
 The back is a one minute minced upper side wow 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.680
 So 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.300
 The gimmick slides up but it goes up a bit, so here's a signal bike 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.420
 Can be put 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.950
 Properly to go up is into place and lock 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.480
 If you lower it 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.660
 Let's set the In and 6 signal Baiko at Starbucks 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.270
 Lock When you plug dx to Saturday back 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.410
 And so to reduce 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:38.510
 Yes r mark goes to the front like this 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:44.090
 Considerably and it will set the state switch part of the above I will Maha driver Poku is 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:47.630
 Gimmick is only with Darcy on the signal bike because I do not particularly 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.260
 Set put in and will often out pull 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.970
 Besides the signal mark 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.720
 May shift mother of the same Shokugan series enter 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.629
 Set the shift car instead of Shibuya bike 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:08.819
 Don't worry, if you lower your chat, you will fall in love with you 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.280
 We also put on the shave of the sea ​​tube in the shift brace . 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:16.209
 Properly 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:21.799
 It is compatible, but just playing a little , the sticker starts to come off 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:27.740
 It may be easy to turn off because I put a sticker in a strange place 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:34.280
 I do not have a tire rotation gimmick by this size difference compared with i deluxe version 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.030
 There are many black parts in the deluxe version when you look like this when comparing the belt body 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.060
 Right 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:43.650
 I feel like the difference is open 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.790
 Introduced the drive kit's First Maher driver flame by means saying yes 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.810
 Well I personally I'd say you are working hard to 300 yen split 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.900
 Hmmm 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:59.550
 I think it was good work interlocking with the shift mother of the same Shokugan series 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.150
