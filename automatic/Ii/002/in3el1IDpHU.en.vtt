00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.329 

I<00:00:02.330> know<00:00:03.330> for<00:00:03.600> most<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.929> us<00:00:04.080> motivation<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.100> one

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
I know for most of us motivation is one

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.430 
I know for most of us motivation is one
of<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.549> things<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.629> spend<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.109> lot<00:00:07.140> of

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
of the things that we we spend a lot of

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.690 
of the things that we we spend a lot of
time<00:00:07.589> trying<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.950> figure<00:00:08.130> out<00:00:08.370> how<00:00:08.639> to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
time trying to figure out how to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.030 
time trying to figure out how to
effectively<00:00:09.269> motivate<00:00:10.050> our<00:00:10.290> team<00:00:10.620> members

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
effectively motivate our team members

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.100 
effectively motivate our team members
and<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> wanted<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> spend<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:12.840> four

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
and so I wanted to spend about four

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.810 
and so I wanted to spend about four
minutes<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:13.860> share<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.519> fact

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
minutes and just share with you the fact

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.980 
minutes and just share with you the fact
that<00:00:15.059> there's<00:00:15.240> actually<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:15.960> different

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that there's actually two different

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.310 
that there's actually two different
types<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.949> motivators<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.150> there<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.170> I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
types of motivators out there and I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.720 
types of motivators out there and I
think<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.710> most<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.400> us<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.539> type

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
think that most of us use one type

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.300 
think that most of us use one type
probably<00:00:23.730> 90<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.359> 95<00:00:24.869> percent<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:26.039> really

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
probably 90 to 95 percent and we really

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
probably 90 to 95 percent and we really
haven't<00:00:26.490> figured<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.029> how<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> harness<00:00:27.570> that

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
haven't figured out how to harness that

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529 
haven't figured out how to harness that
other<00:00:28.289> type<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> motivator<00:00:29.730> yet<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.359> just

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
other type of motivator yet so I just

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
other type of motivator yet so I just
wanted<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.080> share<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.009> two

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
wanted to share with you what these two

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.560 
wanted to share with you what these two
motivators<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:34.670> intrinsic<00:00:35.670> motivation<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
motivators are intrinsic motivation and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.910 
motivators are intrinsic motivation and
extrinsic<00:00:37.610> motivation<00:00:39.920> extrinsic

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
extrinsic motivation extrinsic

extrinsic motivation extrinsic
motivation<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> probably<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> most<00:00:42.480> common

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
motivation is probably the most common

you've ever worked in a sales

motivators<00:01:02.600> intrinsic<00:01:03.600> motivation<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
motivators intrinsic motivation is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
motivators intrinsic motivation is
motivators<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.520> internal

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
motivators that are really internal

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.210 
motivators that are really internal
factors<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.290> you've<00:01:10.439> ever<00:01:10.590> had<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> hobby

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
factors so if you've ever had a hobby

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
factors so if you've ever had a hobby
for<00:01:11.430> example<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.900> something<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
for example that would be something that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.090 
for example that would be something that
you're<00:01:13.470> motivated<00:01:13.740> intrinsically<00:01:14.580> by<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.860> do

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you're motivated intrinsically by you do

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
you're motivated intrinsically by you do
it<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:18.180> fun<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it because it's fun for you to do the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.520 
it because it's fun for you to do the
act<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.890> doing<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.460> fun<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.990> enjoy<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
act of doing it is fun you enjoy the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.600 
act of doing it is fun you enjoy the
process<00:01:22.830> rather<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> outcome<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> which

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
process rather than the outcome so which

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.179 
process rather than the outcome so which
one's<00:01:26.850> better

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
one's better

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.950 
one's better
intrinsic<00:01:29.189> motivation<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> much<00:01:30.420> stronger

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
intrinsic motivation is a much stronger

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
intrinsic motivation is a much stronger
motivator<00:01:33.439> we<00:01:34.439> tend<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:35.369> intrinsically

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
motivator we tend to be intrinsically

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
motivator we tend to be intrinsically
motivated<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:37.860> thing<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
motivated because it's a good thing to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.740 
motivated because it's a good thing to
do<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:39.750> enjoyable<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.450> thing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
do it's enjoyable it's the right thing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.120 
do it's enjoyable it's the right thing
to<00:01:42.869> do

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.410 

extrinsic<00:01:46.700> motivation<00:01:47.830> can<00:01:48.830> displace

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
extrinsic motivation can displace

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.120 
extrinsic motivation can displace
intrinsic<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:50.840> what<00:01:51.229> I<00:01:51.259> mean<00:01:51.500> by<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:51.710> is

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
intrinsic and and what I mean by that is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.930 
intrinsic and and what I mean by that is
simply<00:01:53.020> even<00:01:54.020> though<00:01:54.280> intrinsic<00:01:55.280> motivators

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
simply even though intrinsic motivators

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.070 
simply even though intrinsic motivators
are<00:01:56.150> stronger<00:01:56.869> long-term<00:01:57.940> extrinsic

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
are stronger long-term extrinsic

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080 
are stronger long-term extrinsic
motivators<00:02:00.080> are<00:02:00.680> stronger<00:02:01.220> short-term<00:02:01.729> so

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
motivators are stronger short-term so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.680 
motivators are stronger short-term so
you<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:02.810> easily<00:02:03.020> displace<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:04.570> motivator<00:02:05.570> that

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
you can easily displace a motivator that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.940 
you can easily displace a motivator that
is<00:02:06.549> intrinsic<00:02:07.549> by<00:02:08.479> offering<00:02:09.080> somebody<00:02:09.500> say<00:02:09.920> a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
is intrinsic by offering somebody say a

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.100 
is intrinsic by offering somebody say a
lot<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.550> money<00:02:10.880> for<00:02:11.420> example<00:02:14.110> extrinsic

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
lot of money for example extrinsic

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.040 
lot of money for example extrinsic
motivators<00:02:15.800> really<00:02:16.730> provide<00:02:17.390> immediate

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
motivators really provide immediate

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.990 
motivators really provide immediate
satisfaction<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.340> something<00:02:19.850> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
satisfaction so you do something and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.229 
satisfaction so you do something and
then<00:02:20.450> there's<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.750> result<00:02:21.319> for<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:22.239> something

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
then there's a result for that something

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.300 
then there's a result for that something
like<00:02:23.360> money<00:02:23.690> for<00:02:23.959> example<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.280> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
like money for example it is a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.910 
like money for example it is a
short-term<00:02:25.910> satisfaction<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.650> thing<00:02:27.800> to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
short-term satisfaction and the thing to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.100 
short-term satisfaction and the thing to
keep<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.190> mind<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.760> extrinsic<00:02:29.540> motivators

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
keep in mind with extrinsic motivators

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.280 
keep in mind with extrinsic motivators
is<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:31.100> rely<00:02:31.580> on<00:02:31.610> continual<00:02:32.540> feeding<00:02:32.989> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
is they rely on continual feeding so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.380 
is they rely on continual feeding so
obviously<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.640> provide<00:02:35.150> those

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
obviously you have to provide those

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.210 
obviously you have to provide those
external<00:02:36.220> sources<00:02:37.220> on<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.819> regular<00:02:38.330> basis<00:02:39.220> so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
external sources on a regular basis so

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.039 
external sources on a regular basis so
just<00:02:40.400> some<00:02:40.549> things<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.850> think<00:02:40.940> about<00:02:41.209> what

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
just some things to think about what

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.140 
just some things to think about what
happens<00:02:42.410> when<00:02:42.530> extrinsic<00:02:43.250> motivators<00:02:43.910> go

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
happens when extrinsic motivators go

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.880 
happens when extrinsic motivators go
away<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.840> that's<00:02:45.049> that's<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.470> big<00:02:45.709> issue

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
away and that's that's a big issue

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.740 
away and that's that's a big issue
actually<00:02:46.850> why<00:02:47.299> we<00:02:48.049> have<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> balance

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
actually why we have to balance

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.479 
actually why we have to balance
intrinsic<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.959> extrinsic<00:02:51.280> motivators<00:02:52.280> I

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
intrinsic and extrinsic motivators I

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.800 
intrinsic and extrinsic motivators I
know<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.239> in<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.630> call<00:02:53.959> center<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:54.530> used<00:02:54.709> to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
know that in a call center we used to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.039 
know that in a call center we used to
provide<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> an<00:02:57.200> incentive<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.010> bonus<00:02:58.549> for<00:02:59.329> every

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
provide a an incentive a bonus for every

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.470 
provide a an incentive a bonus for every
30<00:03:00.650> days<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.190> an<00:03:01.370> agent<00:03:01.760> would<00:03:01.940> go<00:03:02.150> without

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
30 days that an agent would go without

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.890 
30 days that an agent would go without
calling<00:03:02.989> off<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.650> or<00:03:04.220> being<00:03:04.549> late<00:03:04.790> they<00:03:05.750> would

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
calling off and or being late they would

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.259 
calling off and or being late they would
get<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.079> certain<00:03:06.470> dollar<00:03:06.680> amount<00:03:06.859> bonus<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.090> at

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
get a certain dollar amount bonus and at

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.759 
get a certain dollar amount bonus and at
some<00:03:08.480> point<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.810> had<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.019> do<00:03:09.230> away<00:03:09.350> with<00:03:09.530> that

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
some point we had to do away with that

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.509 
some point we had to do away with that
and<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.870> was<00:03:12.019> amazing<00:03:12.560> what<00:03:12.709> happened<00:03:13.220> when<00:03:13.370> we

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
and it was amazing what happened when we

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.940 
and it was amazing what happened when we
took<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.850> away<00:03:14.170> people<00:03:15.170> were<00:03:15.260> very<00:03:15.470> upset

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
took that away people were very upset

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.569 
took that away people were very upset
and<00:03:16.160> they<00:03:16.310> really<00:03:16.880> ended<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.209> looking<00:03:17.480> at<00:03:17.840> that

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
and they really ended up looking at that

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.759 
and they really ended up looking at that
bonus<00:03:19.579> as<00:03:19.970> part<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.540> their<00:03:20.720> standardized<00:03:21.350> pay

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
bonus as part of their standardized pay

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.660 
bonus as part of their standardized pay
and<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.570> became<00:03:24.100> something<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.280> they

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
and so it became something that they

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.000 
and so it became something that they
expected<00:03:26.600> rather<00:03:27.170> than<00:03:27.440> something<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.799> they

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
expected rather than something that they

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.900 
expected rather than something that they
were<00:03:28.070> motivated<00:03:28.820> by<00:03:30.400> extrinsic<00:03:31.400> motivators

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
were motivated by extrinsic motivators

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.060 
were motivated by extrinsic motivators
can<00:03:32.299> reduce<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.840> effectiveness<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
can reduce the effectiveness of

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.569 
can reduce the effectiveness of
intrinsic<00:03:34.690> motivators<00:03:35.690> long-term<00:03:36.260> we<00:03:37.130> become

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
intrinsic motivators long-term we become

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.680 
intrinsic motivators long-term we become
addicted<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.359> in<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.230> sense<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:40.690> external

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
addicted to in a sense these external

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.770 
addicted to in a sense these external
motivators<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.790> becomes<00:03:44.090> hard<00:03:44.390> for<00:03:44.450> us<00:03:44.630> to

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
motivators and it becomes hard for us to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.630 
motivators and it becomes hard for us to
kind<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:44.989> go<00:03:45.109> back<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.350> be<00:03:46.100> motivated

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
kind of go back and be motivated

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.430 
kind of go back and be motivated
intrinsically

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
intrinsically

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.400 
intrinsically
and<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:50.120> level<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.480> dedication<00:03:50.660> and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
and the level of dedication and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.220 
and the level of dedication and
creativity<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.310> actually<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.640> lot<00:03:52.820> higher<00:03:53.230> when

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
creativity is actually a lot higher when

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.950 
creativity is actually a lot higher when
someone's<00:03:54.680> intrinsically<00:03:55.460> motivated<00:03:56.240> so<00:03:56.900> you

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
someone's intrinsically motivated so you

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.610 
someone's intrinsically motivated so you
get<00:03:57.140> better<00:03:57.380> results<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.870> that's<00:04:00.170> really<00:04:00.350> it

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
get better results so I that's really it

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.290 
get better results so I that's really it
it<00:04:00.740> was<00:04:00.830> very<00:04:00.860> short<00:04:01.370> but<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.640> just<00:04:01.940> wanted<00:04:02.180> to

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
it was very short but I just wanted to

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.700 
it was very short but I just wanted to
share<00:04:02.480> with<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.960> fact<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.410> there<00:04:03.560> are

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
share with you the fact that there are

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.820 
share with you the fact that there are
two<00:04:03.980> different<00:04:04.340> types<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.880> motivators<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.840> I

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
two different types of motivators and I

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.240 
two different types of motivators and I
know<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.280> most<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.820> you<00:04:07.910> are<00:04:08.180> probably<00:04:08.360> using

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
know that most of you are probably using

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.030 
know that most of you are probably using
the<00:04:10.250> external<00:04:11.000> motivators<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:12.290> use<00:04:12.800> those

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
the external motivators but use those

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.850 
the external motivators but use those
with<00:04:13.310> caution<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.300> try<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.110> balance<00:04:15.440> those

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
with caution and try to balance those

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.250 
with caution and try to balance those
effectively<00:04:16.430> with<00:04:16.790> with<00:04:17.269> intrinsic

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
effectively with with intrinsic

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.660 
effectively with with intrinsic
motivators<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:18.860> you<00:04:19.100> can<00:04:19.250> do<00:04:19.370> some<00:04:19.549> more

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
motivators and you can do some more

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.160 
motivators and you can do some more
research<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.239> what<00:04:20.510> would<00:04:20.660> be<00:04:20.840> some<00:04:21.049> examples

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
research on what would be some examples

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.730 
research on what would be some examples
of<00:04:21.860> ways<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.850> intrinsically<00:04:23.480> motivate<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.380> we

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
of ways to intrinsically motivate and we

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.440 
of ways to intrinsically motivate and we
may<00:04:24.890> do<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.070> session<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.820> future<00:04:26.150> on<00:04:26.270> that

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
may do a session in the future on that

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.210 
may do a session in the future on that
but<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.990> just<00:04:27.170> wanted<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.650> be<00:04:27.770> aware<00:04:28.160> that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
but I just wanted you to be aware that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.950 
but I just wanted you to be aware that
there<00:04:28.520> are<00:04:28.550> actually<00:04:29.180> two<00:04:29.360> different<00:04:29.390> types

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
there are actually two different types

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.140 
there are actually two different types
so<00:04:30.290> I<00:04:30.530> hope<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:30.980> found<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.280> helpful<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.970> I

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
so I hope you found that helpful and I

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.900 
so I hope you found that helpful and I
hope<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.390> have<00:04:32.480> a<00:04:32.540> great<00:04:32.750> day
