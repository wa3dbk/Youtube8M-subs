tried<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.959> creating<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.530> world<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
tried the creating a world in the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.400 
tried the creating a world in the
workshop<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:36.600> sure<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.080> would<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
workshop so I'm sure that would make it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.130 
workshop so I'm sure that would make it
even<00:02:37.560> more<00:02:37.740> fantastic<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.930> could

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
even more fantastic as you could

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.560 
even more fantastic as you could
actually<00:02:40.520> create<00:02:41.520> your<00:02:41.820> own<00:02:41.850> worlds<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:42.480> you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
actually create your own worlds if you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.699 
actually create your own worlds if you
didn't<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> ones<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.470> were<00:02:43.530> already

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
didn't like the ones that were already

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.530 
didn't like the ones that were already
pre-made<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:46.050> Star<00:02:46.470> doc<00:02:46.709> apparently<00:02:47.420> they<00:02:48.420> had

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540

course<00:03:32.489> we're<00:03:32.940> off<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.299> really<00:03:33.390> bad<00:03:33.720> start

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
course we're off to a really bad start

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.890 
course we're off to a really bad start
already<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.970> course<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.510> know<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:36.690> didn't

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
already of course you know you didn't

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.259 
already of course you know you didn't
die<00:03:36.989> yet<00:03:37.170> okay<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> can't<00:03:38.010> remember<00:03:38.250> okay<00:03:39.030> one

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.140 
die yet okay I can't remember okay one
of<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.480> powers<00:03:39.810> he<00:03:39.989> has<00:03:40.110> his<00:03:40.290> shockwave<00:03:41.150> it

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
of the powers he has his shockwave it

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.990 
of the powers he has his shockwave it
actually<00:03:42.600> damaged<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:44.010> damages<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.700> units

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
actually damaged it damages the units

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.400 
actually damaged it damages the units
around<00:03:45.209> him<00:03:45.450> which<00:03:45.600> I'm<00:03:45.750> pretty<00:03:45.900> sure<00:03:46.019> will

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
around him which I'm pretty sure will

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.470 
around him which I'm pretty sure will
actually<00:03:46.829> kill<00:03:47.040> him<00:03:47.250> or<00:03:47.549> kill<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> enemy<00:03:48.269> and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
actually kill him or kill the enemy and

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.780 
actually kill him or kill the enemy and
yes<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.230> did<00:03:49.380> if<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.860> wasn't<00:03:50.160> for<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.310> spell

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
yes it did if it wasn't for that spell

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.819 
yes it did if it wasn't for that spell
he<00:03:51.390> would<00:03:51.510> not<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.810> won<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.170> battle<00:03:52.350> my

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
he would not have won that battle my

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.170 
he would not have won that battle my
main<00:03:53.010> character<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.519> could<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.880> his<00:03:54.000> name

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
main character as you could see his name

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.699 
main character as you could see his name
was<00:03:54.329> Gandalf<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.049> course<00:03:55.230> he<00:03:55.320> looks<00:03:55.530> like

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
was Gandalf and of course he looks like

he just won that battle by a very small

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.280 
he just won that battle by a very small
margin<00:03:59.459> if<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.060> weren't<00:04:00.209> for<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.390> spell<00:04:01.079> he

wouldn't have won those of you who are
new<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.570> game<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.959> course<00:04:04.110> those<00:04:04.440> spells<00:04:04.739> I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
new to the game of course those spells I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.890 
new to the game of course those spells I
just<00:04:05.340> used<00:04:05.640> up<00:04:06.120> here<00:04:06.420> if<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.600> look<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
just used up here if you look in the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.949 
just used up here if you look in the
corner<00:04:07.140> mana<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.950> have<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.459> that

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
corner mana you have to have that

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.819 
corner mana you have to have that
depending<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.079> cities<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.769> these

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
depending on the cities and these

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.460 
depending on the cities and these
different<00:04:11.280> shards<00:04:11.850> they<00:04:12.570> provide<00:04:13.019> power<00:04:13.320> for

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
different shards they provide power for

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.219 
different shards they provide power for
you<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.100> per<00:04:14.940> turn<00:04:15.180> right<00:04:15.420> now<00:04:15.540> I'm<00:04:15.660> making<00:04:15.780> 9

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
you and per turn right now I'm making 9

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.140 
you and per turn right now I'm making 9
per<00:04:16.500> turn<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:17.039> builds<00:04:17.400> up<00:04:17.489> over<00:04:17.640> time<00:04:17.789> of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
per turn that builds up over time of

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.000 
per turn that builds up over time of
course<00:04:18.180> what<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.630> could<00:04:18.780> see<00:04:18.959> there<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.769> took

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
course what you could see there it took

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.940 
course what you could see there it took
I<00:04:20.370> believe<00:04:20.940> 45<00:04:21.539> mana<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.229> actually<00:04:22.590> use<00:04:22.740> that

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
I believe 45 mana to actually use that

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.290 
I believe 45 mana to actually use that
power<00:04:23.160> so<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.580> know<00:04:23.760> if<00:04:23.850> he<00:04:23.910> didn't<00:04:24.150> have<00:04:24.270> that

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
power so you know if he didn't have that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.659 
power so you know if he didn't have that
power<00:04:24.599> he<00:04:24.870> would<00:04:25.050> be<00:04:25.169> pretty<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:25.590> screwed

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
power he would be pretty well screwed

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.640 
power he would be pretty well screwed
right<00:04:27.210> now<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.569> my<00:04:27.599> game<00:04:27.930> I'm<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.229> doing<00:04:28.499> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
right now in my game I'm not doing the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.709 
right now in my game I'm not doing the
greatest<00:04:29.069> I<00:04:29.280> don't<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:29.729> any<00:04:29.879> army<00:04:30.300> right<00:04:30.539> now

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
greatest I don't have any army right now

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.499 
greatest I don't have any army right now
of<00:04:31.379> course<00:04:31.439> I<00:04:31.860> have<00:04:31.889> my<00:04:32.759> other<00:04:32.939> little<00:04:33.150> village

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
of course I have my other little village

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:34.939 
of course I have my other little village
here<00:04:33.629> of<00:04:33.749> course<00:04:33.870> this<00:04:34.050> mines<00:04:34.590> kind<00:04:34.830> of

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
here of course this mines kind of

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.619 
here of course this mines kind of
representing<00:04:35.460> Lord<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.789> Rings<00:04:36.029> but<00:04:36.449> um

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 
representing Lord of the Rings but um

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.719 
representing Lord of the Rings but um
there's<00:04:37.529> a<00:04:37.620> lot<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.919> things<00:04:38.129> for<00:04:38.310> me<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.490> still

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
there's a lot of things for me to still

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.589 
there's a lot of things for me to still
learn<00:04:38.909> but<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.689> a<00:04:39.930> pretty<00:04:40.289> easy<00:04:41.090> platform<00:04:42.090> I

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
learn but it's a pretty easy platform I

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.570 
learn but it's a pretty easy platform I
think<00:04:42.629> anyone<00:04:43.169> could<00:04:43.409> easily<00:04:43.770> jump<00:04:44.249> into<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
think anyone could easily jump into the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.670 
think anyone could easily jump into the
game<00:04:44.789> and<00:04:45.060> get<00:04:45.240> started<00:04:45.509> another<00:04:46.319> thing<00:04:46.590> I

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
game and get started another thing I

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.529 
game and get started another thing I
really<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.099> is<00:04:47.129> one<00:04:47.849> of<00:04:47.939> your<00:04:48.090> completing

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
quests you actually pick up different

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.489 
quests you actually pick up different
items<00:04:50.999> as<00:04:51.300> your<00:04:51.479> research<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.139> get<00:04:52.319> new

items like this fire staff we did not

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.149 
items like this fire staff we did not
used<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.569> have<00:04:54.719> that<00:04:54.930> when<00:04:55.529> in<00:04:55.650> battle<00:04:56.009> he

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
used to have that when in battle he

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.860 
used to have that when in battle he

many things it's really a kind of a game

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.899 
many things it's really a kind of a game
a<00:06:12.289> personal<00:06:13.289> preference<00:06:13.529> because<00:06:14.399> it<00:06:14.639> all

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
a personal preference because it all

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.459 
a personal preference because it all
depends<00:06:15.449> like<00:06:15.539> when<00:06:15.719> your<00:06:15.839> character<00:06:16.020> levels

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
depends like when your character levels

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.260 
depends like when your character levels
up<00:06:16.649> you<00:06:17.129> choose<00:06:17.399> a<00:06:17.430> field<00:06:17.729> for<00:06:17.969> him<00:06:18.089> to<00:06:18.149> go

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
up you choose a field for him to go

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.610 
up you choose a field for him to go
forward<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:18.990> that<00:06:19.560> kind<00:06:19.949> of<00:06:20.009> depends<00:06:20.610> on<00:06:20.729> what

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
forward and that kind of depends on what

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.050 
forward and that kind of depends on what
how<00:06:22.620> you<00:06:22.649> created<00:06:23.219> your<00:06:23.279> character<00:06:23.550> and

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
how you created your character and

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.230 
how you created your character and
that'll<00:06:25.020> all<00:06:25.199> affect<00:06:25.620> what<00:06:26.310> abilities<00:06:26.969> they

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
that'll all affect what abilities they

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.619 
that'll all affect what abilities they
will<00:06:27.389> have<00:06:28.009> so<00:06:29.009> I<00:06:29.039> know<00:06:29.699> this<00:06:30.120> is<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.330> pretty

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
will have so I know this is a pretty

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.950 
will have so I know this is a pretty
short<00:06:31.520> review<00:06:32.520> but<00:06:33.270> hopefully<00:06:33.599> this<00:06:33.779> just

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
short review but hopefully this just

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.689 
short review but hopefully this just
kind<00:06:34.169> of<00:06:34.229> gives<00:06:34.289> you<00:06:34.560> an<00:06:34.649> idea<00:06:34.830> of<00:06:35.069> what<00:06:35.490> the

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
kind of gives you an idea of what the

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.029 
kind of gives you an idea of what the
in-game<00:06:36.060> interface<00:06:36.569> is<00:06:36.810> like

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
in-game interface is like

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.859 
in-game interface is like
on<00:06:38.279> it<00:06:38.430> and<00:06:38.460> show<00:06:38.699> a<00:06:38.729> lot<00:06:38.939> of<00:06:39.059> features<00:06:39.419> when

00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:39.869 
on it and show a lot of features when

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:41.299 
on it and show a lot of features when
you're<00:06:39.990> creating<00:06:40.199> characters<00:06:40.710> or<00:06:40.889> factions

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:41.309 
you're creating characters or factions
