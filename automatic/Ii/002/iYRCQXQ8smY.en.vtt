00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.509
 My food does not leave me 100%, because in my 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.389
 passion in person but daughter of aldo 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.119
 think differently 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.820
 I grew up under those rules and I did not 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.539
 It may be like that if I used butter 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.880
 less quality and so although more 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.740
 but no but if I do not care 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.930
 Chile 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.470
 how much being fair makes everything 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.050
 go well kitchen that is as human 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.100
 the one that ink or the poet that you wear 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.100
 you wear it 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.300
 whether the food is me, I do remember 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.060
 I scored goals she liked to give away 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.370
 food then if there was a gentleman who 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.830
 needed and is open such past hour 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.050
 nobody kept talking about it and if you 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.239
 son he wrote he had eaten for all and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.150
 always if we were us as 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.330
 there are eight or ten and for five people 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.699
 more because he said that there was always 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.910
 save just in case the son of 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.910
 God 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.950
 I was engaged before trade is done 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.270
 a loss and they went with enough with 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.060
 many thousand ten thousand dollars 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.250
 so I liked cooking at a 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 cousin who worked in a block she 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.930
 said cousin you think we can 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.910
 draw from lived friends and so from 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.040
 there started another company and another product 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.540
 in the camera that he deserved until 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.450
 we will get the rudder and between 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.510
 we need the banks all of us 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.220
 for dates that I do not repeat the least 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.600
 like that next month because there's 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.690
 million things to prepare on the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.509
 sentence they engage in the same thing I 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.149
 person goes and gave them for free and I 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.680
 gave 12 days to test with 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.350
 the head of agency 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.420
 then she tried and they accepted and so the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.800
 employees ate me english 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.320
 and to give this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.330
 when they played some every 15 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.210
 others per month depending as the payment 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.250
 with their economic situation I 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.680
 same had to go and for reasons of 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.350
 costs to save half walked I'll 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.220
 play because I have two children and I 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.410
 I played 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.970
 I had a man who had a 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.900
 good economic position but I do not 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.710
 I made my children or I happy 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.370
 I can take them forward 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.840
 I had to work toulouse and super hard 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.030
 because being a mom is a four-word word 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.180
 letters but it's super big 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.570
 responsibility then when I'm 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.740
 in the USA I also worked 20 hours a day 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.020
 the 24 after 18 after I go to 15 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.180
 because the gringos said they do not know 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.520
 can work a lot but I did not want 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.160
 make money to do this 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.020
 living apartment with my children here 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.850
 you get tired and because we are human 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.850
 so I never got tired that he has never 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.830
 cried not but then when 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.520
 things are going damme and your children are 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.410
 great you see your satisfactions and the 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.900
 things go through adam 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.060
 I always worked as a cashier myself 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.130
 flower arrangements are made in some 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.950
 moment I made shrimp ceviche and the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.070
 I sold, I lost my job and I give him a 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.190
 park where they would judge Ecuadorians 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.990
 and sold them clean apartments those 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.550
 things that nobody counts for that in the 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.320
 USA 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.150
 I worked on everything but always 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.970
 cleanly 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.950
 I was going to study the kitchen but 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.569
 the towers fell and I was 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.030
 tourist 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.099
 between meals and it was enabled and there 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.470
 the thing was terrible because season 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.180
 they go in zero and a half less oxygen me 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.069
 I go by my own feet before I 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.079
 catch immigration you when teams 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.790
 they are after the chips and I enrolled 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.939
 we make the songs decision effort 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.970
 own pension was not so cheap and I 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.800
 I graduated 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.560
 I always like the kitchen is 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.300
 little boy at age 8 I got into the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.010
 my grandmother's position because I 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.510
 I grew up with my grandparents 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.460
 I was also raised under the concepts 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.490
 of them and that has to be honest 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.220
 as the law of smoking or not you throw the 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.200
 boomerang and in a moment it bounces you if 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.650
 I am a bad service if in some 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.030
 moment me 4 to receive that is me 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.030
 I tried to be his promise 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.190
 and a lot 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.850
 it's like when they say they vote you to the river 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.850
 chubut attitude 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.930
 then we go my story you have to 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.930
 invent it see how you do it
