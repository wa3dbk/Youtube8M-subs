00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:14.299
 we are in rome paschal market ii a 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:19.170
 caravans gianna at the headland 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.970
 also stefano and now john c ci 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.140
 tells a little how to choose a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.640
 good melon then in this period of 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.260
 exceptional because there is a lot of sun 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 nice than anything anyway 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.149
 I repeat the sun the period of the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.620
 season and there are these here that are 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.640
 the dates that come from anyway 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.140
 maccarese and are good and are fresh and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 then there is this other than split that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 would be francesino always split though 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.629
 this time I feel hot and so on 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.760
 etc. it can be split but here it is 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.199
 it depends on all this when it is caught 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.000
 he leaves his arms from the object 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.260
 incamiciare wait at least once 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.660
 that is taken away here this is the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 just moderation that you see from this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 time that must be taken away then when 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.030
 it takes away means that I am old and mature 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 however, it is a very stable land 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.010
 for the melons of the council because they are 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.939
 really good 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.830
 now and this up until the month up 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.509
 at the end of August they are always 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.869
 exceptional then they begin to be po 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.820
 less good because the season ends 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.680
 taste difference there is difference between 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.530
 these two are both sweet like 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.020
 there is sweetness there is basket and the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.210
 right product on the right soil ie 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.240
 you must have the intuition to find the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 things where the cool stuff is where there is 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.100
 good land and this is all the secret but 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 it is true that the smell can be recognized 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.909
 corpse is not good but sometimes not 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.189
 it smells when you eat hostages 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.869
 feel the difference and then it must be 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.299
 very solid with I see myself another 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.579
 things must not be the same 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.710
 because the springs how many things with springs is 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.710
 better put in the bucket thanks
