you start with Japan which is very

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.210 
you start with Japan which is very
exciting<00:00:32.140> it's<00:00:32.439> very<00:00:32.529> interesting<00:00:33.070> about

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
exciting it's very interesting about

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.040 
exciting it's very interesting about
that<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.640> know<00:00:33.730> you<00:00:33.760> can<00:00:34.090> put<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.450> neutral

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
that you know you can put a neutral

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.040 
that you know you can put a neutral
force<00:00:35.380> which<00:00:35.649> is<00:00:35.770> very<00:00:35.950> powerful<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:37.050> benefit

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
force which is very powerful to benefit

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.480 
force which is very powerful to benefit
people<00:00:38.200> to<00:00:38.440> bring<00:00:38.620> people<00:00:38.920> together<00:00:39.040> and<00:00:39.370> I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
people to bring people together and I

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.370 
people to bring people together and I
think<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.820> two<00:00:39.970> major<00:00:40.240> neutral<00:00:40.720> forces<00:00:41.140> are

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
think the two major neutral forces are

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.400 
think the two major neutral forces are
music<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:42.280> food<00:00:42.790> mmm<00:00:43.540> which<00:00:43.990> every<00:00:44.380> human
