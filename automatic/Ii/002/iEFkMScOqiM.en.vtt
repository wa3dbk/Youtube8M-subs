00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
my adjustment now the way I'm adjusting

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.529 
my adjustment now the way I'm adjusting
this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:43.070> I'm<00:00:44.070> using<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.579> screwdriver<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this is I'm using a screwdriver and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
this is I'm using a screwdriver and
putting<00:00:45.870> pressure<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:47.059> as<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.120> can

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
putting pressure right here as you can

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.330 
putting pressure right here as you can
see<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.809> using<00:00:49.050> leverage<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.980> advantage

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
see I'm using leverage to my advantage

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.360 
see I'm using leverage to my advantage
to<00:00:51.530> bend<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.860> area<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.930> float<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:56.190> if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to bend this area of the float now if

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.900 
to bend this area of the float now if
you<00:00:56.520> put<00:00:56.730> any<00:00:56.879> pressure<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.420> bend<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> tab

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
you put any pressure or bend this tab

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
you put any pressure or bend this tab
along<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.960> area<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.100> crack

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
along in in this area you will crack

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.799 
along in in this area you will crack
something<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.090> break<00:01:03.270> something

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
something or break something

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
something or break something
then<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.830> buying<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> new<00:01:05.549> float

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
then you will be buying a new float

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.530 
then you will be buying a new float
which<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.299> around<00:01:06.810> $20<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.680> after-market

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
which is around $20 from after-market

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
which is around $20 from after-market
which<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> end<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> world<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
which is not the end of the world but we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.359 
which is not the end of the world but we
would<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> avoid<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> have

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
would like to avoid that so I have

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.100 
would like to avoid that so I have
already<00:01:14.580> put<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.000> pressure<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.659> bent<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
already put the pressure on and bent it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.840 
already put the pressure on and bent it
some<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.250> retest<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.150> remake

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
some now I'm going to retest and remake

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.530 
some now I'm going to retest and remake
ok<00:01:20.850> I've<00:01:20.939> readjusted<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.900> float<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
ok I've readjusted the float and

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.560 
ok I've readjusted the float and
reassemble<00:01:24.590> I've<00:01:25.590> got<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> needle<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.330> in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
reassemble I've got the needle back in

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.969 
reassemble I've got the needle back in
the<00:01:27.750> seat<00:01:28.100> I've<00:01:29.100> got<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> float<00:01:29.970> pin<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
the seat I've got the float pin back in

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.319 
the seat I've got the float pin back in
and<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> measure<00:01:32.640> across<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and I'm going to measure across the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.460 
and I'm going to measure across the
carburetor<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:36.540> looks<00:01:37.040> very<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:39.470> I've

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
carburetor and it looks very good I've

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.399 
carburetor and it looks very good I've
did<00:01:40.770> some<00:01:41.009> more<00:01:41.189> work<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.930> didn't<00:01:43.259> just

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
did some more work on this I didn't just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.609 
did some more work on this I didn't just
do<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> quickly<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:45.210> between<00:01:45.720> video

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
do it this quickly in between video

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.700 
do it this quickly in between video
breaks<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> I've<00:01:48.479> got<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.020> close<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.560> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
breaks so I've got it as close as I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.030 
breaks so I've got it as close as I
could<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> possibility<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:52.799> could

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
could it's the possibility that I could

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.240 
could it's the possibility that I could
get<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.649> little<00:01:55.649> closer<00:01:55.860> but

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
get that a little a little closer but

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.609 
get that a little a little closer but
it's<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.180> probability<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.990> couldn't<00:01:58.469> do

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it's in all probability I couldn't do

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190 
it's in all probability I couldn't do
any<00:01:58.829> better<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.430> I<00:02:00.030> could<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> lot

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
any better and I could actually do a lot

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.480 
any better and I could actually do a lot
more<00:02:01.530> damage<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> carburetor<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:05.159> have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
more damage to the carburetor now I have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
more damage to the carburetor now I have
the<00:02:05.640> noose<00:02:05.820> needle<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.420> seat<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the noose needle and seat in the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.010 
the noose needle and seat in the
carburetor<00:02:07.500> I've<00:02:08.009> cleaned<00:02:08.310> everything<00:02:08.700> up

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
carburetor I've cleaned everything up

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.150 
carburetor I've cleaned everything up
I'm<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:11.090> reassemble

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
I'm going to reassemble

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.530 
I'm going to reassemble
everything<00:02:14.160> these<00:02:14.340> carburetors<00:02:14.940> are<00:02:15.090> some<00:02:15.480> of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
everything these carburetors are some of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.680 
everything these carburetors are some of
the<00:02:15.629> easiest<00:02:16.110> carburetors<00:02:16.769> there<00:02:16.980> are<00:02:17.280> to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the easiest carburetors there are to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.630 
the easiest carburetors there are to
disassemble<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.750> reassemble<00:02:19.250> I'll<00:02:20.250> go<00:02:20.459> with

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
disassemble and reassemble I'll go with

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.559 
disassemble and reassemble I'll go with
a<00:02:20.730> new<00:02:20.879> gasket<00:02:22.760> everything<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.879> clean<00:02:24.209> I've

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
a new gasket everything is clean I've

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.920 
a new gasket everything is clean I've
blown<00:02:24.810> everything<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.970> before<00:02:27.720> this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930

actually with some of my past attempts
these<00:02:32.280> Jets<00:02:33.090> are<00:02:33.269> all<00:02:33.450> clean<00:02:33.750> inside<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.890> is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
these Jets are all clean inside this is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160 
these Jets are all clean inside this is
the<00:02:35.310> main<00:02:35.660> jet<00:02:36.660> here

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the main jet here

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.000 
the main jet here
it's<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.830> fixed<00:02:38.220> yet<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.670> has<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.269> very<00:02:39.510> clean

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
it's a fixed yet it has to be very clean

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's a fixed yet it has to be very clean
of<00:02:41.010> course<00:02:41.250> take<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.849> out<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:43.560> my<00:02:43.739> problem

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
of course take this out but my problem

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.930 
of course take this out but my problem
is<00:02:44.250> flooding

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
is flooding

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.030 
is flooding
so<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.910> flooding<00:02:48.329> problem<00:02:48.750> almost<00:02:49.680> certainly

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
so the flooding problem almost certainly

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.130 
so the flooding problem almost certainly
has<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.459> coming<00:02:50.880> from<00:02:51.090> either<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.569> gasket

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
has to be coming from either the gasket

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.970 
has to be coming from either the gasket
or<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.010> needle<00:02:53.370> seat<00:02:53.610> float<00:02:53.940> area<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> will

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
or the needle seat float area so I will

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.420 
or the needle seat float area so I will
reassemble<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.920> come<00:02:58.920> back

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
reassemble that and come back

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.830 
reassemble that and come back
I<00:02:59.459> have<00:03:00.239> reassembled<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.140> cup<00:03:01.950> carburetor<00:03:02.840> I

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
goodness I have really good threads on

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.479 
goodness I have really good threads on
the<00:04:00.510> backside<00:04:00.989> here<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.410> I'm<00:04:01.500> going<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.769> take

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
the backside here and I'm going to take

so<00:04:10.040> another<00:04:11.040> thing<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.230> when<00:04:13.380> you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
so another thing is that when you

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.650 
so another thing is that when you
tighten<00:04:13.709> down<00:04:13.859> these<00:04:14.160> four<00:04:14.790> screws<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.239> hold

the two carburetor bodies together with
this<00:04:19.579> soft<00:04:20.579> core<00:04:20.909> gasket<00:04:21.390> don't<00:04:22.019> tighten

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
this soft core gasket don't tighten

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.350 
this soft core gasket don't tighten
these<00:04:22.530> really<00:04:22.950> tight<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.520> tighten<00:04:24.090> them<00:04:24.240> all

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
these really tight but tighten them all

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.490

gaskets taking them off again you can if

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.410 
gaskets taking them off again you can if
this<00:04:32.790> carburetor<00:04:33.150> is<00:04:33.330> working<00:04:33.800> properly<00:04:34.800> and

this carburetor is working properly and
not<00:04:36.420> flooding<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.500> can<00:04:37.680> come<00:04:37.890> back<00:04:38.070> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
not flooding you can come back and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
tighten those more later but for this

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.770 
tighten those more later but for this
