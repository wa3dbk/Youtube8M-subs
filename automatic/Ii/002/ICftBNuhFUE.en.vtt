do recommend using a drill and an
eight-inch<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.190> drill

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
eight-inch bit so that you can drill

first<00:00:40.149> thing<00:00:40.329> I<00:00:40.420> did<00:00:40.480> was<00:00:40.750> prepare<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.379> board

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
punky wood along the edges so I used my

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.020 
punky wood along the edges so I used my
dremel<00:00:47.410> with<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.530> flap<00:00:47.829> sander<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.489> don't<00:00:48.879> have

to<00:00:49.120> be<00:00:49.239> really<00:00:49.480> precise<00:00:49.870> here<00:00:50.230> you<00:00:50.500> just<00:00:50.710> want

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
to be really precise here you just want

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.619 
to be really precise here you just want
to<00:00:50.920> make<00:00:51.070> sure<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.399> can<00:00:51.610> get<00:00:51.940> rid<00:00:52.149> of<00:00:52.180> any<00:00:52.540> of

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629

later<00:00:54.790> on<00:00:59.129> like<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.280> said<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.640> don't<00:01:00.820> want<00:01:00.970> to

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
later on like I said you don't want to

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.790 
later on like I said you don't want to
be<00:01:01.150> too<00:01:01.329> precise<00:01:01.720> here<00:01:02.019> otherwise<00:01:02.530> you'll

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
smooth finish I began with 400 grit and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
smooth finish I began with 400 grit and
then<00:02:04.229> switched<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> 600<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.790> finished

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.039 

along<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.150> way<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.269> discovered<00:02:21.569> there<00:02:21.930> were

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
along the way I discovered there were

along the way I discovered there were
some<00:02:22.230> cracks<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> edge<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.370> had<00:02:23.549> me

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
some cracks on the edge that had me

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.380 
some cracks on the edge that had me
worried

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
worried

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.059 
worried
so<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> flooded<00:02:24.959> them<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.409> some<00:02:25.560> water<00:02:25.799> than

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
so I flooded them with some water than

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.819 
so I flooded them with some water than
superglue<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.360> used<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.720> pipe<00:02:27.959> clamp<00:02:28.349> to

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
superglue and then used a pipe clamp to

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.850 
superglue and then used a pipe clamp to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
well the poly urethane was drying I went

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.119 
well the poly urethane was drying I went
ahead<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.099> began<00:03:11.639> applying<00:03:12.500> coats<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.650> flat

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.430 

next<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.880> position<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.660> top<00:03:29.870> plates<00:03:30.170> for

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
next I position the top plates for

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.660 
next I position the top plates for
mounting<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.800> table<00:03:31.160> legs

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
mounting the table legs

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.610 
mounting the table legs
I<00:03:31.700> wanted<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.360> install<00:03:32.840> these<00:03:33.050> close<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.500> the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
I wanted to install these close to the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.440 
I wanted to install these close to the
edge<00:03:33.739> but<00:03:33.980> not<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.430> close<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.120> mounting

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
edge but not so close that the mounting

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.180 
edge but not so close that the mounting
screws<00:03:35.810> might<00:03:36.110> pop<00:03:36.410> through<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.860> beveled

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
screws might pop through the beveled

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.210 
screws might pop through the beveled
edge<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.670> then<00:03:38.599> pre-drill<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.470> holes<00:03:39.709> for<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
edge I then pre-drill the holes for the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.100 
edge I then pre-drill the holes for the
screws<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.910> would<00:03:41.030> hold<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.330> top<00:03:41.569> plate<00:03:41.870> so

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
screws that would hold the top plate so

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.550 
screws that would hold the top plate so
that<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.290> wouldn't<00:03:42.560> crack<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.250> yoke<00:03:47.560> after

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
that it wouldn't crack the yoke after

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.660 
that it wouldn't crack the yoke after
installing<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.220> legs

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
installing the legs

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.220 
installing the legs
I<00:03:49.730> noticed<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:50.390> because<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.810> back<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.170> the

board is flat two of the legs appeared

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.259 
board is flat two of the legs appeared
to<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.170> leaning<00:03:54.470> inward<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.550> went<00:03:55.880> ahead<00:03:55.970> and

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
to be leaning inward so I went ahead and

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.390 
to be leaning inward so I went ahead and
used<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.660> couple<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.019> washers<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.680> shim<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.160> top

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400
