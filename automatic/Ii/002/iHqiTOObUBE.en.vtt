gold variety fig tree
here's<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.429> associated<00:00:09.120> fig<00:00:09.800> get<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.090> flat

both in shape

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.730 
both in shape
it's<00:00:16.119> nice<00:00:16.330> right<00:00:16.600> figure<00:00:17.050> there<00:00:17.939> this<00:00:18.939> doing

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
it's nice right figure there this doing

it's nice right figure there this doing
what<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.890> leaf<00:00:21.070> looks<00:00:21.340> like

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.979 

check<00:00:27.509> this<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.869> off<00:00:27.929> here

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:41.010 

that's<00:00:33.530> good

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.380 

is<00:00:41.560> it<00:00:41.830> fake<00:00:42.240> open<00:00:43.240> it<00:00:43.330> up

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.360 

nice<00:00:47.990> and<00:00:48.260> juicy

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.279 

try<00:00:53.150> that

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.470 

hmm

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.009 

I<00:01:01.510> think<00:01:02.140> FIGS<00:01:02.320> tastes<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:02.829> much<00:01:02.890> better<00:01:03.010> when

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I think FIGS tastes so much better when

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.090 
I think FIGS tastes so much better when
well<00:01:05.019> they're<00:01:05.199> ripe<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:05.620> when<00:01:05.830> they're<00:01:05.950> nice

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
well they're ripe but when they're nice

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.810 
well they're ripe but when they're nice
and<00:01:06.130> warm<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.750> Sun<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:09.460> really

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
and warm from the Sun just really

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.870 
and warm from the Sun just really
enhances<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.360> that's<00:01:11.020> sweet<00:01:11.640> sweetness

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.649 

nice<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.259> reason<00:01:23.500> I'm<00:01:23.619> pointing<00:01:23.800> this

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
nice but the reason I'm pointing this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350 
nice but the reason I'm pointing this
variety<00:01:25.659> out<00:01:25.810> as<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.610> started<00:01:27.610> in<00:01:27.729> their<00:01:27.940> lair

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
variety out as I started in their lair

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.980 
variety out as I started in their lair
some<00:01:28.690> time<00:01:28.900> back<00:01:29.110> it's<00:01:29.530> time<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.830> take<00:01:30.009> a<00:01:30.040> look

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
some time back it's time to take a look

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:53.800 
some time back it's time to take a look
see<00:01:31.990> if<00:01:32.080> it's<00:01:32.369> okay<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.490> separated

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.899 

oh<00:01:55.150> yeah<00:01:57.970> nice<00:01:58.970> amount<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.420> roots<00:01:59.540> for<00:01:59.810> that<00:01:59.930> I

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
oh yeah nice amount of roots for that I

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:30.080 
oh yeah nice amount of roots for that I
can<00:02:01.909> remove<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:02.360> one<00:02:03.190> no<00:02:04.190> problem

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.699 

so<00:02:31.090> I'll<00:02:31.269> take<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.540> off<00:02:31.750> down<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.170> bottom<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
so I'll take it off down the bottom and

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.280 
so I'll take it off down the bottom and
I<00:02:32.739> guess<00:02:33.329> sort<00:02:34.329> of<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.599> that<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.959> grown<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
I guess sort of like that the grown a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.050 
I guess sort of like that the grown a

so I got to remove it right here and it
was<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.930> easy

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.310 

good<00:04:02.960> amount<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.290> roots<00:04:03.410> here<00:04:05.920> Wow

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
good amount of roots here Wow

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.290 
good amount of roots here Wow
even<00:04:09.320> more<00:04:09.560> on<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.710> other<00:04:09.830> side<00:04:11.440> so<00:04:12.440> that's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
even more on the other side so that's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.970 
even more on the other side so that's
that's<00:04:14.300> plenty<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.900> roots<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.230> wish<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.590> ICEA

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
that's plenty of roots I wish the ICEA

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.960 
that's plenty of roots I wish the ICEA
black<00:04:16.250> had<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.670> many<00:04:16.850> roots<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.760> I'll<00:04:19.820> go

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
black had that many roots so I'll go

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.870 
black had that many roots so I'll go
ahead<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.269> plot<00:04:20.390> this<00:04:20.630> up
