hundred and forty nine years in this

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.380 
hundred and forty nine years in this
full<00:00:47.350> HD<00:00:47.769> variant<00:00:48.220> and<00:00:48.489> there's<00:00:48.850> also<00:00:49.119> another

full HD variant and there's also another

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.210 
full HD variant and there's also another
version<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:50.049> doesn't<00:00:50.260> have<00:00:50.559> this<00:00:51.010> high

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220

for<00:00:53.409> 199<00:00:54.309> so<00:00:54.549> I<00:00:54.580> think<00:00:54.850> that's<00:00:55.000> also<00:00:55.210> quite<00:00:55.629> a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
for 199 so I think that's also quite a

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.320 
for 199 so I think that's also quite a
good<00:00:55.750> price<00:00:56.140> now<00:00:57.040> if<00:00:57.250> we<00:00:57.400> turn<00:00:57.640> off<00:00:57.879> that<00:00:58.150> this

and<00:02:00.610> then<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.330> course<00:02:01.540> also<00:02:01.750> again<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.260> stop

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
and then of course also again a stop

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.660 
and then of course also again a stop
running<00:02:02.650> right<00:02:02.799> there<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.280> then<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:03.640> also

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
running right there and then we also

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.960 
running right there and then we also
have<00:02:04.240> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
have this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.180 
have this
speakers<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:05.660> on<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.900> back<00:02:06.290> unfortunately

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
speakers here on the back unfortunately

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.100 
speakers here on the back unfortunately
they<00:02:07.370> aren't<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.910> front<00:02:08.150> but<00:02:08.690> still<00:02:08.990> it's

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
they aren't on the front but still it's

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.380 
they aren't on the front but still it's
better<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.530> just<00:02:09.560> have<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.010> mono<00:02:10.460> speaker<00:02:10.670> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
better to just have a mono speaker and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.120 
better to just have a mono speaker and
then<00:02:11.630> less<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.080> at<00:02:12.230> least<00:02:12.350> we<00:02:12.560> also<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:13.100> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
then less but at least we also have a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.460 
then less but at least we also have a
five<00:02:13.550> megapixel<00:02:13.850> camera<00:02:14.300> right<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:14.960> which

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
five megapixel camera right here which

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.530 
five megapixel camera right here which
isn't<00:02:15.770> too<00:02:16.130> bad<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.580> you'll<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.330> that

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
isn't too bad but you'll get to that

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.310 
isn't too bad but you'll get to that
later<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.580> here<00:02:19.850> we<00:02:19.970> then<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.870> interface

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
later so here we then see the interface

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.530 
later so here we then see the interface
for<00:02:21.680> Michelle<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:22.330> unfortunately<00:02:23.330> they're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
for Michelle but unfortunately they're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.200 
for Michelle but unfortunately they're
very<00:02:23.720> much<00:02:24.020> changes<00:02:24.590> made<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.610> Android<00:02:26.000> OS

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
very much changes made to the Android OS

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.260 
very much changes made to the Android OS
but<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.290> also<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.890> for<00:02:28.160> example<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.820> little

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
but we also have for example a little

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.600 
but we also have for example a little
bit<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:30.200> small<00:02:30.650> apps<00:02:30.950> right<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.460> so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
bit of like small apps right here so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.090 
bit of like small apps right here so
that<00:02:31.730> they<00:02:31.880> have<00:02:32.440> multitasking<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.890> that's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
that they have multitasking so that's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.620 
that they have multitasking so that's
great<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.520> see<00:02:34.550> as<00:02:34.790> well<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.180> if<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.420> want<00:02:35.600> to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
great to see as well so if you want to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.840 
great to see as well so if you want to
check<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.960> calendar<00:02:36.320> 12<00:02:36.980> for<00:02:37.220> example<00:02:37.250> you're

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
check the calendar 12 for example you're

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.240 
check the calendar 12 for example you're
in<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.360> Chrome<00:02:39.050> browser<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.680> that's

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
in the Chrome browser and that's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.040 
in the Chrome browser and that's
certainly<00:02:40.640> possible<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.510> also<00:02:41.690> move

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
certainly possible and you can also move

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.590 
certainly possible and you can also move
this<00:02:42.320> around<00:02:42.470> wherever<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.610> want<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.090> so

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
this around wherever you want you so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.960 
this around wherever you want you so
that's<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.960> think<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.440> pretty<00:02:45.770> nice<00:02:46.070> feature<00:02:46.100> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
that's I think a pretty nice feature and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.650 
that's I think a pretty nice feature and
then<00:02:47.840> we<00:02:48.020> also<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.500> other<00:02:48.680> features<00:02:49.250> like

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
then we also have other features like

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.570 
then we also have other features like
calculator<00:02:50.660> right<00:02:50.960> here<00:02:51.290> or<00:02:51.710> also<00:02:52.040> something

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
calculator right here or also something

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.610 
calculator right here or also something
like<00:02:52.760> notes<00:02:53.090> but<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.540> think<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:54.440> is

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
like notes but I think that this is

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.250 
like notes but I think that this is
quite<00:02:54.920> useful<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.780> certainly<00:02:57.050> nice

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
quite useful and this is certainly nice

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.190 
quite useful and this is certainly nice
to<00:02:57.530> see<00:02:57.710> multitasking<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.850> such<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> low<00:02:59.930> budget

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
to see multitasking on such a low budget

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560 
to see multitasking on such a low budget
device<00:03:00.710> because<00:03:01.160> usually<00:03:01.340> we<00:03:02.030> only<00:03:02.060> find

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
device because usually we only find

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.110 
device because usually we only find
these<00:03:02.780> features<00:03:03.050> on<00:03:03.470> more<00:03:03.980> expensive<00:03:04.130> tablets

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
these features on more expensive tablets

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.979 
these features on more expensive tablets
like<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> pro<00:03:06.170> from<00:03:06.380> Samsung<00:03:06.950> for<00:03:07.220> example<00:03:07.989> now

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
like a pro from Samsung for example now

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.510 
like a pro from Samsung for example now
talking<00:03:09.530> about<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.920> performance

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
talking about the performance

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.300 
talking about the performance
we'll<00:03:10.790> find<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.360> 1.5<00:03:12.200> gigahertz<00:03:12.680> quad-core

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
we'll find a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.330 
we'll find a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.330> this<00:03:14.510> tablet<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.860> mostly

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
processor in this tablet and it's mostly

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.420 
processor in this tablet and it's mostly
latest<00:03:16.970> Neptune<00:03:17.480> 600<00:03:18.110> or<00:03:18.200> 800<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.370> a

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
latest Neptune 600 or 800 so it's a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.400 
latest Neptune 600 or 800 so it's a
little<00:03:19.550> bit<00:03:19.730> older<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:20.330> still<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:21.200> works

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
little bit older but still it works

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.890 
little bit older but still it works
pretty<00:03:21.800> good<00:03:21.920> especially<00:03:22.850> also<00:03:23.390> for<00:03:23.630> browsing

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
pretty good especially also for browsing

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.870 
pretty good especially also for browsing
who<00:03:24.230> we're<00:03:24.410> can't<00:03:24.739> even<00:03:25.070> for<00:03:25.280> games<00:03:25.489> as<00:03:25.700> we'll

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
who we're can't even for games as we'll

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.870 
who we're can't even for games as we'll
see<00:03:26.150> later<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:27.650> here<00:03:27.860> we<00:03:28.010> have<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.459> website

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
see later but here we have a website

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.120 
see later but here we have a website
that<00:03:29.120> has<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.450> lot<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.750> multi<00:03:30.230> media<00:03:30.560> content

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
that has a lot of multi media content

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.920 
that has a lot of multi media content
and<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.730> works<00:03:31.940> quite<00:03:32.120> well<00:03:32.300> it's<00:03:32.720> pretty

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and it works quite well it's pretty

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.920 
and it works quite well it's pretty
smooth<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.760> that's<00:03:34.760> great<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.209> see<00:03:35.420> as<00:03:35.630> well

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
smooth so that's great to see as well

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.520 
smooth so that's great to see as well
and<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.880> case<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.480> web<00:03:38.750> browsing<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.320> no

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
and so in that case a web browsing is no

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.530 
and so in that case a web browsing is no
issue<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.489> think<00:03:40.790> especially<00:03:40.910> for<00:03:41.450> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
issue and I think especially for the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.500 
issue and I think especially for the
price<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.560> very<00:03:43.010> nice<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.489> see<00:03:43.519> now<00:03:44.300> if<00:03:44.360> we

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
price this is very nice to see now if we

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.729 
price this is very nice to see now if we
are<00:03:44.630> going<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.930> take<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.110> look<00:03:45.380> at<00:03:45.500> these

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
are going to take a look at these

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.490 
are going to take a look at these
performance<00:03:46.519> in<00:03:46.700> each<00:03:46.940> bench<00:03:47.239> then<00:03:47.810> we'll<00:03:48.080> see

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
performance in each bench then we'll see

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.009 
performance in each bench then we'll see
that<00:03:48.680> we<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.700> score<00:03:50.060> one<00:03:50.390> thumb<00:03:50.600> behind

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
that we have the score one thumb behind

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.830 
that we have the score one thumb behind
64<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.370> multi-core<00:03:53.239> score<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.810> that

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
64 in the multi-core score and that

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.720 
64 in the multi-core score and that
certainly<00:03:54.650> not<00:03:54.800> really<00:03:55.130> impressive

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
certainly not really impressive

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.580 
certainly not really impressive
especially<00:03:55.880> comparing<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.019> other<00:03:57.140> devices

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
especially comparing it to other devices

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.930 
especially comparing it to other devices
so<00:03:58.100> here<00:03:58.640> for<00:03:58.820> example<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.420> Galaxy<00:03:59.989> s5<00:04:00.410> has

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
so here for example the Galaxy s5 has

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.970 
so here for example the Galaxy s5 has
2800<00:04:01.940> points<00:04:02.180> so<00:04:02.870> there's<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.260> big<00:04:03.650> gap<00:04:03.950> between

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
2800 points so there's a big gap between

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.270 
2800 points so there's a big gap between
those<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.480> still<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.230> despite<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.920> pretty

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
those but still it despite this pretty

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.100 
those but still it despite this pretty
low<00:04:07.580> score<00:04:07.940> we<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.239> actually<00:04:08.420> still<00:04:08.870> play

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
low score we can actually still play

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.890 
low score we can actually still play
games<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:09.800> think<00:04:09.920> that's<00:04:10.880> quite<00:04:11.150> impressive

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
games so I think that's quite impressive

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.230 
games so I think that's quite impressive
so<00:04:12.140> I<00:04:12.170> actually<00:04:12.440> test

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
so I actually test

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.260 
so I actually test
s-pulse<00:04:14.170> ate<00:04:14.350> here<00:04:14.650> which<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.400> also<00:04:15.700> quite

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
s-pulse ate here which is also quite

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.720 
s-pulse ate here which is also quite
intense<00:04:16.660> game<00:04:16.960> in<00:04:17.170> terms<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.920> graphics<00:04:18.520> and

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
intense game in terms of a graphics and

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.730 
intense game in terms of a graphics and
we'll<00:04:19.240> see<00:04:19.510> what<00:04:19.690> here<00:04:19.960> that<00:04:20.260> this<00:04:20.440> works

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:20.740 
we'll see what here that this works

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.070 
we'll see what here that this works
surprisingly<00:04:21.010> well<00:04:21.670> so<00:04:22.480> I<00:04:22.510> wasn't<00:04:22.750> very

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
surprisingly well so I wasn't very

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.850 
surprisingly well so I wasn't very
impressed

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
impressed

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.980 
impressed
just<00:04:24.190> with<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.580> fact<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:25.330> even<00:04:25.540> though<00:04:25.840> this

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
just with the fact that even though this

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.100 
just with the fact that even though this
tab<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.560> pretty<00:04:26.830> cheap<00:04:26.980> at<00:04:27.190> 250<00:04:28.180> years<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.870> can

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
tab is pretty cheap at 250 years it can

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.110 
tab is pretty cheap at 250 years it can
still<00:04:29.440> handle<00:04:29.740> games<00:04:30.190> such<00:04:30.460> as<00:04:30.490> pass<00:04:30.820> pause

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
still handle games such as pass pause

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.270 
still handle games such as pass pause
without<00:04:31.630> really<00:04:32.020> any<00:04:32.260> issue<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.770> even<00:04:33.040> if<00:04:33.160> you

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
without really any issue and even if you

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.910 
without really any issue and even if you
have<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.700> all<00:04:33.970> six<00:04:34.330> cars<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.500> frame

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
have like all six cars and in the frame

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.880 
have like all six cars and in the frame
and<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.580> still<00:04:36.880> works<00:04:37.180> pretty<00:04:37.510> nice<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.140> that's

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
and it still works pretty nice so that's

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.430 
and it still works pretty nice so that's
a<00:04:39.040> big<00:04:39.220> plus<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:39.550> me<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.300> they<00:04:41.080> were<00:04:41.230> just

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
a big plus for me and they were just

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.130 
a big plus for me and they were just
crash<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.920> burn<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:42.360> still<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.630> think<00:04:44.020> it's

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
crash and burn so still I think it's

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.480 
crash and burn so still I think it's
very<00:04:44.260> impressive<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.010> if<00:04:45.130> you're<00:04:45.280> just

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
very impressive and if you're just

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.190 
very impressive and if you're just
thinking<00:04:45.580> about<00:04:45.910> picking<00:04:46.300> up<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.510> 7<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.110> if

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
thinking about picking up the 7 and if

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.290 
thinking about picking up the 7 and if
you<00:04:47.290> want<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.560> play<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.800> game<00:04:48.070> from<00:04:48.910> nothing

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
you want to play a game from nothing

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.510 
you want to play a game from nothing
then<00:04:49.480> then<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.140> think<00:04:50.470> you'll<00:04:50.710> be<00:04:50.920> pretty<00:04:51.160> happy

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
then then I think you'll be pretty happy

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.160 
then then I think you'll be pretty happy
here<00:04:51.850> with<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.210> cycle<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:52.840> your<00:04:52.870> tap

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
here with the a cycle in your tap

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.260 
here with the a cycle in your tap
especially<00:04:54.070> also<00:04:54.280> with<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:54.670> very<00:04:55.060> nice

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
especially also with this very nice

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.990 
especially also with this very nice
display<00:04:55.600> which<00:04:56.080> is<00:04:56.110> also<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.830> big<00:04:57.280> plus<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.850> my

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
display which is also a big plus in my

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.150 
display which is also a big plus in my
opinion<00:04:58.450> at<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:59.080> price<00:04:59.470> range<00:04:59.740> it's<00:04:59.950> not

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
opinion at this price range it's not

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.880 
opinion at this price range it's not
really<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:01.330> all<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:02.050> tablets<00:05:02.380> that<00:05:02.530> we<00:05:02.710> have<00:05:02.860> a

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
really on all the tablets that we have a

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.190 
really on all the tablets that we have a
full<00:05:03.190> HD<00:05:03.550> IPS<00:05:03.580> panel<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.360> lot<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.660> them<00:05:04.840> still

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
full HD IPS panel a lot of them still

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.620 
full HD IPS panel a lot of them still
use<00:05:05.440> lower<00:05:05.890> resolution<00:05:06.490> panels<00:05:06.850> so<00:05:07.420> that's

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
use lower resolution panels so that's

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.110 
use lower resolution panels so that's
great<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.930> see<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.440> think<00:05:08.740> si<00:05:09.100> has<00:05:09.610> done<00:05:09.940> a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
great to see and I think si has done a

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.870 
great to see and I think si has done a
great<00:05:10.420> job<00:05:10.570> here<00:05:11.080> on<00:05:11.230> this<00:05:11.530> tablet<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:12.700> can

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
great job here on this tablet and I can

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.560 
great job here on this tablet and I can
just<00:05:13.030> highly<00:05:13.480> recommend<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:14.080> overall<00:05:15.390> now<00:05:16.390> if

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
just highly recommend it overall now if

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.380 
just highly recommend it overall now if
you<00:05:16.690> just<00:05:16.960> is<00:05:17.200> going<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.950> exit<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.640> app<00:05:18.880> you

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
you just is going to exit this app you

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.630 
you just is going to exit this app you
can<00:05:19.570> basically<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:20.200> swipe<00:05:20.530> from<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.950> top<00:05:21.070> to

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
can basically just swipe from the top to

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.550 
can basically just swipe from the top to
the<00:05:21.670> bottom<00:05:21.790> and<00:05:22.150> then<00:05:22.330> you<00:05:22.360> get<00:05:22.690> here<00:05:23.410> these

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
the bottom and then you get here these

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.910 
the bottom and then you get here these
on-screen<00:05:24.040> controls<00:05:24.640> back<00:05:25.120> and<00:05:25.590> then<00:05:26.590> we<00:05:26.770> can

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
on-screen controls back and then we can

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.610 
on-screen controls back and then we can
take<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.100> quick<00:05:27.370> look<00:05:27.700> at<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.480> cameras<00:05:29.020> now

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
take a quick look at the cameras now

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.010 
take a quick look at the cameras now
again<00:05:29.920> we<00:05:30.130> have<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.310> TAC<00:05:30.670> megapixel<00:05:31.360> sensor<00:05:31.840> on

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
again we have a TAC megapixel sensor on

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.840 
again we have a TAC megapixel sensor on
the<00:05:32.170> back<00:05:32.320> as<00:05:32.770> well<00:05:33.040> as<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.190> 2<00:05:33.340> megapixel

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
the back as well as the 2 megapixel

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.280 
the back as well as the 2 megapixel
sensor<00:05:34.180> on<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.420> front<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:34.840> took<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.110> couple

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
sensor on the front and I took a couple

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.740 
sensor on the front and I took a couple
of<00:05:35.470> pictures<00:05:35.710> earlier<00:05:36.040> and<00:05:36.490> it's<00:05:37.360> probably

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
of pictures earlier and it's probably

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.990 
of pictures earlier and it's probably
not<00:05:37.840> even<00:05:38.200> that<00:05:38.620> visible<00:05:39.130> here<00:05:39.430> on<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.820> video

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
not even that visible here on the video

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.990 
not even that visible here on the video
but<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:41.170> pictures<00:05:41.530> look<00:05:41.770> pretty<00:05:42.160> fuzzy<00:05:42.580> and

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
but the pictures look pretty fuzzy and

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.690 
but the pictures look pretty fuzzy and
just<00:05:43.720> Lego<00:05:44.050> he<00:05:44.350> didn't<00:05:44.680> stare<00:05:44.890> because<00:05:45.070> of

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
just Lego he didn't stare because of

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.760 
just Lego he didn't stare because of
course<00:05:46.090> 5<00:05:46.330> megapixels<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.170> pretty<00:05:47.470> low

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
course 5 megapixels is a pretty low

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.860 
course 5 megapixels is a pretty low
resolution<00:05:47.980> so<00:05:48.670> that's<00:05:49.240> not<00:05:49.450> really<00:05:49.840> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
resolution so that's not really a

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.860 
resolution so that's not really a
surprise<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.770> in<00:05:51.640> my<00:05:52.150> case<00:05:52.210> I<00:05:52.690> would

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
surprise and in my case I would

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.960 
surprise and in my case I would
certainly<00:05:53.110> always<00:05:53.560> recommend<00:05:54.160> rather<00:05:54.700> use

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
certainly always recommend rather use

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.940 
certainly always recommend rather use
your<00:05:55.180> phone<00:05:55.450> because<00:05:55.810> very<00:05:56.230> likely<00:05:56.470> has<00:05:56.920> a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
your phone because very likely has a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.370 
your phone because very likely has a
better<00:05:57.280> camera<00:05:57.540> but<00:05:58.540> then<00:05:58.930> again<00:05:59.050> if<00:05:59.290> you

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
better camera but then again if you

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.650 
better camera but then again if you
don't<00:05:59.560> have<00:05:59.830> any<00:06:00.130> other

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
don't have any other

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.470 
don't have any other
and<00:06:01.170> then<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.920> course<00:06:02.250> we<00:06:02.400> can<00:06:02.490> still<00:06:02.760> use<00:06:03.030> the

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
and then of course we can still use the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.500 
and then of course we can still use the
Iconia<00:06:03.990> attack<00:06:04.260> just<00:06:05.010> quickly<00:06:05.850> snapped<00:06:06.300> a

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
Iconia attack just quickly snapped a

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.880 
Iconia attack just quickly snapped a
tree<00:06:06.720> but<00:06:06.870> I<00:06:06.900> wouldn't<00:06:07.200> really<00:06:07.290> recommend<00:06:07.410> it

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
tree but I wouldn't really recommend it

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.200 
tree but I wouldn't really recommend it
because<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.250> cameras<00:06:08.670> aren't<00:06:08.880> that<00:06:09.030> great

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
because the cameras aren't that great

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.360 
because the cameras aren't that great
but<00:06:09.990> for<00:06:10.260> me<00:06:10.410> at<00:06:10.650> least<00:06:10.680> it's<00:06:11.160> way<00:06:11.340> more

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
but for me at least it's way more

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.580 
but for me at least it's way more
important<00:06:11.970> that<00:06:12.060> they<00:06:12.270> actually<00:06:12.990> used<00:06:13.230> a<00:06:13.380> high

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
important that they actually used a high

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.590 
important that they actually used a high
quality<00:06:13.950> IPS<00:06:14.550> kind<00:06:14.850> of<00:06:14.910> a<00:06:15.030> good<00:06:15.270> resolution

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
quality IPS kind of a good resolution

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.620 
quality IPS kind of a good resolution
here<00:06:16.140> and<00:06:16.350> also<00:06:17.010> a<00:06:17.280> processor<00:06:17.880> that<00:06:18.000> can<00:06:18.180> still

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
here and also a processor that can still

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.480 
here and also a processor that can still
handle<00:06:18.870> games<00:06:19.320> because<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.010> think<00:06:20.220> those<00:06:20.430> are

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
handle games because I think those are

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.400 
handle games because I think those are
aspects<00:06:21.090> that<00:06:21.210> are<00:06:21.360> way<00:06:21.510> more<00:06:21.540> important<00:06:22.260> than

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
aspects that are way more important than

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.370 
aspects that are way more important than
the<00:06:22.800> camera<00:06:23.220> so<00:06:23.520> I<00:06:23.790> think<00:06:24.090> overall<00:06:24.990> they<00:06:25.320> did

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
the camera so I think overall they did

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.620 
the camera so I think overall they did
great<00:06:26.010> choices<00:06:26.400> here<00:06:26.730> on<00:06:26.910> this<00:06:27.090> tablet<00:06:27.360> and

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
great choices here on this tablet and

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.840 
great choices here on this tablet and
especially<00:06:27.960> considering<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.740> price<00:06:29.040> this<00:06:29.790> is

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
especially considering the price this is

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.730 
especially considering the price this is
certainly<00:06:30.570> something<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:31.020> I<00:06:31.200> can<00:06:31.380> highly

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
certainly something that I can highly

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.770 
certainly something that I can highly
recommend
