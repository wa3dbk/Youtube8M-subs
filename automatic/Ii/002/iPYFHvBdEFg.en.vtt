00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good morning almost there this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 this time the stage of the tour de france 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.300
 the penultimate year six connects to these 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.330
 threats so a final climb is very 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.670
 complicated to his fashions his threats 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 during that second of difference between 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.460
 froome and contador the first two 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.500
 of a first show simply 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 terrible here in this sale just 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.070
 before the fields elysées it is bitter 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 it is rare that we are not against 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 the watch the day before the arrival 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.550
 here the 126 km very short so this 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.170
 step in the first category collar 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 so after the arrival the dan martin parr 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 every single push to have points 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.540
 for the polka dot jersey on what he does 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.920
 of course behind the super khune 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.390
 Gaulish brajkovic and perrot we see the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 platoon taken by the sky that passes this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 that there remains a neck 1 that their turn 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.199
 from France and there we are at the foot of this pass 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.120
 with the attak de joaquín rodríguez played 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.590
 by christopher froome and valverde no 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 of contador he does not react directly 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.250
 alberto contador pretty amazing he goes he 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.539
 comes behind there ilan open a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.960
 about fifteen seconds it goes further 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.460
 train on this attack group there are 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.930
 person in front of there is bigger 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.760
 escaped in this step just martin who 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.869
 at a price he sees me mulema who 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510
 tries to make the hole vandenbroucke 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.250
 behind voeckler and accelerate too 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.479
 voeckler that accelerated 22 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 new cases are where the stand is 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.409
 pedals and contador tries to get back on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.369
 the group of things he will succeed at 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.630
 do we see it quite easily so 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.270
 to finish here are the four best 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.880
 there are even so ugly feel like 22 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.090
 to say but otherwise we have the first 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 second the third and sixth round 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.820
 of France so the group voeckler trees 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 with pino pit anaky do not let go 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 wanted for the white jersey so pinault 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.520
 who knows that it must be a size to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 a feather a frames and runner 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.149
 are you baup we will have to do 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.000
 not what the future will tell us so we 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 left to this final climb to 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.079
 exprom that leads to the buffer this group from 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.670
 who hope for him has taken back 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.930
 of the beast because he was really 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.329
 not at best in the last stage of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.860
 christopher froome mountain being there for 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.240
 him it's time to react otherwise he'll 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.140
 to lose everything it is contador managed to 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.350
 take him more than seven seconds 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350
 today 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.569
 pinault that really puts them rolling to 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:17.159
 block behind we see it is difficult 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.079
 for thibaut pinot do they go kintana on 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.150
 the right is in trouble the runner 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.129
 French in any case the group of 4 is 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 gone this time it's a minimum and 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.890
 my is chasing potato behind he does 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.250
 will not succeed to return to this group of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.060
 head 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.590
 I have the impression in any case good webo 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.090
 rhythm and attacks of the same attack of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.439
 front games was a good tempo in this 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.750
 group is the Arctic proof authors 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.739
 try to follow and his pedal what a duel 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.500
 between two runners and contador who 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.720
 stuck contador who stuck to yahia and the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.769
 Tour de France as those played 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.879
 has the benefit chris froome who gave me a 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.049
 incredible attack but he is trained 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.329
 for thirty seconds on his pedals 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.189
 who will be too much what attack and there he 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.169
 rolls to block now it's terrible 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.090
 this terrible attack of chris froome 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.669
 the frankly oh the la what is it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.200
 has put on adore loves its value that must 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.939
 try to work now before 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.379
 to lead my valverde that she from a 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.970
 essence is irremediably by this 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.590
 attack of froome and kolda north and 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.980
 especially from froome by the way this is 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.989
 that part 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.419
 he left to win froome it's 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.040
 clear but it's not over yet 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.510
 queen tanaka touch at queen slap 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.879
 distance pineau beware the jersey 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.159
 white to play too behind at ty 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.459
 wigginton has and before froome who put 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.859
 20 seconds to the figure of his 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.690
 competitor contador to the red woman 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.489
 christopher froome has awakened arms and is going 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.349
 win the tour de france he goes 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.209
 take time to contador to finish 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.739
 So I was just there for you 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.079
 I need the cover of Harper's year 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.940
 days but he will get away the runner 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.919
 British Kenyan origin 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.349
 the stage win for chris froome 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.540
 magnificent stage victory in front of 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.849
 contador so we will finish at 15 more 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.319
 seconds to finish chris froome 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.939
 rodriguez 3 4 valverde 5 mollema ago 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.209
 a small hole after a small hole 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.680
 what we will see happen in the distance is 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.849
 vandenbroucke and clinton so I'm going 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.500
 again fourth general that he's going 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.180
 to call laughing I think we have some 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.769
 pass by harry van den broucke pineau 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.780
 finished after side there and therefore lose to 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.519
 fine tires will not do any better white 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.930
 voeckler goes on now and we see 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.329
 cadel evans when finishes there now 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.120
 then there is a big hole nice win 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.620
 chris Froome So that's 46 seconds 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.299
 of advanced on contador at stages a 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.460
 minute two on rodrigues and 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.620
 there would be no more than three minutes on the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.330
 octane group pretty awesome then 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.250
 our finished at 34 seconds of combat is 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.710
 so lost any chance of winning 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.240
 the white jersey damage for him here 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370
 individual general of 53 seconds 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.210
 of gap on final gap normally if 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.830
 everything is going well on the fields 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.509
 elysées will be the final gap of the round of 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.190
 la France 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.659
 valverde to three minutes and held up well 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.590
 after rodriguez is still more than 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:51.419
 7 minutes is pretty far chagan too 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.400
 won his jersey definitely he 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.900
 does not want to be joined anymore unless 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.199
 fall obviously this is the only solution 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.909
 for him to lose to 1t today 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.949
 abandoning these steps of the poor yohann 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.500
 gene that he had elysed fields must 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.789
 arrived off deadline starboard time and 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.500
 this is for the classification of the jersey to 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.690
 peas also finish and poor dan 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.430
 martin who can come times do not 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.990
 to win third place 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.759
 Rodriguez allows him to take the lead 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.020
 Rank 1 point this 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.259
 terrible that she was fighting there was 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.150
 so won by joaquín rodríguez 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.770
 lemaire young c quinn tana a 48 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.389
 of advanced nobu finish there has not been 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.199
 Photo 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.219
 even less so than for the 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.050
 yellow jersey fight we would not have 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:33.539
 raw saaq went to five systems of 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.099
 the arrival here is the end of this 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.240
 Step I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.979
 find quickly to be last 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.279
 stage of the turn of France to put all the 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.279
 world go
