00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 good afternoon dear friends and with you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.450
 again perpetuum or alexander and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.259
 today I present to you again in 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.210
 Once again 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.090
 interesting mod that will allow you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.299
 become a real alcoholic of course 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.220
 surely alcohol is very bad 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 clubs in life or would he be in the game 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 you can never drink alcohol 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 in general it is impossible he always hurts them badly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.470
 maybe at first you will be fine but 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 then you will regret it especially 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.050
 if overheated and also in the game like 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 how he would be good but the effects of it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 good is not all just bad for you 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.210
 nauseous 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
 you are dizzy you have helicopters in 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 you just turn you inside out 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.930
 there is no alcohol at all in principle 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.370
 but in the game in the game just to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.039
 celebrate meeting with a friend on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.840
 gaming space or just 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.950
 get mad and indulge it for this and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.020
 created exactly in the game 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.449
 let's see how to create it and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.610
 in addition to alcohol, which adds to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.010
 This game is a mod in the first place 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.309
 adds grapes around this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.600
 of this type they grow in the open spaces 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 Minecraft gaming can be found in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.250
 different places and you can also find here 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 this one is a wonderful wonderful wonderful 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.619
 hop 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 so what can we do with them 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.700
 first we are going to collect it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.119
 something like this we get it in hand 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.250
 and before the house we can again plant 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.140
 sense from him a little seed from him not 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.780
 fall out unfortunately I hope in the future 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.970
 from will refine them from these bushes will 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
 drop the seeds so we can plant them 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.420
 Eric cultivate and divorce well 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.180
 let's see how alcohol is created 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.310
 vodka wine and beer exactly these things 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.530
 adds maincraft to the game more precisely 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.570
 maynkrafta adds to the game in minekravt 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 yes I'm confused but it's okay let's 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.670
 let's see the first thing we need is 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.189
 alcohol is also created by alcohol to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.680
 create here is such an alcohol puree l channel 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.149
 I'm probably not wrong about the said 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.549
 but still for this us 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.649
 need coal and wheat we must 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.960
 a little fry wheat let's 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.630
 wait for it to prepare wheat 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 4 wheat has already been fried 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 while let the rest be fried and ready 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.129
 ingredients we will take away now in order 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.380
 to create one thinning vodka glass to us 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.350
 need 2 alcohol two buckets with 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 pure there and a few pieces specifically 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 7 pieces 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.130
 ordinary glass turns out with us 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.670
 something like this 1 2 two 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.050
 glasses of vodka to create wine 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.790
 let's see what we need 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.550
 in order to create wine first 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.930
 queue we need some glass 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.450
 specifically two times three 4 5 six pieces 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.070
 I forgot a little glass tip party so 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.620
 I ’ll get him now I hope you are not angry 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.080
 on me like this and like this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.670
 it turns out such a glass but for 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.660
 creating a wine at two of these need 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.710
 glasses let's make two glasses 1 and 2 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.350
 two glasses 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.510
 what do you need to do next 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 put these two glasses down on top 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.420
 put a bucket of alcohol and even higher 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.300
 put grapes and it turns out we 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 That is now the wine does not work, I 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.900
 confused 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.600
 We need vodka obtained here such here 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.730
 wine now we already have wine and vodka 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.220
 let's set it aside and then see what 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.590
 they do now need to create in 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.960
 the last thing is beer to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.470
 create a beer we need two buckets with 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.740
 by water 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.670
 one sugar cube and 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.560
 and and 3 hips with alcohol now we are 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.170
 let's get a second so I didn’t put it 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.420
 he needs alcohol so much 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:45.750
 the game in life does not need sugar and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.340
 alcohol so i'm confused for a second i'm not 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.830
 confused I'm sorry so to us 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.930
 need two buckets of water i'm big 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.810
 I am very sorry for blunted 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.290
 one piece of hops one bush or rather 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.000
 need sugar and three glasses with vodka 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.610
 we get such a beer 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 amazing beer now it's time 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.060
 check 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.530
 the effects that these fluids give us 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.590
 let's take a walk and 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.270
 let's see we begin with the most beer 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.010
 heavy drink here is beer no matter how 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.030
 strange I don't know why but beer 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.970
 greater effect 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.359
 cause harm to the player we drink it 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.720
 let's have a drink unfortunately i don't know 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.710
 Why is it possible because of a flaw in fashion 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.750
 doesn't work for me 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.970
 these ingredients most likely you have them 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.560
 will work because apparently once 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.300
 time does not have to manicraft like 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.840
 it is said but maykravt I do not have to 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.030
 just words explained what they do 1 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.460
 this vodka if a person drinks vodka 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.069
 his health begins to decrease 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.870
 up to half a heart that is you 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.970
 constantly nauseous head you by the way not 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.960
 spinning you just sick and you 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.000
 slowly killing 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.340
 cleaned up health I don't know why 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.160
 vodka is a fan of it 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.590
 yourself you kill i don't see 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.940
 move on if we drink 2 but y 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.400
 us the whole screen starting to twitch 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.199
 something like this is floating and you don't 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.190
 can concentrate on something 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.370
 this effect lasts 40 seconds no further 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.889
 more precisely 20 seconds further the same beer 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.710
 the very effect is slightly stronger than from 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.990
 wine and lasts 40 seconds if the wine 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.000
 lasted 20 seconds it is strange that beer 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.729
 beats on my head more than i do 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.289
 never seen it lasts 40 seconds 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.990
 the same effect and health you do not 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.690
 decreases drink vodka health 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.699
 decreased dizziness no drink 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.190
 the rest of the health does not decrease but 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.050
 there is dizziness that is when meeting 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.669
 with a friend on the gaming spaces of minecraft 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.780
 you can calmly note it 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.900
 the main thing that is not in life 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.120
 rejoice fuck this mod created 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.979

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.030
 only fan only entertainment only
