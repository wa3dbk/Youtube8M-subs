00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
jump around and this is probably the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.750 
jump around and this is probably the
last<00:00:11.450> of<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.260> fairly<00:00:12.830> easy<00:00:13.070> bases<00:00:13.580> alright

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
walls with barbarians and then we're

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.160 
walls with barbarians and then we're
going<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.100> send<00:00:34.310> in<00:00:34.430> archers<00:00:34.910> on<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.539> ones<00:00:35.930> in

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
going to send in archers on the ones in

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.069 
going to send in archers on the ones in
the<00:00:36.320> corner<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:36.860> before<00:00:37.789> that<00:00:38.180> Archer<00:00:38.870> tower

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
the corner and before that Archer tower

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.040 
the corner and before that Archer tower
on<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.649> bottom<00:00:40.070> corner<00:00:40.309> is<00:00:40.670> taken<00:00:41.120> out<00:00:41.329> we're

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
on the bottom corner is taken out we're

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.959 
on the bottom corner is taken out we're
going<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.199> send<00:00:42.530> in<00:00:42.710> our<00:00:42.920> balloon<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:43.730> does

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
going to send in our balloon it does

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.910 
going to send in our balloon it does
take<00:00:44.390> some<00:00:44.570> damage<00:00:44.780> but<00:00:44.960> that's<00:00:45.289> fine<00:00:45.620> our

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
take some damage but that's fine our

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.430 
take some damage but that's fine our
archers<00:00:46.609> at<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:46.879> top<00:00:47.090> right<00:00:47.420> finished<00:00:48.170> off

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
archers at the top right finished off

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.040 
archers at the top right finished off
the<00:00:48.800> with<00:00:49.370> Archer<00:00:50.030> tower<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:50.449> was<00:00:50.570> inside

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
the with Archer tower that was inside

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.919 
the with Archer tower that was inside
the<00:00:51.289> walls<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.859> I<00:00:52.820> think<00:00:53.359> we<00:00:53.449> have<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.660> couple

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
the walls and I think we have a couple

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.950 
the walls and I think we have a couple
of<00:00:54.109> archers<00:00:54.440> left<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:55.129> are<00:00:55.460> now<00:00:55.750> taking<00:00:56.750> out

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
of archers left that are now taking out

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.380 
of archers left that are now taking out
the<00:00:57.410> last<00:00:57.679> remaining<00:00:58.280> Archer<00:00:58.730> tower<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.269> then

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
the last remaining Archer tower and then

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.729 
the last remaining Archer tower and then
our<00:00:59.510> balloons<00:00:59.840> going<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.019> clean<00:01:00.230> up<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:00.589> it<00:01:00.710> was

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
our balloons going to clean up so it was

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.549 
our balloons going to clean up so it was
it<00:01:01.190> all<00:01:01.370> happened<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:01.969> a<00:01:02.359> flurry<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.199> the

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
it all happened in a flurry and the

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.830 
it all happened in a flurry and the
reason<00:01:03.920> for<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.160> again<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.940> because<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
reason for that again is because the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.750 
reason for that again is because the
defenses<00:01:06.410> are<00:01:06.530> distracted<00:01:07.250> by<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
defenses are distracted by the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.870 
defenses are distracted by the
barbarians<00:01:08.480> at<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.350> left<00:01:09.920> side<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.520> base

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
barbarians at the left side of the base

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.050 
barbarians at the left side of the base
while<00:01:11.660> we're<00:01:11.870> taking<00:01:12.230> out<00:01:12.380> those<00:01:12.650> those<00:01:13.250> air

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
while we're taking out those those air

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.150 
while we're taking out those those air
defenses<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.720> mean<00:01:14.930> we<00:01:15.020> end<00:01:15.170> up<00:01:15.290> losing<00:01:15.770> quite<00:01:16.100> a

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
defenses I mean we end up losing quite a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.490 
defenses I mean we end up losing quite a
few<00:01:16.520> down<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.510> bottom<00:01:17.720> end<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:18.350> that's

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
few down at that bottom end but that's

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.250 
few down at that bottom end but that's
okay<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.220> then<00:01:19.940> we're<00:01:20.210> taking<00:01:20.600> out<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.750> rest

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
okay and then we're taking out the rest

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.660 
okay and then we're taking out the rest
of<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.620> archer<00:01:21.980> towers<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.430> archer

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
of the archer towers and the archer

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.270 
of the archer towers and the archer
towers<00:01:23.000> are<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.270> big<00:01:23.990> threat<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.650> our<00:01:24.680> balloon<00:01:25.070> I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
towers are a big threat to our balloon I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.210 
towers are a big threat to our balloon I
mean<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.550> think<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:26.180> archer<00:01:26.510> towers<00:01:26.840> do<00:01:27.220> more

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
mean I think the archer towers do more

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.390 
mean I think the archer towers do more
damage<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:29.180> single<00:01:29.930> balloons<00:01:30.230> than<00:01:30.710> than

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
damage to single balloons than than

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.000 
damage to single balloons than than
wizard<00:01:31.730> towers<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.720> anyways<00:01:33.350> we're<00:01:33.800> just

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
wizard towers so anyways we're just

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.800 
wizard towers so anyways we're just
going<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.370> skip<00:01:34.640> ahead<00:01:34.760> here<00:01:34.940> or<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.390> did<00:01:35.570> skip

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
going to skip ahead here or we did skip

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.980 
going to skip ahead here or we did skip
ahead<00:01:35.930> or<00:01:36.230> we<00:01:36.380> will<00:01:36.710> skip<00:01:36.980> ahead<00:01:37.130> here<00:01:37.280> shortly

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
ahead or we will skip ahead here shortly

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.450 
ahead or we will skip ahead here shortly
in<00:01:38.990> order<00:01:39.230> to<00:01:39.290> finish<00:01:39.470> off<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.800> base<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.160> jump

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
in order to finish off the base so jump

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.700 
in order to finish off the base so jump
around<00:01:40.760> is<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:41.000> three<00:01:41.810> hundred<00:01:41.930> thousand<00:01:42.530> gold

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
around is a three hundred thousand gold

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.590 
around is a three hundred thousand gold
and<00:01:43.420> 300,000<00:01:44.420> elixir<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.470> return<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.570> now

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
and 300,000 elixir on the return and now

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.350 
and 300,000 elixir on the return and now
it<00:01:48.260> starts<00:01:48.950> getting<00:01:49.130> really<00:01:49.490> difficult<00:01:49.790> we're

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
it starts getting really difficult we're

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.870 
it starts getting really difficult we're
going<00:01:50.510> into<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.770> final<00:01:52.280> five<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
going into the final five the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.060
