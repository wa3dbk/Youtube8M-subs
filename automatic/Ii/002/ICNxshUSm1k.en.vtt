cars.com auto reviews

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.000
I am Kelsey Mays cars dot com and we're
at the Detroit Auto Show checking out

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.969
the new Cadillac

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.820
ATS the new small rear wheel drive
sports sedan from cattle I contains take

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.830
on the likes the BMW 3 Series

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.050
which is still the best selling luxury
car in the United States

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.490
what CEO at does love identifiable
Cadillac use your car doesn't look

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.160
instantly strong crap it actually is
pretty easy to

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.449
so to see this fits into the rest the
lineup you can see how far back to front

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:34.520
headlights go though

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.920
they and almost directly over the front
axle have an interesting

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.489
thing to look at their the overall
dimensions: make

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.769
the ATS about eight and a half inches
shorter from bumper to bumper than the

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:46.409
CTS

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.579
it's about an inch and a half narrower
and a couple inches shorter

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.579
wheels to Ruth Cadillac says me

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.710
ATS weighs in at less than thirty four
hundred pounds

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.809
that means that it's lighter than the
BMW 3 Series the Audi a4

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.440
even the Acura TSX good numbers from GM
who often brings

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.080
the heaviest car in class to the party
typical other sports sedan

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.520
the cabin is a little bit on the smaller
side not tired room

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.650
just kinda to stretch out here but I
think that drivers should find enough a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.310
if I move the seat all the way back in
about six feet tall that's not right

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.540
said that's it probably with it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.290
a couple inches forward so good
adjustment range there typical Cadillac

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.720
love the dashboard leopard or areas are
wrapped up in fake leather

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.410
is a nice upscale appearance and areas
that neither gonna touch

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.520
like right here are padded that's a nice
thing to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.250
the available manual transmission
appears to have nice

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.310
short throws we've never been that
satisfied with the manual in on the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.040
series

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.320
versions up the CTS this is kinda nice
change from that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.510
driving home the point the small cabin
is the back seat not a tight leg room

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.960
here in the states it's pretty low to
the ground 5 my knees kinda

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.060
up in the air that's right set to drive
the some headroom depending

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.520
way right leave kinda my back

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.640
I filing back it's not great but typical
for this segment which has pretty small

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.250
backseat

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.970
it some other European competition

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.940
truck size pretty small for the segment
two at about 10 points to cubic feet

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.150
sportsman's a small trucks the ATS has a
tiny truck according to specs but

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.810
actually think it's

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.330
pretty well organized Panamera but deep
enough for a large suitcase

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.710
fit back there up the three available
engines K like expects the 270

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.090
horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder to
be

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.950
be volume model the proof will be in the
driving a course but the ATS has a lot

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.310
of good ingredients bake 10

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.660
things like a 50-50 front and rear
weight distribution

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.920
and available adaptive suspension
available Brembo brakes

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.070
what to check back and see more after
we've driven it but we're excited to do

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.750
just that
