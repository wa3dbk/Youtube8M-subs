 it's the original one the turbo he has 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:11.370
 changed anyway it's a turbo to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.360
 variable geometry that snaps into 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.040
 function of how we press the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.610
 pedal 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:23.349
 agree and the air intakes on the roof 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:27.670
 and are cut or it's just stuck so 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:32.970

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.379
 also at his collar and where you cut 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:55.920
 to refresh the engine so you 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:03:03.000
 put that stuff but it's a pretty 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.000
 it's not pretty it's not tuning that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.299
 it's ugly 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.840
 tuning all those who make the team years 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.239
 you are 58 years old me I am 23 years old 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.099
 and I would like a car a bit 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.950
 in this style but not so abused because 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.849
 that it hurts the eyes because there is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.079
 stuff in every way and 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.720

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.910
 agrees that sludge that had smothered 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:04:01.900
 the bodywork and where there are a lot of 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:07.079
 sealant and paint the one who 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.079
 it was not you who penned it 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.120
 ok you tell him he does not work 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.660

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.769
 colors between the bumper and she 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.280
