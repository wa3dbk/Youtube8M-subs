00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it soaks into the cardboard and causes

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.380 
it soaks into the cardboard and causes
this<00:02:01.049> warping<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:02.100> found<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.149> cure<00:02:03.360> for

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this warping I have now found a cure for

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.889 
this warping I have now found a cure for
this<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.070> some<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
this what you do is you get some of this

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.510 
this what you do is you get some of this
universal<00:02:06.899> adhesive<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.829> who's<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.069> brand<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
universal adhesive you who's the brand I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.919 
universal adhesive you who's the brand I
use<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.539> one<00:02:09.720> pound

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
use because you can get it for one pound

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.840 
use because you can get it for one pound

when<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.690> glue<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.740> whatever<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.490> you're

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
when you glue the whatever it is you're

when you glue the whatever it is you're
gluing<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> base<00:02:18.270> such<00:02:18.720> as<00:02:18.750> these

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
gluing on to the base such as these

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.410 
gluing on to the base such as these
three<00:02:19.260> figures<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.800> instance<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:21.150> sure

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
three figures for instance you make sure

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.360 
three figures for instance you make sure
that<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.840> universal<00:02:22.350> adhesive<00:02:22.470> covers<00:02:23.220> the

that the universal adhesive covers the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.840 
that the universal adhesive covers the
entire<00:02:23.970> top<00:02:24.900> side<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.710> base<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.670> then

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
entire top side of the base you then

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.420 
entire top side of the base you then
leave<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.240> dry<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.860> texture<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
leave it to dry and then you texture it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.570 
leave it to dry and then you texture it
and<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.360> layer<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.960> glue<00:02:31.260> protects<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.340> card

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
and the layer of glue protects the card

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.390 
and the layer of glue protects the card
and<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.150> doesn't<00:02:33.510> warp<00:02:33.750> yeah<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> nice

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
and it doesn't warp yeah it's a nice

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.590 
and it doesn't warp yeah it's a nice
flat<00:02:36.120> bases<00:02:36.920> trenches<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.610> problem<00:02:39.240> for

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
flat bases trenches are a problem for

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.570 
flat bases trenches are a problem for
the<00:02:39.810> war<00:02:40.050> game<00:02:40.290> terrain<00:02:40.680> maker<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.310> trouble

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the war game terrain maker the trouble

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.790 
the war game terrain maker the trouble
is<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.850> they<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:42.480> downwards<00:02:43.320> into<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
is that they just go downwards into the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.990 
is that they just go downwards into the
earth<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.190> can't<00:02:44.370> really<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.670> digging

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
earth and you can't really be digging

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150 
earth and you can't really be digging
holes<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.390> your<00:02:45.510> dining<00:02:45.900> room<00:02:45.930> table<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.010> what

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
holes in your dining room table so what

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280 
holes in your dining room table so what
I've<00:02:47.340> come<00:02:47.520> up<00:02:47.580> with<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> compromise<00:02:49.020> I

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I've come up with here is a compromise I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.660 
I've come up with here is a compromise I
didn't<00:02:49.709> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.980> build<00:02:50.280> something<00:02:50.550> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
didn't want to build something that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.820 
didn't want to build something that
looked<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> small<00:02:51.480> hill<00:02:52.080> with<00:02:52.620> then

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
looked like a small hill with then

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.160 
looked like a small hill with then
trenches<00:02:53.250> dug<00:02:53.430> into<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.910> rather<00:02:54.090> bizarrely<00:02:54.540> so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
trenches dug into it rather bizarrely so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.780 
trenches dug into it rather bizarrely so
I've<00:02:55.530> come<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.100> with<00:02:56.130> something<00:02:56.550> which<00:02:56.670> is

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
I've come up with something which is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.120 
I've come up with something which is
only<00:02:57.030> actually<00:02:57.330> you'll<00:02:58.140> notice<00:02:58.500> when<00:02:58.890> viewed

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
only actually you'll notice when viewed

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.710 
only actually you'll notice when viewed
from<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.310> side<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.940> only<00:03:00.090> actually<00:03:00.360> about

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
from the side is only actually about

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.229 
from the side is only actually about
knee<00:03:01.110> height<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.950> these<00:03:02.130> soldiers<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
knee height to these soldiers so it

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.060 
knee height to these soldiers so it
wouldn't<00:03:03.450> really<00:03:03.510> protect<00:03:04.110> them<00:03:04.230> very<00:03:04.770> well

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
wouldn't really protect them very well

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.780 
wouldn't really protect them very well
but<00:03:05.670> from<00:03:06.120> above<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.050> think<00:03:07.830> they<00:03:08.160> suggest

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
but from above I think they suggest

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
but from above I think they suggest
trenches<00:03:09.300> well<00:03:09.510> enough<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> part<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
trenches well enough and part of the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.449 
trenches well enough and part of the
illusion<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.650> created<00:03:11.010> by<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.160> fact<00:03:11.340> that

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
illusion is created by the fact that

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.430 
illusion is created by the fact that
I've<00:03:11.640> painted<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.510> bottoms<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.170> them<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
I've painted the the bottoms of them a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.410 
I've painted the the bottoms of them a
much<00:03:13.800> darker<00:03:14.100> brown<00:03:14.580> than<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> surrounding

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
much darker brown than the surrounding

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.479 
much darker brown than the surrounding
earth<00:03:15.660> which<00:03:16.260> makes<00:03:16.769> them<00:03:16.920> look<00:03:17.040> deeper<00:03:17.370> than

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
earth which makes them look deeper than

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.009 
earth which makes them look deeper than
they<00:03:17.610> really<00:03:17.880> are

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
they really are

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.030 
they really are
it's<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.680> big<00:03:20.070> base<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.730> thick<00:03:21.360> card<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:22.380> which<00:03:22.769> I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
it's a big base of thick card on which I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.630 
it's a big base of thick card on which I
have<00:03:23.280> used<00:03:23.820> cork<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.870> Rio<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.280> create<00:03:26.400> the

have used cork to Rio to to create the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.020 
have used cork to Rio to to create the
heights<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.690> sandbags<00:03:28.500> are<00:03:28.769> dead<00:03:29.459> easy<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
heights the sandbags are dead easy to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.390 
heights the sandbags are dead easy to
make<00:03:30.209> why<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:31.200> people<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:31.860> all<00:03:32.040> make<00:03:32.220> their

make why do people not all make their

own sandbags what you do is you get

with corrugated sheet iron and what I've

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
got here is little bits of plastic now

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.509 
got here is little bits of plastic now
some<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.790> these<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.269> got<00:04:10.200> from<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:11.010> specialist

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
some of these I got from a specialist

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.090 
some of these I got from a specialist
modeling<00:04:12.150> shop<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:13.470> they're<00:04:13.650> thin<00:04:13.950> on<00:04:14.070> the

modeling shop but they're thin on the
ground<00:04:14.459> now<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.940> may<00:04:15.030> find<00:04:15.269> this

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
ground now and you may find this

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.330 
ground now and you may find this

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
difficult to get hold of but a lot of it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.330 
difficult to get hold of but a lot of it
is<00:04:17.519> actually<00:04:17.970> from<00:04:18.239> fruit<00:04:19.140> punnets<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.130> next

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
is actually from fruit punnets so next

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.500 
is actually from fruit punnets so next
time<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.609> buy<00:04:20.729> some<00:04:20.970> strawberries<00:04:21.390> or

time you buy some strawberries or

time you buy some strawberries or
something<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.900> they<00:04:21.959> come<00:04:22.109> in<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.260> plastic

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
something and they come in a plastic

bit of

bit of
plastic<00:04:25.980> that<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.160> can't<00:04:26.400> use<00:04:26.639> for<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:26.970> and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
plastic that you can't use for this and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.650 
plastic that you can't use for this and
you<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:27.810> paint<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.560> dry<00:04:29.010> brush<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.400> and

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
you just paint it and dry brush it and

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.330 
you just paint it and dry brush it and
there<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.720> go

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
there you go

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.159 
there you go
trenches<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.150> compromise<00:04:33.450> but<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:33.900> think<00:04:34.110> a

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
trenches it's a compromise but I think a

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.650 
trenches it's a compromise but I think a
fair<00:04:34.350> one<00:04:34.760> one<00:04:35.760> good<00:04:35.940> thing<00:04:35.970> about<00:04:36.120> trenches

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
fair one one good thing about trenches

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.300 
fair one one good thing about trenches
like<00:04:36.690> these<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.470> they<00:04:37.620> are<00:04:37.650> very<00:04:37.950> light

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
like these is that they are very light

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.700 
like these is that they are very light
and<00:04:38.340> very<00:04:38.610> durable<00:04:39.050> cork<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.200> extremely

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
and very durable cork is extremely

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.950 
and very durable cork is extremely
durable<00:04:40.980> material<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.510> throw<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> few

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
durable material and I can throw a few

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.540 
durable material and I can throw a few
of<00:04:43.020> these<00:04:43.200> into<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.530> box<00:04:43.800> then<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.280> goes<00:04:44.430> into

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
of these into a box then that goes into

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.460 
of these into a box then that goes into
my<00:04:44.669> rucksack<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.210> jump<00:04:45.480> onto<00:04:45.600> my<00:04:45.660> bike<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.200> I'm

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
my rucksack I jump onto my bike and I'm

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.940 
my rucksack I jump onto my bike and I'm
away<00:04:46.820> another<00:04:47.820> option<00:04:48.300> which<00:04:48.450> I'm<00:04:48.630> not<00:04:48.840> really

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
away another option which I'm not really

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.320 
away another option which I'm not really
recommending<00:04:49.950> for<00:04:50.160> forces<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.610> any<00:04:50.730> size<00:04:51.060> is

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
recommending for forces of any size is

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.900 
recommending for forces of any size is
to<00:04:51.900> make<00:04:52.110> specialist<00:04:52.710> entrenched<00:04:53.460> troops

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
to make specialist entrenched troops

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.240 
to make specialist entrenched troops
figures<00:04:54.480> they<00:04:55.050> see<00:04:55.110> what<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.650> do<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.040> you

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
figures they see what you can do is you

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.129 
figures they see what you can do is you
can<00:04:56.400> go<00:04:56.610> get<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:56.850> bit<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.150> card<00:04:57.419> build<00:04:57.870> up<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
can go get a bit of card build up the

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.530 
can go get a bit of card build up the
edges<00:04:58.380> with<00:04:58.410> mastic<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.160> then<00:05:00.150> cut<00:05:00.510> some

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
edges with mastic and then cut some

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.050 
edges with mastic and then cut some
figures<00:05:01.260> off<00:05:01.500> at<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.950> waist<00:05:02.190> or<00:05:02.460> maybe<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:02.880> bit

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
figures off at the waist or maybe a bit

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.940 
figures off at the waist or maybe a bit
higher<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.479> then<00:05:04.080> glue<00:05:04.440> them<00:05:04.620> in<00:05:04.770> to

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
higher and then glue them in to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.400 
higher and then glue them in to
represent<00:05:05.070> entrenched<00:05:05.940> figures<00:05:06.270> one<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
represent entrenched figures one of the

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.560 
represent entrenched figures one of the
many<00:05:07.560> problems<00:05:07.830> with<00:05:08.490> this<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:09.240> if<00:05:09.419> they

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
many problems with this is that if they

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.090 
many problems with this is that if they
want<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.840> move<00:05:10.050> anywhere<00:05:10.500> then<00:05:10.710> they<00:05:10.860> have<00:05:11.010> to

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
want to move anywhere then they have to

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.490 
want to move anywhere then they have to
leave<00:05:11.220> behind<00:05:11.580> them<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:12.090> foxhole<00:05:12.900> with<00:05:12.930> no<00:05:13.350> one

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
leave behind them a foxhole with no one

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.870 
leave behind them a foxhole with no one
in<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:13.889> then<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.070> have<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.340> make<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.490> load<00:05:14.729> of

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
in it so then you have to make a load of

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.650 
in it so then you have to make a load of
empty<00:05:15.510> foxhole<00:05:16.020> bases<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.150> this<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.330> lot<00:05:18.510> of

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
empty foxhole bases and this is a lot of

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:26.360 
empty foxhole bases and this is a lot of
faff<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:19.110> wouldn't<00:05:19.650> bother<00:05:19.740> frankly

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:36.950
