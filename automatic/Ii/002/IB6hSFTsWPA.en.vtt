 fresh not cooked well including cold medium 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.710
 and put thousands in the inside that 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.900
 milharina without jumping puts the foot note 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.300

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.770
 that business here is this fly here O 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.120
 I never researched is that because search 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.940
 This one does not strike me as a muriÃ§oca. 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.460
 right then this here if you want 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.290
 know sailing time that you have filled with 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.820
 gingado exposes a screen over the mouth 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.430
 of a drum, right? 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.350
 There you go , you see the Moscow flies. 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.790
 generated in there you take a look and 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.049
 give a researched and see what bug 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.780
 business here ok ok you have to 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:55.540
 prepare but less 40 days before you 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:58.600
 does so wins it's fresh corn is not 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.760
 they can cover it with water, and there 40 days 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.409
 More or less, it just starts to breed larvae. 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.630
 Okay, and then the next one's a little strong. 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.150
 in the backyard but can not pick up 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.760
 sun and no rain right there is every week 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.420
 more or less six punished so it's cool 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.850
 huh 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.330
 more or less 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.000
 It does not matter, it's according to the need. 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.850
 according to either larva or you 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.660
 can do so the work would be less 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.610
 transparent you have to can not 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.730
 to cap it 100% have to take oxygen 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.340
 otherwise the mother of the larvae will not 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.950
 in Spain corn every week also 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.620
 if you do this support fresh corn on top 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.540
 the animal eating corn the larva eating 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.980
 fresh corn, right? 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.190
 of course he will give but at the beginning 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.870
 It will be precise and clear it is no 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.110
 doubt that she will be 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.850
 Taste of me is not obvious, right? 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.820
 then the time to fish is prepared is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.150
 better and then you put 23 what you think 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.810
 It is better not quantity and when it is 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.990
 to fish 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.240
 there it was the new smaller zealand so it is with 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.010
 inclusive of corn 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.040
 you will also notice that it continues 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.930
 eating and it takes about a 40 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.550
 days to form their larvae according to 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.220
 with the temperature but you can not leave it at 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.140
 sun or rain can put on the bottom of 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.150
 Backyard living in the city or put in 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.040
 backyard there was a piece of 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.580
 eternit up there is that party of 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.720
 band like that the animals her mother 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.090
 comes urn boot 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.110
 then after he started calling you can 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.120
 keep them 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.610
 There is nothing missing, you will replace it in the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 half there stays the whole year then the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.240
 people have to be pro 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.550
 program to fish and fish. 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.920
 Excellent choice in winter and I'll sink 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.270
 for the winter 10 in a pawn cell 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.270
 then we do not even talk to jockey
