 find in everything exceeded we can 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.760

 whenever there is a vinaigrette with 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.670
 dijon mustard always convinces 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.230
 It combines perfect with tantita sugar 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 it can be agave honey with which 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.370

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.690

 Thread shape will move you until 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.150
 let's have a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.299
 we are frying ourselves 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.640
 sealing on all sides of the chicken 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.040

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.159
 very close cases of wanted to eat 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 chicken to good restaurants and they've gone 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.909
 very bad 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.489
 unfortunately the control for the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.220
 handling of the chicken suddenly the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.080
 chicken is one of the stents ingredients 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.050
 of the kitchen that any more we have 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.519

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.380
 I always tell them is the transmitter of 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.940
 salmonella not always but the only 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.730
 way you die to salmonella is 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.739
 freezing the one that falls asleep and if not to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.959
 very high temperatures please is very 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.480
 very important that it cooks 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.850
 perfectly if you see that your folio 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.580

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.190
