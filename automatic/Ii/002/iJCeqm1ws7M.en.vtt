00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
 let's start with a r8 gt v10 engine 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.650
 never strong 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.470
 turns all the force on the wheels crosses the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.000
 runway close to 300 per 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.939
 hour 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.989
 he has first and last name r8 gt version 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.090
 the most powerful of audi super sports 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.200
 that these two letters are 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.750
 capable 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.210
 the acronym gt comes from gran turismo a 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.579
 category of luxury cars made 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.730
 to rotate long highways 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.730
 velocity 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.989
 the r8 gt r is this concept 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.420
 the original model is already a supersport 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.359
 in appearance they are almost equal but 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.359
 in the gt version the engineers have overcome 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.060
 to make the car go even further 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.140
 designers and programmed the injection 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 electronics 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 the stir made the power jump from 525 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.400
 for 560 horses with heart in order 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.260
 they had to lose a few fat ones and they 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.050
 they got heavy on the car 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.500
 everything that was considered unnecessary 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.130
 was cut camera bank heating 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.440
 back 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.900
 the r8 gt does not have this comfort in 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.830
 compensation he won a little piece 100 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.700
 pounds lighter but not all made gt 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.440
 to run 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.080
 from time to time they reach the market 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.470
 passenger cars earning status 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 sportsmanship but by appearance than by 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 power 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.500
 it does not have the sporty appeal of the engine 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.590
 strong in the car so fast to accelerate the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.380
 sport appeal of el viso to tradition 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.680
 Of the gt's comes from afar a 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.560
 example already showed the strength of a gt 37 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.650
 years ago with the serious sound of the v8 engine 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 of 190 horses from this guy to a few in the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.690
 time is a car gt is the color called 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.660
 a lot of attention is also had 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.630
 gt was considered a boy of the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:13.220
 88 season gti revolutionized the market 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.750
 the carburetor and open the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.700
 path to the arrival of the injection 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.050
 electronics 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.099
 the 2.0 engine had 112 horses was capable 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.260
 to say the seat and nine seconds one 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.290
 brand was respected for a car of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.500
 ride over an eternity compared 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.500
 at time r8 3.6 seconds 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.709
 this huge indispensable rear wing 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.810
 to keep the car on the ground a320 per 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.510
 hour 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.310
 so willing to run help from the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.989
 electronics is welcome 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.180
 although the car has traction control 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.910
 control stability is important 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.310
 know that a car with a lot of power 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.650
 You will gradually have to know without 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.910
 give the foot of once the car has a 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.910
 pretty quick response 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.239
 gt like this requires preparation and 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.549
 responsibility of the person who directs and 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.760
 dealing with a rocket could not be 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.760
 different
