so<00:00:00.210> you<00:00:00.269> see<00:00:00.480> that's<00:00:00.630> little<00:00:01.079> soybeans<00:00:01.650> when

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so you see that's little soybeans when

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.840 
so you see that's little soybeans when
they're<00:00:02.610> really<00:00:03.510> hard<00:00:04.319> so<00:00:05.310> that's<00:00:05.490> why<00:00:05.670> we<00:00:05.819> put

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
they're really hard so that's why we put

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.600 
they're really hard so that's why we put
water<00:00:06.210> inside<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:07.080> make<00:00:07.680> them<00:00:07.859> extend<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.460> it

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
water inside to make them extend so it

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.910 
water inside to make them extend so it
becomes<00:00:08.940> two<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.870> three<00:00:10.110> times<00:00:10.320> bigger<00:00:10.679> than

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
becomes two to three times bigger than

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.690 
becomes two to three times bigger than
that<00:00:11.099> when<00:00:11.429> it's<00:00:11.610> when<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.509> soaked<00:00:13.429> it<00:00:14.429> goes

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
that when it's when it's soaked it goes

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.150 
that when it's when it's soaked it goes
into<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> cooker

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.210 

after<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.060> cooker<00:00:20.419> it's<00:00:20.990> passed<00:00:21.679> through

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
after the cooker it's passed through

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.060 
after the cooker it's passed through
some<00:00:22.550> filters<00:00:22.820> because<00:00:23.750> we<00:00:23.960> wanna<00:00:24.169> want<00:00:24.980> to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
put it in a big one which is the same

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.149 
put it in a big one which is the same
the<00:01:22.520> same<00:01:22.840> same<00:01:23.840> thing<00:01:24.020> as<00:01:24.140> small<00:01:24.380> one<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.979> we

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
the same same thing as small one and we

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.559 
the same same thing as small one and we
put<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.429> into<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.759> pasteurizer

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
put it into the pasteurizer

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.450 
put it into the pasteurizer
inside<00:01:26.929> the<00:01:27.049> pasteurizer<00:01:27.469> you<00:01:27.890> know<00:01:28.039> it's<00:01:28.249> all

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
inside the pasteurizer you know it's all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.489 
inside the pasteurizer you know it's all
like<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.359> it's<00:01:29.479> moving<00:01:29.719> really<00:01:30.079> slowly

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
like that and it's moving really slowly

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:33.520 
like that and it's moving really slowly
so<00:01:31.429> it's<00:01:31.999> all<00:01:32.210> committed<00:01:32.719> so<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.020> moves<00:01:33.200> slowly

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
so it's all committed so it moves slowly

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.710 
so it's all committed so it moves slowly
over<00:01:33.859> here

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
over here

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.810 
over here
and<00:01:36.260> after<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.860> drops<00:01:37.100> into<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.550> first<00:01:38.740> cooling

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
and after it drops into a first cooling

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.120 
and after it drops into a first cooling
so<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:40.880> know<00:01:41.120> all<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.450> bags<00:01:41.660> are<00:01:41.960> still<00:01:42.710> there

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so you know all the bags are still there

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.080 
so you know all the bags are still there
vacuum<00:01:43.640> seal<00:01:43.940> so<00:01:44.240> nothing<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.840> go<00:01:45.110> inside<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
vacuum seal so nothing can go inside and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
vacuum seal so nothing can go inside and
you<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.600> want<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.900> draw<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.110> temperature

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
you know we want to draw the temperature

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.650 
you know we want to draw the temperature
you<00:01:49.010> know<00:01:49.130> as<00:01:49.310> fast<00:01:49.610> as<00:01:49.790> possible<00:01:50.300> before<00:01:50.630> we

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
you know as fast as possible before we

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.690 
you know as fast as possible before we
can<00:01:50.900> put<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.410> fridge<00:01:51.650> so<00:01:52.250> that's<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
can put it in the fridge so that's the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.270 
can put it in the fridge so that's the
main<00:01:52.850> purpose<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.570> one<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.140> after<00:01:55.100> you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
main purpose of this one and after you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.620 
main purpose of this one and after you
know<00:01:55.430> once<00:01:55.760> it's<00:01:55.970> cooled<00:01:56.210> down<00:01:56.390> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
know once it's cooled down and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.810 
know once it's cooled down and
