okay<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.800> be<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> guess<00:00:02.280> now

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
okay this is going to be I guess now

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.280 
okay this is going to be I guess now
technically<00:00:03.060> part<00:00:03.300> three<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.230> to

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
technically part three this is going to

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.349 
technically part three this is going to
be<00:00:04.350> part<00:00:04.589> two<00:00:04.770> part<00:00:04.830> two<00:00:05.370> my<00:00:05.609> video<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.180> got

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
be part two part two my video that got

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.450 
be part two part two my video that got
cut<00:00:06.600> off<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:07.080> what<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.890> were<00:00:07.980> talking<00:00:08.370> about

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
cut off and what we were talking about

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.209 
cut off and what we were talking about
is<00:00:08.820> we're<00:00:09.450> talking<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:09.900> out<00:00:10.219> adding

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
is we're talking about out adding

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.180 
is we're talking about out adding
vectors<00:00:11.730> algebraically<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.530> vector<00:00:13.950> V

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
vectors algebraically so here vector V

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.540 
vectors algebraically so here vector V
goes<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:14.759> units<00:00:15.529> to<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.250> two

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
goes two units to the right and two

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.450 
goes two units to the right and two
units<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.060> that's<00:00:18.750> its<00:00:19.020> orientation<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.039> then

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
units up that's its orientation and then

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.189 
units up that's its orientation and then
vector<00:00:20.880> U<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.150> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.600> vector<00:00:21.840> that

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
vector U is going to be a vector that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.009 
vector U is going to be a vector that
just<00:00:22.350> goes<00:00:22.590> three<00:00:23.160> units<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> right<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
just goes three units to the right so to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.259 
just goes three units to the right so to
add<00:00:25.560> vectors<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.539> easy<00:00:29.150> notice<00:00:30.150> our

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
add vectors it's a very easy notice our

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.810 
add vectors it's a very easy notice our
new<00:00:30.300> vector<00:00:30.900> again<00:00:31.380> V<00:00:31.650> Plus<00:00:31.949> u<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.730> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
new vector again V Plus u from what we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.190 
new vector again V Plus u from what we
were<00:00:32.910> talking<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> other<00:00:33.750> video

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
were talking about in the other video

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
were talking about in the other video
our<00:00:34.590> vector<00:00:35.489> V<00:00:35.520> Plus<00:00:36.000> u<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
our vector V Plus u would look like the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.310 
our vector V Plus u would look like the
red<00:00:37.469> vector<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.420> vector<00:00:39.809> V<00:00:40.050> Plus

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
red vector so that's vector V Plus

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.510 
red vector so that's vector V Plus
vector<00:00:41.160> u<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:43.530> come<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.219> new

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
vector u and to come up with that new

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
vector u and to come up with that new
vector<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.500> add

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
vector all we have to do is just add

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.910 
vector all we have to do is just add
respective<00:00:47.670> components<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.559> describe

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
respective components so we can describe

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.090 
respective components so we can describe
V<00:00:50.730> by<00:00:51.300> being<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> vector<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.350> components<00:00:52.379> 2

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
V by being the vector with components 2

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.420 
V by being the vector with components 2
2<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.809> simply<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> describe<00:00:55.260> vector<00:00:55.770> u<00:00:56.010> well

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
2 and simply to describe vector u well

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
2 and simply to describe vector u well
what<00:00:56.699> does<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.300> goes<00:00:57.480> three<00:00:57.840> units<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
what does it do it goes three units to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
what does it do it goes three units to
the<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.250> doesn't<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.149> down

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the right but it doesn't go up or down

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
the right but it doesn't go up or down
at<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.920> would<00:01:02.070> describe<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
at all so we would describe it with the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.950 
at all so we would describe it with the
components<00:01:03.780> 3<00:01:04.110> comma<00:01:04.350> 0<00:01:05.000> just<00:01:06.000> add<00:01:06.180> respective

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
components 3 comma 0 just add respective

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
components 3 comma 0 just add respective
components<00:01:07.680> 2<00:01:07.920> +<00:01:08.280> 3<00:01:09.170> 2<00:01:10.170> +<00:01:10.560> 0<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.640> hey<00:01:12.030> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
components 2 + 3 2 + 0 and hey that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.469 
components 2 + 3 2 + 0 and hey that
gives<00:01:12.570> us<00:01:12.720> our<00:01:12.960> vector<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.890> components<00:01:14.479> 5

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
gives us our vector with components 5

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.320 
gives us our vector with components 5
comma<00:01:15.840> 2<00:01:16.170> which<00:01:16.950> again<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.610> definitely

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
comma 2 which again I think definitely

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.800 
comma 2 which again I think definitely
agrees<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.259> our<00:01:19.470> pictorial<00:01:20.720> discussion<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
agrees with our pictorial discussion a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
agrees with our pictorial discussion a
second<00:01:22.140> ago<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:24.420> simple<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:28.400> don't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
second ago so very simple to do I don't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
second ago so very simple to do I don't
know<00:01:29.549> maybe<00:01:29.820> let's<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:31.200> for

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
know maybe let's do one more just for

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.390 
know maybe let's do one more just for
fun<00:01:32.840> ok<00:01:33.840> suppose<00:01:34.049> we<00:01:34.380> stick<00:01:34.590> another<00:01:34.829> vector

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
fun ok suppose we stick another vector

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800 
fun ok suppose we stick another vector
on<00:01:35.640> there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
on there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
on there
suppose<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.530> stick<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.890> vector<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:38.880> know

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
suppose we stick on vector I don't know

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
suppose we stick on vector I don't know

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
W that goes straight down ok and suppose

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.030 
W that goes straight down ok and suppose
this<00:01:43.799> vector<00:01:44.280> stops<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> point<00:01:45.210> 5<00:01:45.720> comma

our<00:02:18.599> vector<00:02:19.200> W<00:02:19.650> well<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.580> doesn't<00:02:21.090> move<00:02:21.269> at<00:02:21.629> all

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
our vector W well it doesn't move at all

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.110 
our vector W well it doesn't move at all
horizontally<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.890> does<00:02:26.400> move<00:02:26.670> vertically

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
horizontally but it does move vertically

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.039 
horizontally but it does move vertically
so<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.599> goes<00:02:27.780> down<00:02:28.260> six<00:02:29.160> units<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.959> hope<00:02:30.959> I

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
so it goes down six units I hope I

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.780 
so it goes down six units I hope I
didn't<00:02:31.319> misspeak<00:02:31.680> earlier<00:02:32.069> now<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.489> thinking

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
didn't misspeak earlier now I'm thinking

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.830 
didn't misspeak earlier now I'm thinking
about<00:02:32.849> that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
about that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.360 
about that
so<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.090> vector<00:02:36.750> has<00:02:37.019> components<00:02:37.049> 0<00:02:37.769> comma

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
so so this vector has components 0 comma

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.990 
so so this vector has components 0 comma
negative<00:02:38.640> 6<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.480> again<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:39.930> add<00:02:41.000> or

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
negative 6 and again we just add or

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.449 
negative 6 and again we just add or
subtract<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:43.319> whatever<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.799> arithmetic<00:02:44.280> is

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
subtract do whatever the arithmetic is

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.470 
subtract do whatever the arithmetic is
on<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> respective<00:02:45.269> components<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.500> 2<00:02:47.000> 0<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
on the respective components so 2 0 and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.479 
on the respective components so 2 0 and
negative<00:02:48.870> 6<00:02:50.510> well<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:52.650> looks<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.250> gives

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
negative 6 well it looks like that gives

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.300 
negative 6 well it looks like that gives
us<00:02:53.640> 5<00:02:53.940> comma<00:02:54.420> negative<00:02:55.019> 4<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.160> said

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
us 5 comma negative 4 just like we said

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.940 
us 5 comma negative 4 just like we said
we<00:02:56.489> thought<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.819> should<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.470> very<00:02:58.590> easy

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
we thought it should so it's very easy

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.520 
we thought it should so it's very easy
to<00:02:59.099> add<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.760> subtract<00:03:00.530> components

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
to add and subtract components

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.610 
to add and subtract components
algebraically<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.610> add<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.239> subtract<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
algebraically just add and subtract the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.490 
algebraically just add and subtract the
respective<00:03:05.220> values<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.959> last<00:03:07.170> thing<00:03:07.379> I'm

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
respective values the last thing I'm

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.289 
respective values the last thing I'm
going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.680> talk<00:03:07.890> about<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.519> just<00:03:08.730> multiplying

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
going to talk about is just multiplying

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.000 
going to talk about is just multiplying
by<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.510> scalar<00:03:09.599> I'm<00:03:10.290> not<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.680> do<00:03:10.829> any

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
by a scalar I'm not going to do any

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.220 
by a scalar I'm not going to do any
pictures<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.730> one<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.269> very<00:03:12.780> easy<00:03:13.049> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
pictures with this one it's very easy to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.809 
pictures with this one it's very easy to
do

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
do

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.819 
do
suppose<00:03:14.819> vector<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.440> know<00:03:16.560> had

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
suppose vector you you know had

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.090 
suppose vector you you know had
components<00:03:17.459> 1<00:03:17.700> comma<00:03:17.970> 4<00:03:18.500> well<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:19.889> multiply

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
components 1 comma 4 well if we multiply

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.870 
components 1 comma 4 well if we multiply
by<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> scalar<00:03:21.900> by<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> number<00:03:22.530> again<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.670> makes

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
by a scalar by a number again that makes

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.860 
by a scalar by a number again that makes
a<00:03:24.120> vector<00:03:24.600> 10<00:03:24.930> times<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.530> long<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.430> case

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
a vector 10 times as long in this case

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.479 
a vector 10 times as long in this case
well<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.019> take<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.500> first<00:03:29.250> component

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
well I just take the first component

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
well I just take the first component
multiply<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.389> by<00:03:30.540> 10

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
multiply it by 10

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.259 
multiply it by 10
well<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:31.500> would<00:03:31.709> get<00:03:31.859> 10<00:03:32.099> take<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> second

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
well I would get 10 take the second

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.530 
well I would get 10 take the second
component<00:03:33.720> also<00:03:34.109> multiply<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.650> by<00:03:34.829> 10<00:03:35.130> ok<00:03:35.880> so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
component also multiply it by 10 ok so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.900 
component also multiply it by 10 ok so
that's<00:03:36.959> what<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.319> new<00:03:37.590> vector<00:03:38.250> would<00:03:38.700> look

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
that's what my new vector would look

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.330 
that's what my new vector would look
like<00:03:39.180> ok<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.169> I've<00:03:40.260> got<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.470> new<00:03:40.680> vector<00:03:41.130> with

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
like ok so I've got a new vector with

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.020 
like ok so I've got a new vector with
components<00:03:41.840> 10<00:03:42.840> comma<00:03:43.139> 40<00:03:43.730> likewise<00:03:44.730> if<00:03:44.970> we

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
components 10 comma 40 likewise if we

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.080 
components 10 comma 40 likewise if we
took<00:03:45.269> negative<00:03:45.720> 1/2<00:03:46.139> times<00:03:46.169> vector<00:03:46.889> u<00:03:47.090> you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
took negative 1/2 times vector u you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.879 
took negative 1/2 times vector u you
just<00:03:48.269> multiply<00:03:48.450> again<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.319> respective

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
just multiply again the respective

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.099 
just multiply again the respective
components<00:03:50.069> by<00:03:51.859> by<00:03:52.859> negative<00:03:53.250> 1/2<00:03:54.049> okay<00:03:55.049> so

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
components by by negative 1/2 okay so

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.839 
components by by negative 1/2 okay so
this<00:03:55.349> is<00:03:55.470> all<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.709> have<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.919> do<00:03:56.040> algebraically

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
this is all we have to do algebraically

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.140 
this is all we have to do algebraically
when<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.269> multiply<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.810> vector<00:03:57.930> by<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.709> scalar<00:03:59.340> so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
when we multiply a vector by a scalar so

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.069 
when we multiply a vector by a scalar so
we'll<00:04:00.989> simply<00:04:01.380> get<00:04:01.500> negative<00:04:01.739> 1/2<00:04:02.340> negative<00:04:03.269> 2

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
we'll simply get negative 1/2 negative 2

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.080 
we'll simply get negative 1/2 negative 2
4<00:04:04.739> as<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.190> components<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:06.000> new<00:04:06.450> vector

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
4 as the components for that new vector

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.569 
4 as the components for that new vector
maybe<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.419> last<00:04:09.720> example<00:04:10.099> so<00:04:11.099> again<00:04:11.340> maybe

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
maybe one last example so again maybe

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:17.750 
maybe one last example so again maybe
vector<00:04:12.120> U<00:04:14.000> has<00:04:15.000> components<00:04:15.480> 1<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.440> 4<00:04:16.760> let's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
vector U has components 1 and 4 let's

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.050 
vector U has components 1 and 4 let's
suppose<00:04:18.030> vector<00:04:18.539> W<00:04:19.349> has<00:04:19.829> components<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.760> don't

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
suppose vector W has components I don't

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.480 
suppose vector W has components I don't
know<00:04:21.209> negative<00:04:21.810> 2<00:04:22.049> &amp;<00:04:22.440> 3

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.550 

you<00:04:24.730> could<00:04:24.880> definitely<00:04:25.030> check<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:25.900> this

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
you could definitely check this this

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.470 
you could definitely check this this
computation<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.370> we're<00:04:27.610> about<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.120> by

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
computation that we're about to do by

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.780 
computation that we're about to do by
making<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.290> graphical<00:04:29.860> representation<00:04:30.310> I

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
making a graphical representation I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.300 
making a graphical representation I
think<00:04:31.030> it's<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.210> good<00:04:31.360> idea<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.720> do<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.310> just

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
think it's a good idea to do that just

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.040 
think it's a good idea to do that just
to<00:04:33.490> make<00:04:33.670> sure<00:04:33.700> you<00:04:33.970> really<00:04:34.150> make<00:04:34.870> that

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
to make sure you really make that

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.150 
to make sure you really make that
connection<00:04:35.320> so<00:04:35.710> suppose<00:04:36.580> we<00:04:36.850> take<00:04:37.030> you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
connection so suppose we take you

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.800 
connection so suppose we take you
suppose<00:04:39.160> we<00:04:39.340> subtract<00:04:39.820> away<00:04:40.000> two<00:04:40.180> times

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
suppose we subtract away two times

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.440 
suppose we subtract away two times
vector<00:04:41.260> W<00:04:42.120> okay<00:04:43.120> u<00:04:43.600> has<00:04:43.870> components<00:04:44.260> 1<00:04:44.710> 4<00:04:45.450> minus

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
vector W okay u has components 1 4 minus

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.590 
vector W okay u has components 1 4 minus
2<00:04:46.840> times<00:04:47.110> W<00:04:47.980> which<00:04:48.430> has<00:04:48.610> components<00:04:48.970> negative

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
2 times W which has components negative

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.140 
2 times W which has components negative
2<00:04:49.810> &amp;<00:04:50.200> 3<00:04:52.200> okay<00:04:53.200> we<00:04:53.350> can<00:04:53.500> basically<00:04:54.150> distribute

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
2 &amp; 3 okay we can basically distribute

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.960 
2 &amp; 3 okay we can basically distribute
the<00:04:55.330> negative<00:04:55.510> 2<00:04:56.310> inside<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.820> if<00:04:57.880> we

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
the negative 2 inside so if we

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.550 
the negative 2 inside so if we
distribute<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.540> negative<00:04:58.570> 2<00:04:58.990> we'll<00:04:59.230> simply

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
distribute the negative 2 we'll simply

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.100 
distribute the negative 2 we'll simply
get<00:04:59.680> 4<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.550> if<00:05:01.360> we<00:05:01.450> distribute<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.990> negative

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
get 4 and if we distribute the negative

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.490 
get 4 and if we distribute the negative
2<00:05:02.530> inside<00:05:02.920> we'll<00:05:03.250> get<00:05:03.370> negative<00:05:03.700> 6<00:05:04.240> if<00:05:04.930> we<00:05:05.230> add

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
2 inside we'll get negative 6 if we add

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.550 
2 inside we'll get negative 6 if we add
the<00:05:05.770> respective<00:05:06.190> components<00:05:07.030> 1<00:05:07.420> plus<00:05:07.690> 4<00:05:08.050> would

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
the respective components 1 plus 4 would

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.080 
the respective components 1 plus 4 would
be<00:05:08.740> 5<00:05:09.030> 4<00:05:10.030> -<00:05:10.180> 6<00:05:10.810> would<00:05:11.260> be<00:05:11.440> negative<00:05:12.070> 2<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:12.580> that

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
be 5 4 - 6 would be negative 2 and that

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.440 
be 5 4 - 6 would be negative 2 and that
would<00:05:13.180> be<00:05:13.360> your<00:05:13.570> new<00:05:14.020> vector<00:05:14.620> u<00:05:15.610> minus<00:05:16.120> 2w<00:05:18.450> all

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
would be your new vector u minus 2w all

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.960 
would be your new vector u minus 2w all
right<00:05:19.660> I<00:05:19.840> hope<00:05:20.530> this<00:05:20.770> video<00:05:21.070> makes<00:05:21.520> them<00:05:21.700> sense

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
right I hope this video makes them sense

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.280 
right I hope this video makes them sense
I<00:05:22.120> again<00:05:22.360> it's<00:05:22.540> sorry<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:22.990> other<00:05:23.140> one

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
I again it's sorry that the other one

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.860 
I again it's sorry that the other one
got<00:05:23.440> cut<00:05:23.740> off<00:05:24.240> hopefully<00:05:25.240> this<00:05:25.390> one<00:05:25.540> was<00:05:25.660> easy

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
got cut off hopefully this one was easy

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.530 
got cut off hopefully this one was easy
to<00:05:26.050> find<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:27.130> always<00:05:27.970> if<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.390> have<00:05:28.510> any

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
to find it is always if you have any

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.420 
to find it is always if you have any

them<00:05:30.720> hopefully<00:05:31.720> somebody<00:05:32.230> can<00:05:32.380> get<00:05:32.470> you

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
them hopefully somebody can get you

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.280 
them hopefully somebody can get you
going<00:05:32.860> in<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.010> right<00:05:33.130> direction
