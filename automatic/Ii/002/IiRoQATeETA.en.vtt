yeah and I've only fluctuated maybe a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.609 
yeah and I've only fluctuated maybe a
pound<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> half<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.789> very<00:00:27.090> most<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.840> um

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
pound and a half at the very most and um

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.010 
pound and a half at the very most and um
and<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:30.740> mean<00:00:31.740> I've<00:00:31.859> been<00:00:32.510> stabilized<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.840> not

and I mean I've been stabilized I'm not

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.750 
and I mean I've been stabilized I'm not
going<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:35.809> apparently<00:00:37.430> even<00:00:38.430> though

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
going up and down apparently even though

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.280 
going up and down apparently even though
it's<00:00:39.059> super<00:00:39.570> important<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:41.100> phase<00:00:41.489> three

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
it's super important to do phase three

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.310 
it's super important to do phase three
according<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> protocol<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
according to protocol so that we can

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.000 
according to protocol so that we can
reset<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> hypothalamus<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> higher

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
reset the hypothalamus to a higher

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
reset the hypothalamus to a higher
caloric<00:00:50.520> level<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:52.070> was<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:53.760> ill<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
caloric level I was very very ill the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.590 
caloric level I was very very ill the
very<00:00:54.539> first<00:00:54.840> week<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.350> phase<00:00:55.649> three<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.600> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
very first week of phase three and you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.490 
very first week of phase three and you
know<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> wasn't<00:00:58.469> able<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.840> to<00:01:00.840> eat

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
know that I wasn't able to to eat

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.979 
know that I wasn't able to to eat
according<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.010> protocol<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.239> totally

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
according to protocol and I was totally

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.070 
according to protocol and I was totally
tripping<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:06.360> I'd<00:01:06.540> come<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
tripping out on that because I'd come so

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
tripping out on that because I'd come so
far<00:01:07.380> doing<00:01:07.740> things<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> right<00:01:08.310> way<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
far doing things the right way and it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.770 
far doing things the right way and it
meant<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.930> much<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.439> me<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
meant so much to me to do it right so I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.300 
meant so much to me to do it right so I
I<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.950> distressed<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.000> distraught<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
I was so distressed and distraught I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.280 
I was so distressed and distraught I
thought<00:01:17.310> maybe<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.600> ruin<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.080> whole

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
thought maybe it would ruin my whole

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.640 
thought maybe it would ruin my whole
phase<00:01:19.650> three<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.369> HCG<00:01:20.970> diet<00:01:21.240> um<00:01:21.750> but

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
phase three of the HCG diet um but

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
phase three of the HCG diet um but
apparently<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.500> using<00:01:25.500> myself<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.460> an

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
apparently not so using myself as an

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.899 
apparently not so using myself as an
experiment<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:28.340> even<00:01:29.340> though<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
experiment here even though I really

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.980 
experiment here even though I really
wasn't<00:01:30.090> willing<00:01:32.000> apparently<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.360> does<00:01:33.659> take

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
wasn't willing apparently it does take

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
wasn't willing apparently it does take
the<00:01:34.140> full<00:01:34.380> three<00:01:34.680> weeks<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the full three weeks for you to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.039 
the full three weeks for you to
stabilize<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.670> not<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.909> recommend<00:01:39.299> doing

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
stabilize so not that I recommend doing

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.719 
stabilize so not that I recommend doing
what<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> did<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.490> never

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
what I did because I would never

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.350 
what I did because I would never
recommend<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.750> anybody<00:01:42.960> um<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.670> besides

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
recommend that to anybody um and besides

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.350 
recommend that to anybody um and besides
it<00:01:45.540> felt<00:01:45.930> gross<00:01:46.290> um

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it felt gross um

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.630 
it felt gross um
I<00:01:48.740> think<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:52.430> given<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
I think that you know given the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.320 
I think that you know given the
circumstances<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.700> fact<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.970> have

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
circumstances and the fact that I have

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.890 
circumstances and the fact that I have
stabilized<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.980> I've<00:01:59.490> been<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
stabilized and I've been like this you

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.360 
stabilized and I've been like this you
know<00:02:01.020> since<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:02.390> second<00:02:03.390> week<00:02:03.510> I<00:02:04.380> only<00:02:05.010> have

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
know since the second week I only have

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.570 
know since the second week I only have
less<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.300> week<00:02:06.510> left<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.710> doing<00:02:08.009> so

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
less than a week left and I'm doing so

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.110 
less than a week left and I'm doing so
good<00:02:08.820> so<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.640> given<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
good so I think that you know given the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.160 
good so I think that you know given the
entire<00:02:12.600> three<00:02:12.990> week<00:02:13.140> period<00:02:13.170> um<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.720> you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
entire three week period um you can you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
entire three week period um you can you
can<00:02:16.440> stabilize<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.060> same<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.570> things

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
can stabilize just the same and things

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.460 
can stabilize just the same and things
are<00:02:19.050> ok<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.850> if<00:02:21.450> anybody<00:02:21.840> else<00:02:22.050> got<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
are ok and so if anybody else got this

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.030 
are ok and so if anybody else got this
bug<00:02:22.740> out<00:02:22.980> there<00:02:23.330> letting<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.450> know<00:02:24.630> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
bug out there letting you know that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.130 
bug out there letting you know that
don't<00:02:26.040> trip<00:02:26.610> out<00:02:26.760> too<00:02:26.970> much<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.900> did

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
don't trip out too much over like I did

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.360 
don't trip out too much over like I did
um<00:02:29.510> now<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.840> tip<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.770> had<00:02:32.520> no<00:02:32.730> idea<00:02:32.760> but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
um now a tip I had no idea but

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.210 
um now a tip I had no idea but
apparently<00:02:35.840> when<00:02:36.840> some<00:02:37.170> people<00:02:37.470> go<00:02:37.650> from<00:02:37.920> face

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
apparently when some people go from face

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.630 
apparently when some people go from face
to<00:02:38.600> which<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> very<00:02:40.080> low<00:02:40.440> calorie<00:02:40.950> 500

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to which is the very low calorie 500

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.960 
to which is the very low calorie 500
calorie<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> day<00:02:42.630> diet<00:02:43.130> with<00:02:44.130> absolutely<00:02:44.730> no

fat in it to phase three which is fatty
fatty<00:02:49.350> foods<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.190> start<00:02:50.520> adding<00:02:50.700> them

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
fatty foods and you start adding them

fatty foods and you start adding them
that<00:02:51.720> apparently<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.500> trigger<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
that apparently can trigger a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.789 
that apparently can trigger a
gallbladder<00:02:53.310> attack<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:55.019> guess<00:02:55.290> its<00:02:55.530> more

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
gallbladder attack and I guess its more

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.360 
gallbladder attack and I guess its more
common<00:02:56.010> than<00:02:56.810> people<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.410> fact<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.799> never

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
common than people think in fact I never
