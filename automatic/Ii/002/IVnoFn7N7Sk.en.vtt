00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.250
 although many people still polish and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.560
 they lock their cars by hand more and more 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.290
 people are looking for one more way 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.950
 quick and more efficient to detail your 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.169
 vehicle for years the traditional polishing 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.720
 with machine was to use a 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.759
 professional rotary polisher that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.480
 it required a lot of training to avoid 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.910
 damage the paint although it is safe and easy 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.940
 to use the development of the polisher 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.240
 broken orbital can still be perceived 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 as intimidating and expensive the only other 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 alternative is the orbital although it is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 economic performance and functionality 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.060
 of an orbital is extremely limited 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.329
 for this reason we have designed the 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.180
 sexton detector of mcgwire a new 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.430
 tool that is connected to a drill 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 this tool serves as another option 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.159
 between polishing by hand and polishing with machine 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.500
 the director extends mcgwire works 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.810
 with your drill with cable and you can 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.530
 use for safe removal 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.040
 quick and easy 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.020
 light to moderate circular markings 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.900
 oxidation spots or for the application 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.680
 simple polishes and waxes with 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.700
 ease 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.300
 all this without risk or training or the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.070
 inversion of a broken orbital polisher 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 before working on your car with the 10 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.040
 by sexton of mcgwire start by washing and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.520
 drying your entire car and if necessary 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.860
 use our schmutz surface lakers 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.649
 to use day 3 is so simply 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.530
 insert the stem chaos into the drill and 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.420
 Tighten securely to eliminate 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.610
 defects like circular marks 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.890
 deep spots or scratches 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 we recommend our pads 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.770
 red foam cut and the ok me champion 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.479
 de maguire is attached to the pad 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.060
 of strong foam from me remove 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.060
 placing the pad firmly 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.160
 against 10 per sexton apply the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.010
 product directly to the pad and 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.250
 put it flat on the paint 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.439
 grip the handle press the drill and 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.659
 start polishing using pressure 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.239
 moderate down in a mode 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.939
 surpassing while maintaining the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.379
 flat pad against painting everything 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.209
 time 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.310
 remember to keep the drill 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.739
 perpendicular to the surface of the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.659
 paint all the time to provide 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.390
 maximum contact of the pad and 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.270
 coverage 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.940
 I worked one section at a time applying 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.040
 additional product as necessary 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.040
 until all the texts have been 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.769
 eliminated 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.530
 remove any product residue 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.810
 before applying polish to or it will be 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.000

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.760
 supreme shine 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.130
 to eliminate light circular marks 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.650
 and to add brightness we recommend 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.920
 our polishing pad Mary and the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.590
