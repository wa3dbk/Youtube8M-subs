00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
knife will do for this cutting all the

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.050 
knife will do for this cutting all the
way<00:01:16.270> through<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.630> bark<00:01:16.869> into<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.649> wood<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
way through the bark into the wood you

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.020 
way through the bark into the wood you
take<00:01:19.270> your<00:01:19.420> thumbnail<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.369> if<00:01:21.759> you're<00:01:21.910> doing

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
take your thumbnail and if you're doing

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.790 
take your thumbnail and if you're doing
it<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.420> while<00:01:22.959> the<00:01:23.080> tree<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.289> vigorously

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
it this while the tree is vigorously

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.020 
it this while the tree is vigorously
growing<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.429> bark<00:01:24.670> will<00:01:24.849> easily<00:01:25.119> peel<00:01:25.630> back

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
growing the bark will easily peel back

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.749 
growing the bark will easily peel back
from<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.149> wood<00:01:28.300> below<00:01:28.599> it

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.800 

next<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.880> take<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.329> piece<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.530> foot<00:01:34.710> wood<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.810> trim

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
next I take my piece of foot wood I trim

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.179 
next I take my piece of foot wood I trim
the<00:01:36.929> leaves<00:01:37.079> off<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.560> make<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.740> easier<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the leaves off to make it easier to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:48.250 
the leaves off to make it easier to
handle<00:01:42.469> then<00:01:43.469> I<00:01:43.590> slice<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.429> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> buds

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.690 

going<00:01:48.980> almost<00:01:49.340> halfway<00:01:49.640> through<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:51.320> branch

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
going almost halfway through the branch

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.020 
going almost halfway through the branch
make<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.730> long<00:01:53.090> even<00:01:53.960> slice<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.670> if<00:01:58.820> you're

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
make a long even slice and if you're

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.740 
make a long even slice and if you're
doing<00:01:59.360> this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
doing this

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.740 
doing this
well<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.620> budwood<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.100> actively<00:02:01.490> growing

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
well the budwood is actively growing

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.680 
well the budwood is actively growing
you'll<00:02:02.750> be<00:02:02.930> able<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.170> peel<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.650> bark<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.760> the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
you'll be able to peel the bark and the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.050 
you'll be able to peel the bark and the
wood<00:02:06.280> apart<00:02:07.280> from<00:02:07.460> each<00:02:07.610> other<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
wood apart from each other like that and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.520 
wood apart from each other like that and
you<00:02:11.240> take<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.690> make<00:02:12.080> sure<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.350> gonna<00:02:12.440> fit

will train them to grow up a single

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.430 
will train them to grow up a single
trunk<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.730> budded<00:03:57.239> variety<00:03:57.660> that<00:03:58.319> will

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
trunk of the budded variety that will

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.160 
trunk of the budded variety that will
get<00:03:58.590> 1<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.950> 2<00:03:59.099> metres<00:03:59.430> tall<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.450> next<00:04:00.780> season

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
get 1 to 2 metres tall the next season

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.900 
get 1 to 2 metres tall the next season
they're<00:04:01.500> ready<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.890> be<00:04:02.069> planted<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.609> the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
they're ready to be planted out in the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.819 
they're ready to be planted out in the
orchard<00:04:03.060> row<00:04:03.480> or<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.290> be<00:04:04.379> sold<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.799> other

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
orchard row or to be sold to other

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.490 
orchard row or to be sold to other
farmers<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:06.239> whole<00:04:06.480> process<00:04:06.720> takes<00:04:07.200> three

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
farmers this whole process takes three

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.589 
farmers this whole process takes three
seasons<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.519> if<00:04:08.669> you<00:04:08.790> start<00:04:09.060> some<00:04:09.299> seeds

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
seasons and so if you start some seeds

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.809
