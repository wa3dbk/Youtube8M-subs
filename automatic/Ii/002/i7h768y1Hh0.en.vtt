sixteenth and one in 32 so I chose n/a
because<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.220> think<00:02:26.519> that's<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:28.220> fits<00:02:29.220> best

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
because I think that's that fits best

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.039 
because I think that's that fits best
you<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.430> different<00:02:33.120> presets<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
you have different presets for the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.149 
you have different presets for the
slicing<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:35.180> choose<00:02:36.200> integrated<00:02:37.200> by<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> way<00:02:38.129> I

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
slicing I choose integrated by the way I

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.520 
slicing I choose integrated by the way I
guess<00:02:38.519> if<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.909> choose<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.810> warp<00:02:40.049> marker

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
guess if you choose the warp marker

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.369 
guess if you choose the warp marker
it'll<00:02:40.739> probably<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.940> bit<00:02:42.239> more<00:02:42.450> precise<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.230> I

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
it'll probably be bit more precise but I

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.190 
it'll probably be bit more precise but I
want<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.099> easiest<00:02:44.579> way<00:02:44.879> for<00:02:44.909> you<00:02:45.299> now<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
want the easiest way for you now so I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.589 
want the easiest way for you now so I
stick<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.730> tempo<00:02:48.180> doesn't<00:02:48.450> really

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
stick to this the tempo doesn't really

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.410 
stick to this the tempo doesn't really
matter<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.799> leave<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.040> there

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
matter so you can just leave it there

you<00:03:29.190> see<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.370> wasn't<00:03:29.669> really<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.450> time<00:03:31.139> but<00:03:31.620> as<00:03:31.739> I

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
you see I wasn't really in time but as I

is<00:03:47.099> half<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.489> then<00:03:47.579> higher<00:03:47.819> than<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.829> then

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
is half and then higher than that then

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.949 
is half and then higher than that then
the<00:03:50.069> second<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.699> so<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.269> forth<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
the second one and so on and so forth it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.960 
the second one and so on and so forth it
doesn't<00:03:52.199> represent<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:53.010> any<00:03:53.160> way<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.730> pitch

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
doesn't represent in any way the pitch

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.039 
doesn't represent in any way the pitch
or<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:55.519> rhythm<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.910> what<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.599> sang<00:03:57.840> but

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
or the rhythm of what I just sang but

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.460 
or the rhythm of what I just sang but
that<00:03:58.230> doesn't<00:03:58.560> really<00:03:58.709> matter<00:03:58.889> either<00:04:00.470> let's

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
that doesn't really matter either let's

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.199 
that doesn't really matter either let's
just<00:04:01.769> double<00:04:02.099> click<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.669> track<00:04:02.970> name

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
just double click on the track name

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.210 
just double click on the track name
again<00:04:03.690> because<00:04:04.379> we<00:04:04.500> need<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.799> see<00:04:04.980> what's

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
again because we need to see what's

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.080 
again because we need to see what's
going<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.549> here<00:04:06.919> I'll<00:04:07.919> zoom<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> bit<00:04:08.609> because

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
going on here I'll zoom in a bit because

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.170 
going on here I'll zoom in a bit because
you<00:04:09.209> need<00:04:09.389> to<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.989> tiny<00:04:10.410> little

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
you need to see this tiny little

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.849 
you need to see this tiny little
triangle<00:04:12.180> here<00:04:12.480> because<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.650> what

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
triangle here because this is what

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.069 
triangle here because this is what
what's<00:04:14.280> interesting<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:15.120> us<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.389> if<00:04:15.959> you

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
what's interesting to us now if you

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.020 
what's interesting to us now if you
click<00:04:16.260> on<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.739> see<00:04:16.949> that<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.760> slices

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
click on it you see that all the slices

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.839 
click on it you see that all the slices
are<00:04:18.479> represented<00:04:19.229> here<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:20.370> once<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.699> click

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
are represented here so once you click

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.550 
are represented here so once you click
on<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.090> slice<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:22.169> see<00:04:22.550> what<00:04:24.169> part<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.349> my

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
on a slice you see what part of my

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.970 
on a slice you see what part of my
recording

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
recording

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.380 
recording
is<00:04:27.490> actually<00:04:27.850> represented<00:04:28.780> by<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.200> slice

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
is actually represented by this slice

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.760 
is actually represented by this slice
each<00:04:31.390> each<00:04:32.200> one<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.650> these<00:04:32.800> have<00:04:33.520> individual

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
each each one of these have individual

each each one of these have individual
play<00:04:35.770> buttons<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.490> hit<00:04:36.640> this<00:04:36.820> boom

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
play buttons so if I hit this boom

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.160 
play buttons so if I hit this boom
you<00:04:38.350> see<00:04:38.560> it's<00:04:38.710> playing<00:04:39.070> this<00:04:39.540> if<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.960> were<00:04:41.110> to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
you see it's playing this if you were to

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.500 
you see it's playing this if you were to
use<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:42.240> sound

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
use this sound

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.660 
use this sound
you<00:04:43.930> should<00:04:44.170> probably<00:04:44.440> enlarge<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.400> bit

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
you should probably enlarge this a bit

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.700 
you should probably enlarge this a bit
because<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:47.080> too<00:04:47.350> short

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
because it's too short

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.590
