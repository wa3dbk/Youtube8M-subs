mostly what Coach got into is telling us
that<00:02:21.569> he<00:02:22.080> didn't<00:02:22.230> care<00:02:22.349> about<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that he didn't care about the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.839

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
game I think that's what that's what

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.010 
game I think that's what that's what
came<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.280> most<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.910> team<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:27.750> that's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
came out most of the team I think that's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.930 
came out most of the team I think that's
what<00:02:28.140> later<00:02:28.290> sir<00:02:28.500> how<00:02:29.400> many<00:02:29.580> students<00:02:29.819> feel

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
what later sir how many students feel

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.619 
what later sir how many students feel
like<00:02:30.060> sighs<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.580> again<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.030> did<00:02:33.860> bother<00:02:35.629> um

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
like sighs and again that did bother um

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.940 
like sighs and again that did bother um
I<00:02:36.840> think<00:02:36.870> when<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.319> him<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.530> foul<00:02:37.680> Trevor

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
I think when we got him a foul Trevor

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.559 
I think when we got him a foul Trevor
early<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.459> think<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.269> hurting<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
early I think that's what hurting the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.780 
early I think that's what hurting the
most<00:02:39.599> but<00:02:40.050> uh<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.470> feel<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.129> kept<00:02:41.550> going

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
most but uh I feel like we kept going

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.000 
most but uh I feel like we kept going
back<00:02:41.910> Adams<00:02:42.300> oh<00:02:42.510> no<00:02:42.959> matter<00:02:43.140> what<00:02:43.349> we<00:02:43.620> can't<00:02:43.800> we

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
back Adams oh no matter what we can't we

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.580 
back Adams oh no matter what we can't we
kept<00:02:44.190> pounding<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> lane<00:02:45.360> Nate<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
kept pounding in the lane Nate and the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.170 
kept pounding in the lane Nate and the
markets<00:02:46.980> kept<00:02:47.099> driving<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.519> laying<00:02:47.730> Marcus

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
markets kept driving to laying Marcus

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.880 
markets kept driving to laying Marcus
Luke<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.540> make<00:02:49.110> he'll<00:02:49.319> drop<00:02:49.440> into<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.739> lane

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
Luke and make he'll drop into the lane

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.559 
Luke and make he'll drop into the lane
so<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.879> that's<00:02:51.090> what<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.540> what

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
so I think that that's what that's what

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.780 
so I think that that's what that's what
helped<00:02:51.900> us<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.019> lot<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.489> got<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> bunch<00:02:53.730> of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
helped us a lot I got a bunch of

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.600 
helped us a lot I got a bunch of
offensive<00:02:54.180> rebound

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
offensive rebound

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.340 
offensive rebound
the<00:02:54.760> first<00:02:54.940> maybe<00:02:55.240> like<00:02:55.390> 10<00:02:55.600> minutes<00:02:56.050> how<00:02:56.230> are

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
the first maybe like 10 minutes how are

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.030 
the first maybe like 10 minutes how are
you<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.620> keep<00:02:56.770> him<00:02:56.920> off<00:02:58.140> oh<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.500> using<00:02:59.980> our

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
you I keep him off oh just using our

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.290 
you I keep him off oh just using our
principles<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.580> were<00:03:00.670> using<00:03:00.820> practices

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
principles that were using practices

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.140 
principles that were using practices
boxing<00:03:01.690> out<00:03:01.810> um<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:03.520> just<00:03:03.550> being<00:03:03.820> strong<00:03:04.030> with

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
boxing out um and just being strong with

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.490 
boxing out um and just being strong with
the<00:03:04.240> ball<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.660> think<00:03:04.960> that's<00:03:05.140> that's<00:03:05.290> what

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
the ball I think that's that's what

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.810 
the ball I think that's that's what
that's<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.010> that's<00:03:06.100> what<00:03:06.400> they<00:03:06.550> got<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
that's what that's what they got the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.670 
that's what that's what they got the
most<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.210> uh<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:07.900> weren't<00:03:08.140> boxing<00:03:08.470> out<00:03:08.530> they

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
most is uh we weren't boxing out they
