00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hi to all of you guys and welcome his 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.339
 gaming quarrels welcome to this one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.529
 new review this we will turn on from 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.179
 analyze the ram an exotic helmet for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.889
 the wizard class introduced with 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.630
 the house of wolves he who is one of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.700
 more refined pieces of armor thanks 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.650
 to its very particular aesthetic like 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 as usual there will be three skills 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 main the first infusion vi 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.769
 will allow you to recover your life 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.810
 every time you collect a sphere 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.820
 of light skills that we all have 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 already seen has proved very useful in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.300
 Crash raid even now with 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 the introduction of the arena mode 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.930
 it could also be used in this 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.610
 context has therefore all in all to the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.649
 moment this is a great skill that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.210
 in the most critical moments it allows me to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.829
 recover life quickly 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 simply by collecting a ball of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.460
 light hopes of light that simply 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 you may have created for yours 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.070
 comrades and that they could have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.750
 made for you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 in moments a little calmer than 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.289
 game without too much effort 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.910
 the second extraction ability 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.090
 of the scholar will allow you to 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 restore your super energy 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.690
 making a kill with the attack 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.940
 body body skill that all in all yes 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 it is useful if in pvp they are pivi e 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
 especially dealing with the sorcerer 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 which as you will know between the three 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 characters to the best body attacks a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.420
 body because in addition to having good 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.670
 skills strike from a lot farther 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 and therefore usually when using one 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.720
 sorcerer uses a lot more 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 body to body attacks rather than with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.240
 the class of the Titan or that of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.799
 hunter 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.420
 so all in all this one too 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.729
 turns out to be a great skill 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.320
 finally in the third ability and peculiarity 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.119
 of this exotic helmet and strength 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 of the ram that will increase yours 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.869
 armor and will allow you inflicting 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.729
 of melee attacks while yes 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.799
 use the subclass of the walker of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.990
 empty to exploit the benefits of theft 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.490
 of life a basic skill of the body 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.710
 a body that will work much more 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 simply basic life theft 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.520
 will work when it kills network with 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 the ability of the body body while giving thanks 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.280
 this helmet will allow you 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.140
 simply to hit yours 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000
 target with a melee attack e 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.399
 you won't even need to be equipped 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 this skill or theft of life e 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.180
 always thanks to this exotic helmet you 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.610
 you can very well use any 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.320
 other ability of the body body attack e 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.460
 take advantage of all the benefits of 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 therefore theft of life in practice 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.629
 you will be able to get two bonuses but 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 I only remind you of this if you use them 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.630
 the subclass of the walker of the void 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.220
 otherwise not 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.930
 you can take advantage of all the benefits 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.250
 of the last skill of the ram for 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.990
 regarding the armor instead 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.570
 increased many do not know how it works 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.760
 in practice when you play in the first 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.380
 p more armor mind the more life you have 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.640
 in fact, not all the characters are all 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.130
 players have the same amount 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.930
 of life if I am not mistaken the maximum lows of 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.560
 life to the possible to be obtained go by 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.050
 180 with the sorcerer without armor at 220 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.760
 with the Titan it was the armor in a few 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.810
 words thanks to this helmet thanks to 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.370
 this helmet 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.290
 you as a sorcerer can have it 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.740
 same amount of armor as a 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.970
 Titan therefore 220 and I assure you 220 is 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.620
 really much 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.630
 just think of the osiride tests 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.550
 however also the iron banner one 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.370
 revenge of credit not beaten therefore to 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.470
 300 the year ago 101 damage hitting the two 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.570
 Sometimes you will still be alive that cool 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 no this thing you could usually do here 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.960
 do with the titan thanks to this piece 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.640
 armor can now also be done with 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.230
 the sorcerer to be fucking 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 die-hard tanks 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.190
 and also with that under the house use 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.050
 I would say this helmet honestly 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.030
 both because if you use the walker 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.740
 empty you can play it a lot in the close 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 range very attached to opponents 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.220
 perhaps with a shotgun exploit 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.320
 Much melee attacks 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.910
 killing you recover super energy 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.650
 simply hitting collection that 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.360
 body body started to heal you and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.860
 on the fantastic ability precisely for one 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.020
 very aggressive and very game style 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.820
 in the close range while using it with 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.860
 you would be the basic sun singer 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.720
 much more resistant by activating those 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.550
 radiance and maybe also having the why 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.350
 reduces the damage you suffer during the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.270
 radiance all damage would be 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.920
 halved and with all the armor that 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.840
 you will therefore have all the life you will have 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.640
 you will be almost impossible to kill 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.709
 so let's say that all in all this 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.150
 currently it is probably the best 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.470
 exotic helmet for the class of the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.050
 sorcerer thanks to its versatility 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.180
 to its usefulness and abilities to say the least 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.010
 not very fantastic and removed the examples given 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.420
 concerning exclusively to pvp 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.070

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.810

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.970
 the utility and versatility of this 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.360
 helmet is worth for the pd is that for the
