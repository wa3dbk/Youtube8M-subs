00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
so i'm not actually sure how much was

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.640 
so i'm not actually sure how much was
spent<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.060> i've<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.810> these<00:00:21.930> styluses

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the case i'll start with the outside so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.979 
the case i'll start with the outside so
we've<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> two<00:00:41.910> legendaries<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.840> on

of<00:00:55.050> mine<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> upside<00:00:55.739> down<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.250> back<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> front

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
of mine is upside down and back to front

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.520 
of mine is upside down and back to front
because<00:00:57.989> I've<00:00:58.980> got<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.760> dangler<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
because I've got my dangler there so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.660 
because I've got my dangler there so
I'll<00:01:01.649> probably<00:01:01.800> move<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.520> side

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I'll probably move it to the other side

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
I'll probably move it to the other side
at<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.329> point<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.660> haven't<00:01:03.989> got<00:01:04.080> around

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

at some point I just haven't got around
to<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.439> yet<00:01:04.500> because<00:01:04.650> obviously<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> zip

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.630 
to it yet because obviously when the zip
does<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.270> comes<00:01:06.510> around<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:08.400> corner

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
does up it comes around to that corner

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
does up it comes around to that corner
but<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.659> choose<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.080> side<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.350> put<00:01:10.619> the

and two space lattices and that's just a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.770 
and two space lattices and that's just a
Velcro<00:01:39.420> strip<00:01:39.650> where<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> attaches<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.630> it's
