00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you're touring and you get to learn the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.259 
you're touring and you get to learn the
backgrounds<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.130> these<00:03:20.280> guys<00:03:20.519> that's<00:03:21.060> where

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
backgrounds of these guys that's where

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.759 
backgrounds of these guys that's where
you<00:03:21.329> really<00:03:21.359> really<00:03:22.019> enjoy<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.380> youth<00:03:22.620> you

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
you really really enjoy and youth you

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.050 
you really really enjoy and youth you
think<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.400> know<00:03:23.489> what<00:03:23.639> you're<00:03:23.700> missing<00:03:24.000> out

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
think you know what you're missing out

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.280 
think you know what you're missing out
on<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.389> much<00:03:24.540> because<00:03:24.690> you've<00:03:25.019> sort<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.230> got

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
on so much because you've sort of got

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.900 
on so much because you've sort of got
our<00:03:25.470> blinkers<00:03:25.829> on

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.500 

I<00:03:34.250> think<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.310> rewards<00:03:35.760> are<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.270> fact<00:03:36.450> that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
I think the rewards are in the fact that

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.120 
I think the rewards are in the fact that
if<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.440> can<00:03:37.560> create<00:03:37.740> something<00:03:38.010> that's

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
if you can create something that's

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.250 
if you can create something that's
successful<00:03:38.970> not<00:03:39.240> necessarily<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.870> result

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
successful not necessarily as a result

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.320 
successful not necessarily as a result
but<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.590> terms<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.700> atmosphere<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.210> you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
but in terms of the atmosphere that you

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.670 
but in terms of the atmosphere that you
built<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.780> can<00:03:42.870> create<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.110> family<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.590> get

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
built if you can create a family and get

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.950 
built if you can create a family and get
people<00:03:43.860> just<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.160> get<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:45.450> i<00:03:45.510> Sport<00:03:45.750> sport

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
people just to get on can i Sport sport

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.020 
people just to get on can i Sport sport
especially<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.370> level<00:03:47.640> would<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.880> get

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
especially this this level would I get

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.150 
especially this this level would I get
paid<00:03:48.210> so<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.630> not<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.830> it's<00:03:50.040> a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
paid so it's not as if it's a it's a

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.790 
paid so it's not as if it's a it's a
lifeline<00:03:50.520> for<00:03:50.550> them<00:03:51.200> they<00:03:52.200> actually<00:03:52.440> pay<00:03:52.770> to

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
lifeline for them they actually pay to

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.770 
lifeline for them they actually pay to
play<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.220> game<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.760> we<00:03:54.090> try<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.540> make<00:03:54.750> sure

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
play this game so we try to make sure

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.270 
play this game so we try to make sure
that<00:03:55.080> if<00:03:55.470> you're<00:03:55.530> going<00:03:55.710> to<00:03:55.800> pay<00:03:55.950> you're<00:03:56.160> going

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
that if you're going to pay you're going

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.380 
that if you're going to pay you're going
to<00:03:56.340> enjoy<00:03:56.460> yourself<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.970> have<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> really<00:03:57.240> good

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
time so yeah it's probably the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.810 
time so yeah it's probably the
challenges

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.150
