how'd<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.109> engine<00:00:31.380> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
how'd you do that the the engine is

in<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.710> fuel<00:01:20.490> economy<00:01:20.880> high<00:01:21.060> fuel

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in on was that fuel economy high fuel

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
in on was that fuel economy high fuel
economy<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> hybrid<00:01:22.350> model<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.009> not

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
economy for the hybrid model but not

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
economy for the hybrid model but not
only<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> just

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
only that you know the the way that just

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.749 
only that you know the the way that just
was<00:01:25.439> also<00:01:25.710> achieved<00:01:26.070> was<00:01:26.220> basically<00:01:26.549> by

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
was also achieved was basically by

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.249 
was also achieved was basically by
reducing<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> overall<00:01:27.420> weight<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
reducing the overall weight of the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.319 
reducing the overall weight of the

vehicle the weight of the 2012 Camry is

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.120 
vehicle the weight of the 2012 Camry is
roughly<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:30.840> 200<00:01:31.380> pounds<00:01:31.770> less<00:01:32.240> than<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
roughly about 200 pounds less than the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.069 
roughly about 200 pounds less than the
2011<00:01:35.130> model<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.119> only<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
2011 model but not only that a lot of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.090 
2011 model but not only that a lot of
the<00:01:37.380> fuel<00:01:38.040> economy<00:01:39.320> changes<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.890> due

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the fuel economy changes as well was due

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
the fuel economy changes as well was due
to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> overall<00:01:41.790> management<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> power

operate<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> hydrogen<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.720> system<00:01:52.110> we

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
operate the hydrogen right system we

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
operate the hydrogen right system we
were<00:01:52.350> able<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.740> achieve<00:01:52.799> those<00:01:53.460> ratings<00:01:53.790> now

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
were able to achieve those ratings now

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
were able to achieve those ratings now
you<00:01:54.509> did<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:54.930> other<00:01:55.079> changes<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.040> trunk<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you did some other changes the trunk is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
you did some other changes the trunk is
bigger<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.850> yes<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.290> did<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.619> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
bigger now yes and how did you do that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.440 
bigger now yes and how did you do that
while<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> trunk<00:01:59.759> has<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.360> increased

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
while the trunk has actually increased

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
while the trunk has actually increased
by<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.290> two<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> half<00:02:01.890> cubic<00:02:02.219> feet<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
by over two and a half cubic feet and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490 
by over two and a half cubic feet and
one<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.630> way<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.110> was<00:02:04.290> basically

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
one of the way that that was basically

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.520 
one of the way that that was basically
achieved<00:02:05.070> was<00:02:05.340> by<00:02:05.670> moving<00:02:06.600> some<00:02:06.869> components

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
achieved was by moving some components

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.590 
achieved was by moving some components
out<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> battery<00:02:08.399> pack<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
out of the battery pack of the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.650 
out of the battery pack of the
which<00:02:10.260> is<00:02:10.380> actually<00:02:10.560> placing<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.160> trunk

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
which is actually placing a trunk

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.660 
which is actually placing a trunk
specifically<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> dc-to-dc<00:02:13.670> converter

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
specifically the dc-to-dc converter

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460 
specifically the dc-to-dc converter
which<00:02:15.030> actually<00:02:15.210> supplies<00:02:15.690> electricity<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
which actually supplies electricity to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.530 
which actually supplies electricity to
the<00:02:16.740> electric<00:02:17.100> motors<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.970> particular

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the electric motors that particular

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.260 
the electric motors that particular
component<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.950> move<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.850> inverter

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
component was I can move to the inverter

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.300 
component was I can move to the inverter
which<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.720> now<00:02:21.840> under<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.140> hood<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.710> by

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
which is now under the hood so by

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.160 
which is now under the hood so by
actually<00:02:23.640> removing<00:02:24.120> moving<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.810> component

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
actually removing moving that component

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.720 
actually removing moving that component
from<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.620> battery<00:02:25.950> packs<00:02:26.160> under<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.580> hood

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
from the battery packs under the hood

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.120 
from the battery packs under the hood
the<00:02:27.380> engineer<00:02:28.380> was<00:02:28.560> able<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> make<00:02:29.100> that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the engineer was able to make that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.130 
the engineer was able to make that
battery<00:02:29.610> pack<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:30.060> little<00:02:30.240> smaller<00:02:30.660> little

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
battery pack a little smaller little

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
battery pack a little smaller little
less<00:02:31.380> wide<00:02:31.710> okay<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.400> something<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.880> were

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
less wide okay on something they were

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.670 
less wide okay on something they were
able<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.330> push<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.810> battery<00:02:34.050> pack<00:02:34.110> further

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
able to push the battery pack further

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.370 
able to push the battery pack further
into<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> trunk<00:02:35.460> area<00:02:35.730> by<00:02:36.390> about<00:02:36.600> five<00:02:37.020> inches

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
into the trunk area by about five inches

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.220 
into the trunk area by about five inches
thus<00:02:37.980> increasing<00:02:38.520> overall<00:02:38.850> be<00:02:39.150> between<00:02:39.330> 5<00:02:40.020> out

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
thus increasing overall be between 5 out

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.460 
thus increasing overall be between 5 out
too<00:02:41.150> well<00:02:42.150> Toyotas<00:02:42.540> done<00:02:42.720> some<00:02:42.900> other<00:02:43.050> magic

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
too well Toyotas done some other magic

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.260 
too well Toyotas done some other magic
with<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.800> car<00:02:44.040> yeah<00:02:45.320> it's<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.530> same<00:02:46.740> length

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
with this car yeah it's the same length

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.320 
with this car yeah it's the same length
as<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.330> same<00:02:48.750> wheelbase<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.530> yet<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> get

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
as the same wheelbase and yet when I get

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.450 
as the same wheelbase and yet when I get
in<00:02:51.420> particularly<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.990> backseat<00:02:52.460> it's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
in particularly in the backseat it's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.060 
in particularly in the backseat it's
roomier<00:02:53.910> how'd<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.990> guys<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.800> mean

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
roomier how'd you guys do that I mean

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.140 
roomier how'd you guys do that I mean
you<00:02:56.160> got<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.400> kinds<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.730> tricks<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.120> your

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
you got all kinds of tricks up your

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390 
you got all kinds of tricks up your
sleeve<00:02:57.480> yeah<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.020> overall<00:02:58.560> increase<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.250> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
sleeve yeah the overall increase to the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.600 
sleeve yeah the overall increase to the
interior<00:02:59.700> compartment<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:01.370> approximately<00:03:02.370> 2

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
interior compartment is approximately 2

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.550 
interior compartment is approximately 2
cubic<00:03:03.090> feet<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.530> basically

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
cubic feet so that was basically

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.510 
cubic feet so that was basically
achieved<00:03:05.400> by<00:03:06.950> reassessing<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:07.980> overall

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
achieved by reassessing the overall

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.640 
achieved by reassessing the overall
interior<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.180> finding<00:03:09.540> out<00:03:09.630> areas<00:03:10.230> where<00:03:10.470> we

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
interior and finding out areas where we

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.680 
interior and finding out areas where we
where<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.520> actually<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:12.090> know<00:03:12.210> achieve

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
where we can actually you know achieve

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.690 
where we can actually you know achieve
additional<00:03:13.230> space<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> ways<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.580> it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
additional space one of the ways that it

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.670 
additional space one of the ways that it
was<00:03:14.820> achieved<00:03:14.940> was<00:03:15.600> by<00:03:15.810> actually<00:03:16.230> reshaping

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
was achieved was by actually reshaping

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.310 
was achieved was by actually reshaping
the<00:03:16.950> interior<00:03:17.400> door<00:03:17.640> trim<00:03:17.910> panels<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:19.200> know

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the interior door trim panels you know

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.740 
the interior door trim panels you know
again<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.370> give<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.760> feeling<00:03:21.210> of<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.480> little

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
again to give it a feeling of a little

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.890 
again to give it a feeling of a little
bit<00:03:21.870> more<00:03:22.020> spaciousness<00:03:22.550> another<00:03:23.550> way<00:03:23.900> was

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
bit more spaciousness another way was

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.020 
bit more spaciousness another way was
basically<00:03:25.260> by<00:03:25.500> redesigning<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.880> actual

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
basically by redesigning the the actual

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.170 
basically by redesigning the the actual
front<00:03:27.510> seats<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:28.770> well<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.790> mentioned<00:03:30.000> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
front seats as well you mentioned that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.300 
front seats as well you mentioned that
you<00:03:30.270> found<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.570> lot<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.870> leg<00:03:31.200> room<00:03:31.230> yes<00:03:31.770> Mack<00:03:32.280> yes

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
you found a lot of leg room yes Mack yes

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.820 
you found a lot of leg room yes Mack yes
yeah<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.210> rear<00:03:33.450> seat<00:03:33.720> pads<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.530> front

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
yeah the rear seat pads of the front

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.470 
yeah the rear seat pads of the front
seats<00:03:35.040> are<00:03:35.160> actually<00:03:35.430> carved<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> little

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
seats are actually carved out a little

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.630 
seats are actually carved out a little
more<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.990> actually<00:03:37.260> allow<00:03:37.350> for<00:03:37.800> more<00:03:37.980> more

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
more to actually allow for more more

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.240 
more to actually allow for more more
more<00:03:39.030> knee<00:03:39.240> room<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.410> only<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
more knee room but not only that the
