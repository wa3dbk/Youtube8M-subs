into skin lesions so here we are so I'm
going<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> take<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> page<00:00:19.020> from<00:00:19.320> chapter<00:00:20.189> 33<00:00:20.670> and

going to take a page from chapter 33 and
I<00:00:21.810> scanned<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> couple<00:00:22.470> weeks<00:00:22.590> ago<00:00:22.859> for

I scanned it in a couple weeks ago for

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
I scanned it in a couple weeks ago for
our<00:00:23.100> HQ<00:00:23.279> pack<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.090> it'll<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.539> easy<00:00:24.720> I

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
translated it before a few months back
back<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.359> January<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:28.710> really

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
back in January but I don't really

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:40.850 
back in January but I don't really
memorize<00:00:29.220> them<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.630> go

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.380 

now<00:00:41.860> my<00:00:42.010> Japanese<00:00:42.310> isn't<00:00:42.580> perfect<00:00:43.090> so<00:00:43.210> every

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
now my Japanese isn't perfect so every

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.790 
now my Japanese isn't perfect so every
once<00:00:43.570> in<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.720> while<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.900> come<00:00:44.170> across<00:00:44.290> words<00:00:44.650> I

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
once in a while I come across words I

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.590 
once in a while I come across words I
don't<00:00:44.980> know<00:00:45.100> yet<00:00:45.400> luckily<00:00:45.730> shuco<00:00:46.330> camera

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
don't know yet luckily shuco camera

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.790 
don't know yet luckily shuco camera
makes<00:00:46.780> looking<00:00:47.110> up<00:00:47.200> where<00:00:47.350> it's<00:00:47.470> pretty<00:00:47.620> easy

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
makes looking up where it's pretty easy

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.820 
makes looking up where it's pretty easy
as<00:00:48.130> opposed<00:00:48.490> to<00:00:48.580> dojinshi<00:00:49.240> or<00:00:49.630> other<00:00:49.840> manga<00:00:50.230> so

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
as opposed to dojinshi or other manga so

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.740 
as opposed to dojinshi or other manga so
I<00:00:50.890> use<00:00:51.040> G<00:00:51.340> Shock<00:00:51.490> comm<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:52.030> look<00:00:52.150> up<00:00:52.270> words<00:00:52.420> I

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
I use G Shock comm to look up words I

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.150 
I use G Shock comm to look up words I
just<00:00:52.960> type<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.380> there<00:00:53.560> and<00:00:53.740> it<00:00:53.860> pops<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
just type it in there and it pops the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.370 
just type it in there and it pops the
meeting<00:00:54.490> and<00:00:54.640> then<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.630> just<00:00:55.780> slide<00:00:56.200> that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
meeting and then I can just slide that

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:09.360 
meeting and then I can just slide that
meeting<00:00:56.680> right<00:00:56.860> into<00:00:57.070> my<00:00:57.160> translation

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.200 

cleaning<00:01:10.370> is<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.580> second<00:01:10.910> step<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
cleaning is the second step of the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.820 
cleaning is the second step of the
process<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.690> usually<00:01:12.170> takes<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.530> most<00:01:12.680> time

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
process and usually takes the most time

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.590 
process and usually takes the most time
right<00:01:13.430> now<00:01:13.550> I'm<00:01:13.700> pretty<00:01:13.880> lucky<00:01:14.060> since<00:01:14.450> I

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
right now I'm pretty lucky since I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.970 
right now I'm pretty lucky since I
already<00:01:14.720> rotated<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.260> scans<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.740> made<00:01:15.830> them

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
already rotated the scans and made them

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.710 
already rotated the scans and made them
black<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.250> white<00:01:16.400> when<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:16.550> scan<00:01:16.790> them<00:01:16.940> in<00:01:17.060> but

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
black and white when I scan them in but

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.790 
black and white when I scan them in but
removing<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.170> tux

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
removing a tux

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.470 
removing a tux
takes<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.160> bit<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.430> work<00:01:19.520> as<00:01:19.850> you'll<00:01:20.030> see<00:01:20.210> here

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
takes a bit of work as you'll see here

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:33.300 
takes a bit of work as you'll see here
in<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.630> second

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.640 

now<00:01:34.180> this<00:01:34.360> is<00:01:34.479> where<00:01:34.659> things<00:01:34.690> get<00:01:34.990> tricky<00:01:35.049> as

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
now this is where things get tricky as

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.410 
now this is where things get tricky as
you<00:01:35.950> can<00:01:36.070> see<00:01:36.250> some<00:01:36.520> of<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.670> text<00:01:36.940> goes<00:01:37.119> over

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
you can see some of the text goes over

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.180 
you can see some of the text goes over
on<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.690> skirt<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.680> we're<00:01:38.799> going<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.950> need<00:01:39.100> to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
on the skirt so we're going to need to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.770 
on the skirt so we're going to need to
get<00:01:39.280> rid<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.760> without<00:01:40.119> getting<00:01:40.450> rid<00:01:40.720> of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
get rid of that without getting rid of

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.080 
get rid of that without getting rid of
the<00:01:40.900> skirt<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:42.070> I'm<00:01:42.220> going<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.400> use<00:01:42.580> Photoshop

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
the skirt so I'm going to use Photoshop

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.030 
the skirt so I'm going to use Photoshop
clone<00:01:43.509> tool<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.049> draw<00:01:44.229> over<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.740> remaining

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
clone tool to draw over the remaining

00:01:45.040 --> 00:02:31.089 
clone tool to draw over the remaining
text

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.039 

letme<00:02:31.879> rebels<00:02:32.269> use<00:02:32.420> patterns<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.989> the

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
letme rebels use patterns in the

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.440 
letme rebels use patterns in the
background<00:02:33.499> so<00:02:33.890> I'll<00:02:34.249> just<00:02:34.459> close<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.909> notes<00:02:35.180> -

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
background so I'll just close it notes -

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.899 
background so I'll just close it notes -
they're<00:02:35.870> pretty<00:02:36.079> easy<00:02:36.430> sometimes<00:02:37.430> with<00:02:37.819> these

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
they're pretty easy sometimes with these

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.149 
they're pretty easy sometimes with these
backgrounds<00:02:38.540> they're<00:02:38.659> kind<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.930> hard<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.590> make

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
backgrounds they're kind of hard to make

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.679 
backgrounds they're kind of hard to make
look<00:02:40.340> natural<00:02:40.849> like<00:02:40.879> right<00:02:41.299> now<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.510> can

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
look natural like right now you can

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:42.910 
look natural like right now you can
totally<00:02:41.810> tell<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.409> pulled<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.709> clone

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
totally tell that I pulled the clone

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.039 
totally tell that I pulled the clone
stamp<00:02:43.069> over<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.549> stuff<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.569> when<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.900> put

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
stamp over this stuff but when you put
