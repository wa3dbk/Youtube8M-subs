00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
there I'm going to leave that in just

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
there I'm going to leave that in just
for<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> hell<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.680> running

for the hell of it if you're not running
a<00:00:50.039> secondary<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.120> work<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> have

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
a secondary it will not work so you have

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
a secondary it will not work so you have
to<00:00:52.620> run<00:00:52.800> some<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> pistol<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.940> overkill

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to run some kind of pistol or overkill

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080 
to run some kind of pistol or overkill
or<00:00:54.750> something<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> most<00:00:56.640> likely<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
or something that is most likely the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.189 
or something that is most likely the
problem<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.570> most<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> guys<00:00:57.930> are

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
problem that most of you guys are

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
problem that most of you guys are
experiencing<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.940> recommendations<00:01:00.570> for

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
experiencing as for recommendations for

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
experiencing as for recommendations for
this<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> run<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> reflex<00:01:02.760> perk<00:01:03.059> just

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
this I like to run the reflex perk just

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
this I like to run the reflex perk just
because<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> makes<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.960> pick<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> gun

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because it makes you pick up the gun

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
because it makes you pick up the gun
faster<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.280> well<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.519> swap<00:01:05.790> faster<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.479> that's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
faster as well as swap faster but that's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
faster as well as swap faster but that's
entirely<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.400> thought<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> best

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
entirely up to you I thought the best

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.050 
entirely up to you I thought the best
game<00:01:09.630> mode<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.470> free<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.890> all

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
game mode for this was free for all

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.550 
game mode for this was free for all
it'll<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.150> slightly<00:01:12.450> easier<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.170> encounter

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it'll be slightly easier to encounter

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.109 
it'll be slightly easier to encounter
the<00:01:13.590> guy<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> picked<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.490> his<00:01:14.580> weapon<00:01:14.939> as

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the guy that you picked up his weapon as

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
the guy that you picked up his weapon as
opposed<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> having<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.500> teammate<00:01:16.830> kill<00:01:17.040> him

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
opposed to having your teammate kill him

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
opposed to having your teammate kill him
every<00:01:17.340> time<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> team-based<00:01:18.750> mode<00:01:19.320> so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
every time in a in a team-based mode so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
every time in a in a team-based mode so
