00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.219
 this tablet blog.de I'm degree in 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.769
 asus at the ces in las vegas and the 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.290
 have presented the asus send from 6 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.950
 a new 6 inch tablet 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.060
 we do not know a fan of such big ones 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.650
 That's why we want that for smartphones 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.110
 now take a closer look 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.690
 There will be several variants of 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.260
 given asus his six 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.550
 Actually only give the data first 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.730
 It should appear in Germany there 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.770
 would cost about 300 euros and from 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.480
 The second quarter roughly seems like that 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.450
 that's certainly all 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.610
 have not said a six now 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.900
 inch big display and the resolution 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.329
 lies at 1280 x 720 pixels is an ips 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.420
 Display around your eyes are the angles 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.350
 also do well accordingly 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.840
 an internet mz 2580 processor of at 2 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.100
 gigahertz clocked and it will be in 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.740
 the German version in any case 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.539
 Two gigabytes of RAM are available 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
 but will probably models with only 1 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.039
 give gigabyte Operative memory 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.600
 besides, we have different ones 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.259
 memory options for selection but with 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.299
 eight of the 16GB flash memory and up 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.280
 the backside you can also here 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.950
 remove the cover and then one 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.890
 micro sd card into it and we have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.979
 by the way also two possibilities 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.960
 have his smartphone with the wheels 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.819
 do not know if the corner tools and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.649
 function then also in Germany 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.860
 the market comes we will 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.799
 see if it's good so far we go 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.369
 times around the asus sn of 6 we have around 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.670
 up here a 2 megapixel camera then 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.560
 below the three typical android buttons 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.079
 13 megapixels on the back at the end 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 Camera with LED flash and on 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.720
 speakers then here are above 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.060
 audio input speaker is connected to the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.390
 page as well as the power button below 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.840
 in the micro usb connection and that's it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.789
 already 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.500
 the back that looks a bit like that 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.959
 but it is not aluminum at all 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.060
 aluminum but plastic with a 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.620
 ceramic layer on it feels like it 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 but pretty high quality 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.380
 So you would not think that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.600
 So plastic is so 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.480
 I think it's pretty well processed 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.810
 it really only cost around 300 euros 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.040
 becomes 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.099
 then a nice alternative to that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.439
 samsung galaxy note 3 for example that 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.069
 I have here you see again 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:41.500
 the courses differed from 57 inches 6 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.200
 it should not be so much, but that is zen 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.790
 6 is a bit higher and higher 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.370
 also minimal rider good on this level 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.560
 support 4.3 jelly bean but it should 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.560
 timely update on android 4.4 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.799
 give kitkat and on android lies the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.500
 new asus zenbook the sec we looks like 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.150
 see here the new bar has become 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.590
 in comparison to the previous july of 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.079
 asus done a lot 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 that looks very nice here now 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.079
 here we see about the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.180
 design has changed a bit 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.120
 attracts quite chic in any case 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.590
 well so far that this is so useful 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.609
 and six definitely makes one 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.109
 good first impression 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.700
 I hope it really comes to fruition 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.530
 Germany as I said the price is 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.870
 probably at around 300 euros 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.560
 I am at the many for tablet blog.de 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.560
 thanks for seeing
