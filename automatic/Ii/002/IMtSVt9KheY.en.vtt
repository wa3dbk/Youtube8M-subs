for<00:00:29.460> her<00:00:29.579> so<00:00:29.790> I<00:00:29.849> thought<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> might<00:00:30.300> want<00:00:30.480> to

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.560 
for her so I thought you might want to
see<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> process<00:00:31.200> and<00:00:31.410> how<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.570> this

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
see the process and how I do it so this

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900 
see the process and how I do it so this
is<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.980> look<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
is what it's going to look like in the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
is what it's going to look like in the
end<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.300> hope<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> see<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> real<00:00:37.260> well

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you see if I can zoom up on that says

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.130 
you see if I can zoom up on that says
start<00:00:41.550> each<00:00:41.880> day<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.840> birthday

and so that's the sign i'm going to be

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
and so that's the sign i'm going to be
making<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.380> what<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.560> did<00:00:46.860> first<00:00:47.310> of<00:00:47.490> all<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.760> i

computer and then in my computer i
printed<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.330> full-size<00:00:57.330> it's<00:00:57.990> 30<00:00:58.650> x<00:00:58.890> 20<00:00:59.340> so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
laid out on their full size so now the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810 
laid out on their full size so now the
next<00:01:08.820> thing<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.820> lets

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you have 3 times 4 12 pieces of paper so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
you have 3 times 4 12 pieces of paper so
each<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.259> small<00:01:16.439> segment

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.529 
each one of them is just a small segment
and<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.359> side<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.469> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
and on the side there is a little bit of

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.830 
and on the side there is a little bit of
edge<00:01:21.869> where<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:23.179> printer<00:01:24.179> doesn't<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.659> all

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
edge where the printer doesn't go all

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
edge where the printer doesn't go all
the<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.229> edge<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:25.560> paper<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.460> what

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the way to the edge of the paper so what

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.450 
the way to the edge of the paper so what
I'm<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.179> do<00:01:27.450> first<00:01:27.749> is<00:01:28.139> cut<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
this is I can line it up exactly where

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.440 
this is I can line it up exactly where
it<00:01:41.130> goes<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:43.579> can<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.759> exactly<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.359> I'm

down with a piece of tape like so and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.160 
down with a piece of tape like so and
then<00:02:11.069> I'll<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.760> take<00:02:12.360> those<00:02:12.630> two<00:02:13.020> together

want to use this paper again and the
ball<00:04:11.320> tip<00:04:11.820> rolls<00:04:12.820> real<00:04:13.090> nice<00:04:13.300> on<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.780> paper<00:04:14.140> so

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
ball tip rolls real nice on the paper so

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.699 
ball tip rolls real nice on the paper so
what<00:04:15.370> I'm<00:04:15.460> going<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:15.640> do<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:16.000> apply<00:04:16.270> pressure

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
what I'm going to do is apply pressure

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.520 
what I'm going to do is apply pressure
right<00:04:17.709> where<00:04:18.010> each<00:04:18.840> outline<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.870> each<00:04:20.200> shape

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
right where each outline of each shape

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.400 
right where each outline of each shape
is<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:21.040> around<00:04:21.280> each<00:04:21.580> fall<00:04:21.910> circle<00:04:22.480> and<00:04:22.690> around

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
is so around each fall circle and around

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.250 
is so around each fall circle and around
each<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.190> letters<00:04:24.400> here<00:04:25.030> i<00:04:25.180> will<00:04:25.510> just<00:04:25.780> put

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
up can you see that where it transferred

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.330 
up can you see that where it transferred
onto<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.830> board<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:52.660> where<00:04:53.310> where<00:04:54.310> I

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
onto the board just where where I

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.000 
onto the board just where where I
outline<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.300> lead<00:04:56.020> transfers<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.770> paint
