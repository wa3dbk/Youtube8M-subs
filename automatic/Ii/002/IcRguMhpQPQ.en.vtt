 Celery actually in the industry section 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.980
 I know it's a clump of the worker 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.396
 She said she heard it was the bulb but the onion was like 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.900
 I'm not the one who signs bombs with a foul smell here 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.359
 Hey, celery 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.759

 Do you feel down? 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.199
 I think I do not see the idea 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.800
 The idea of ​​what? Laugh on celery? 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.076
 Any one I talk to is cut off 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.910

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.155
 One will take celery and not see it again 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.080
 Take celery? 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.860

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.240
 O man, all know that you are a hunter 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.880
 Hee, did you understand me, O Orange? He is a stalker 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.911

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.620
 Do you know why you are not fun? 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.039
 Because I sit next to an onion? 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.292
 You smell it, you must deal with it my friend 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.759
 Yes, maybe - the rabbit - maybe? 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.240
 This is not the orange I know 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.959
 The orange I knew was to say 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.179
 Sour onions with small onions 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.239
 Small onion 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380
 Haha it's a fact because it's a rhyme 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.456

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.779
