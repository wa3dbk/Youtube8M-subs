00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.230
 this turtle can find in the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.070
 Progress beaches in Cal Petén and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.530
 originally at sea number 13 of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.680
 yucalpetén with engineer america them 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.470
 they were retained they kept it in their 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.800
 facilities until we had 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.810
 the call to heal nat to be able to go to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 make a clinical evaluation is that this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.090
 animal had a bruise on the skull 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.690
 which caused fracture of the part 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.420
 superior and in this area where was the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.300
 fracture and a double layer reigned breasts in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.039
 air spaces which broke 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 just the top layer but that's not 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.170
 integrated by inner layer however 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 by the type of injury we assume that this 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 it could have been caused by the blow 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.809
 of a propeller in a boat 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.269
 and we were sure that driving 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.739
 produced injury to the brain mass to 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.480
 despite the injury that could have 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.280
 stayed in the brain that is permanent 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.259
 the injury is not enough to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.300
 sacrifice it we see ourselves through the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.399
 swimming studies that he was made to 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.640
 see that he can coordinate the movements 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.470
 breathing boxing that are all 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.210
 the activities that the brain coordinates 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 There is enough data to release it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.240
 to try to readapt the animal 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.250
 to his condition but in freedom 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.159
 he was effectively in captivity and in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.020
 trade treatment this turtle 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:57.240
 this copy was received a year ago 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:02:00.119
 the month of May remember that you were 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:16.320
 produced a very serious exposed wound 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:18.420
 that they even showed up right now is a 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.120
 beautiful copy that is in full 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.390
 productive maturity this 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.610
 animal is approximately 40 years old and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.879
 you are in this species your life 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.379
 reproductive exceeds 70 80 years are 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.920
 animals that come to live much more than 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.230
 80 years and that is the state that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.659
 we return to their habitat from the optimum 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.299
 you observed opening like the 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.150
 turtle are god remembered first 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.260
 He toured his land and barely had a list 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.959
 he went to the deepest he was deposited in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.879
 one on a reef known as lorena 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.329
 that are a ship's decision to create 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.349
 precisely reefs 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.480
 because it meets the right conditions 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.180
 in terms of depth in terms of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.760
 food conditions these these that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.400
 the white turtles are are in dollars 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.240
 that feed on marine grass from 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.820
 algae and there is created in the habitat 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 ideal for this turtle can 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:24.610
 finish your recovery and we can 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:27.460
 see soon again when effectively 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.120
 it's a white turtle is one of the two 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.460
 species that go down aguilar to yucatán that 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.530
 is in serious danger of extinction and 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.110
 also the people we mark in a fin 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.770
 so you can identify yourself 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.530
 later, it is opportunely 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.290
 giving in this time in which the thing 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.820
 We are in the middle of the nesting period and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.700
 I think with the support of all of you 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.330
 we can definitely help us is 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.520
 we are grateful that Yucatan remains 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.850
 they have their properties on the coast so that 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.760
 when they detect a turtle that goes 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.770
 to represent their eggs we give them the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.030
 conditions not only mentor we fish 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.320
 this function that turtles have 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.630
 but we want the conditions 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.300
 that if we are at the moment 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.820
 they are going down they are arriving 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.100
 let's call the phones of the week 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.780
 let us know so they can collect the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.730
 eggs and deposit them better 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.450
 in the eight tortuguero fields that 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.950
 we have in the whole coast and that with this 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.200
 awareness of all Yucatecans 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.000
 can we preserve this species 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.000
 which is in danger of extinction
