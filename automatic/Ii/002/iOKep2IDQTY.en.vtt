00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.059
 the dvv antwerp marathon can count on 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.519
 great running weather almost immediately to the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.480
 start without 4 runners wondering about 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.609
 jesse stroobants 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 floran bald and lander van droogenbroeck 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 and gino van geyte 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.600
 gino van geyte is the first to roll 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.130
 release the five-time Belgian champion 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 can't follow the pace of jesse 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.359
 stroobants that serves as a hare 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.340
 when a moment later also lander of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.430
 we still have to see droogenbroeck 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.460
 two tokens for straw strokes and bald 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.460
 and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.450
 as provided with step jesse stroobants 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.040
 just about half way from the race 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 he is confident that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 flora and bald and the limit for the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 Olympic Games in Rio 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 I am very impressed 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 have been able to drop him on earth 26 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.489
 that's a mile more than that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 optimum 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.480
 and even 5 km more is required in between 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.149
 be the trail of the front runner 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.100
 no less than 2400 other runners 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.100
 busy with their own marathon 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260
 to avert 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.650
 so can steal tracks a dirty one 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.050
 vascular hummingbird facile 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.370
 taking said fan plus the mouth may 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.370
 also whether you will 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 what were we two really glittering 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.840
 have been lucky 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 the clamp I understand it was raining now but there 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.900
 so circumstances are not good 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
 we can't put on the back to is 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.369
 were perfect and poorly done 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.640
 I had to it is and remains a hard one 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.979
 42km running technique this completely different 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.540
 because there are so many people to see around hours 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 well 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.560
 if I went alone I might already have 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.300
 even more apart than no compiÃ¨gne 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.740
