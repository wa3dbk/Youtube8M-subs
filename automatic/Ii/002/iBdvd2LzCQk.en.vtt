00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.350
 these have become 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.210
 next to the rainwater collectors and even open highs that flow into

 the lake of Valencia has had its mass of water due to the waters 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 that supplies the populations of valencia

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.160
 added to this is the existence of an industrial park 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.600
 which is also a permanent source of pollution due to the discharge of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 waste at the source 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.500
 the amount of toxic accumulated since the time of the province in the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.580

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.350
 they have compromised him the 7 giant giants 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.950
