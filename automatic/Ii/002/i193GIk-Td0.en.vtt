right<00:00:32.989> now<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> simulation<00:00:34.980> very

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
right now for the simulation very

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
snake you can kind of see the pattern I

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.320 
snake you can kind of see the pattern I
hope<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.240> shows<00:01:16.270> up<00:01:16.570> good<00:01:16.720> on<00:01:16.750> Phil<00:01:18.330> very

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.830 
all right
I'm<00:01:42.700> gonna<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.030> all<00:01:43.119> from<00:01:43.270> five<00:01:43.570> feet

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
I'm gonna do it all from five feet

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.870 
I'm gonna do it all from five feet
roughly<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.979> distance<00:01:45.130> you'd<00:01:45.429> be<00:01:45.550> shooting

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
roughly the distance you'd be shooting

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.050 
roughly the distance you'd be shooting
at<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.030> snake<00:01:46.270> if<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.600> stumbled<00:01:47.350> upon<00:01:47.410> one<00:01:48.060> now

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
at a snake if you stumbled upon one now

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.570 
at a snake if you stumbled upon one now
I<00:01:49.090> got<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.509> say<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:49.899> if<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.770> was<00:01:50.950> five<00:01:51.310> feet

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
I got to say this if I was five feet

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.100 
I got to say this if I was five feet
away<00:01:51.700> from<00:01:51.820> snake<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.509> would<00:01:52.750> just<00:01:52.869> get<00:01:53.020> away

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
away from snake I would just get away

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.749 
away from snake I would just get away
from<00:01:53.289> it<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.679> would<00:01:53.860> not<00:01:54.009> shoot<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.399> we're<00:01:54.580> just

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
from it I would not shoot it we're just

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.850 
from it I would not shoot it we're just
testing<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.240> ammo<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.810> for<00:01:56.410> what<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.619> see

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
testing this ammo and for what I can see

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.790 
testing this ammo and for what I can see
so<00:01:57.069> far<00:01:57.310> it's<00:01:57.550> pretty<00:01:58.140> poor<00:01:59.140> as<00:01:59.500> far<00:01:59.709> as

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
so far it's pretty poor as far as

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.839 
so far it's pretty poor as far as
effectiveness<00:02:00.369> but<00:02:00.610> let's<00:02:01.479> see<00:02:01.569> what<00:02:01.690> happens

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
effectiveness but let's see what happens

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.949 
effectiveness but let's see what happens
all<00:02:03.849> right<00:02:03.940> five<00:02:04.119> feet<00:02:04.300> away<00:02:04.420> I'm<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:04.780> right

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
all right five feet away I'm going right

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.180 
all right five feet away I'm going right
for<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.170> heads

instead of shooting at the the met the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.050 
instead of shooting at the the met the
center<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.439> circle<00:02:26.680> each<00:02:27.519> one<00:02:27.760> has<00:02:27.939> at

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
center of the circle each one has at

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.490 
center of the circle each one has at

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
standing on the thing to make it work

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.520 
standing on the thing to make it work
