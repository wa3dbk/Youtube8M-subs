00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.680
 good the anarchic doors and windows 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.109
 are the elements that represent us 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.380
 the full and empty of our modeling 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.710
 our virtual model 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.040
 in these icons these software items 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.279
 they are very simple very basic consists of 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.160
 two clicks to install them the only thing is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.310
 what 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.380
 can be parameterized and basically in 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.360
 this consists of these tools that 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.640
 they are very simple but they are necessary 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.010
 how do we install a door like this 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 let's go a window basically it 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.160
 install the same 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.470
 the way to use them is very similar 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 we are going to create wall walls and then a 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.809
 floor and let's see what it consists of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 door door has the definition box 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 is a little broader than what we have 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 seen as it opens the libraries and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.059
 shows us the modeling of the door in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.370
 the right side of the box 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.670
 definitions we see the parameters 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.550
 basic the height the width and here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.770
 We can observe the door in different 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.320
 perspectives or in plant how are you going to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 represent in the parameters the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.710
 parameters are therefore what we can 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.930
 edit of this door 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.050
 Well the basics of knowing how to edit 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.909
 an opening in 2d and 3d as the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.759
 representation of the angle of the door 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.710
 is here in two of her here in three of 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.710
 the next tab are the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.390
 definitions of the door in basically 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.020
 these definitions of the door we 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.290
 shows as the detail of the drawing 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.810
 we could edit it if we want but by 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.360
 defect is very well remember that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.630
 this software this basis of the standards 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.149
 from the pnv erc 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.380
 we can add in this on this disk 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.119
 a door definition a hand 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 here opposite therefore usually 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.100
 will always come out nothing click and 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.220
 we look for the hand that we want and 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.819
 we give ok how can we install the door 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.709
 We click the wall we get an angle 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.390
 of vision towards where we want to see towards 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.130
 where we want the door is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.959
 oriented out base in of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.580
 how is this inward and how do we give it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.650
 the direction of the sense the door 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.150
 then we turn the mouse to where 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.030
 we want 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.920
 and open in this case we're going to turn towards 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.549
 the top of the screen let's say 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.950
 a second clip and this is all for 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.290
 install the door and the windows 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.560
 they are basically the same 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.860
 let's look at the window 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.710
 The power definition is very similar 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.810
 only parametrized and then never forget 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.450
 save the favorites and the window is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.770
 too edited because this avoids us the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.330
 work to do it again we give an ok 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.580
 we are going to locate a window next to the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.000
 door we click and do where is 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.730
 orient 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.239
 we look and modeled and this is basically 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.210
 in our door and window this too 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.630
 can be dictated in a 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.510
 3 of we select the door and here 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.930
 we can tell you that you are not going to have a 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.080
 different height will be open in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.470
 3-d for example at 45 degrees then 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.840
 we are here 45 ok and so we can be 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.710
 editing our default door 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.200
 all come with wood then with 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.870
 pine wood if you want to be a door in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.480
 aluminum at the bottom are 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.190
 materials here we can edit the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.080
 materials of our door 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.690
 Finally, as favorites, I insist a lot 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.870
 with favorites because then this is not going 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.040
 to help save time and work in 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.209
 modeling 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.500
 a separate item can be already as for 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.780
 those who work on walls 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.300
 inclined 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.430
 how can we use it then let's say 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.850
 For example, you will have a great creation 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.209
 of 75 degrees we already have our very 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.420
 inclined we place a window in the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.200
 wall and now let's look at the elevation that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.549
 it happened we have the burj inclined to ok 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.009
 here the window is used 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.449
 this was already parameterized and to use 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.880
 but usually it's always going to come out 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.370
 90 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.009
 usually these windows if not 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.319
 we click where it says plane height 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.119
 it says attached to the wall or vertical so 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.979
 regular or default will always be 

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:37.270
 so vertical will always leave us 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.129
 so what we have to do is 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.860
 precisely come by definitions and 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:44.199
 tell him we do not want to cause the wall 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.510
 let's say an ok and this is the way to use 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.060
 windows and doors to the walls 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.490
 and basically this is all that 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.490
 we have to know for 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.270
 and install doors and windows in a 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.560
 an arctic three-dimensional modeling 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.199
 I hope you have served something because it is 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.360
 something too basic but it can be 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.990
 relevant for those who do not 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.569
 they had knowledge of this software already 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.780
 We know how to install the window and so 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.639
 how to install doors and edit them 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.580
 then please give a like and if there 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.550
 some concern comment and nothing because 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.229
 same as always practice up to one 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.860
 next time when I'm left with something 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.860
 free time
