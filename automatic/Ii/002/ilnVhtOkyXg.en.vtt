00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.930 
right there we're almost done and it's
go<00:02:20.020> ahead<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:21.010> line<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.370> motion<00:02:21.670> where<00:02:21.820> her

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
go ahead the line of motion where her

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.620 
go ahead the line of motion where her
head<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.940> we're<00:02:25.060> treating<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.450> like

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
head is so I'm we're treating it like

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.000 
head is so I'm we're treating it like
it's<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.840> round<00:02:26.050> object<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.770> kind<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
it's a round object and you can kind of

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.710 
it's a round object and you can kind of
see<00:02:27.220> makes<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.850> little<00:02:28.150> object<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.540> little

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
see makes that little object a little

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.530 
see makes that little object a little
bit<00:02:28.840> round<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.459> will<00:02:30.640> come<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.910> here<00:02:31.239> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
bit round and so will come in here and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.990 
bit round and so will come in here and
we<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.070> we'll<00:02:33.220> use<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.760> find

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
we have that so we'll use that to find

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.440 
we have that so we'll use that to find
where<00:02:34.570> our<00:02:34.780> hair<00:02:35.700> split<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.180> comes

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
where our hair split is so it comes

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.260 
where our hair split is so it comes
along<00:02:37.780> there<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.110> her<00:02:38.200> hair<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.620> cut<00:02:38.830> around

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
along there and her hair is I cut around

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.090 
along there and her hair is I cut around
and<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.360> comes<00:02:40.570> over<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.140> she<00:02:41.800> has<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.010> a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
and it comes over here she has like a

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.300 
and it comes over here she has like a
pigtail<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.790> we'll<00:02:43.390> use<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.660> circle<00:02:44.250> kind<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
pigtail and we'll use a circle kind of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.380 
pigtail and we'll use a circle kind of
met<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.520> out<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> be<00:02:46.239> really

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
met that out it's going to be really

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.000 
met that out it's going to be really
light<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.840> don't<00:02:47.020> might<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.560> be<00:02:47.680> able<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.860> see

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
light I don't might not be able to see

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.190 
light I don't might not be able to see
it<00:02:48.070> on<00:02:48.130> camera<00:02:48.160> I'm<00:02:48.970> using<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:50.080> know

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
it on camera I'm using that so you know

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.710 
it on camera I'm using that so you know
does<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.820> appear<00:02:51.820> too<00:02:51.970> much<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.239> my<00:02:52.330> final

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
does it appear too much of my final

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
you're drawing with me and pan when you

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.250 
you're drawing with me and pan when you
scan<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.489> we<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.750> know<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.050> do

some<00:02:59.440> settings<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.070> can<00:03:00.370> make<00:03:00.610> those

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
some settings and you can make those

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.220 
some settings and you can make those
lines<00:03:00.970> pretty<00:03:01.209> much<00:03:01.390> disappear<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.110> what<00:03:02.200> I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
lines pretty much disappear so what I

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.150 
lines pretty much disappear so what I
recommend<00:03:02.430> would<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.880> um<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.070> if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
recommend would be is um you know if

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.850 
recommend would be is um you know if
you're<00:03:06.280> going<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.430> draw<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> pen<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.770> ahead

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
you're going to draw a pen just go ahead

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.500 
you're going to draw a pen just go ahead
when<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.160> scan<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.730> there's<00:03:10.390> some

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
when you scan it in there's some

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.479 
when you scan it in there's some
settings<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:10.989> can<00:03:11.080> do<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.560> take<00:03:12.340> away

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
settings that you can do to take away

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.280 
settings that you can do to take away
