00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 to 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.039
 it's not the first time I have this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.959
 device in my hands but samsung 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.389
 it made us wait so long since 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.460
 they announced it until they released it and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 I had forgotten how it was and this time 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 I had more time to inspect it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
 hello how are you, I'm vanessa hand 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.289
 orellana for cinema in Spanish and today they 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.800
 I have the first look at the samsung 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 galaxy s 5 in aspects it looks a lot like 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.140
 to the first 4 disappointment insist with 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 keep the same plastic cover 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 which in my opinion makes it look less 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 luxurious especially after seeing the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 ladies and one m8 aluminum 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.810
 difference is that this is about 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.780
 small holes that remind us of the texture 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.880
 of a band-aid also added two 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 colors to the collection will now come in 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.200
 exaggerated blue and gold plus black 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 and white like this if you want to look 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.670
 with a gold you will have to wait because 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 Not all colors will be available 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 in all markets at least 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.049
 principle the amoled screen is a bit 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 larger than that of s 4 is 5.1 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.030
 inch HD 1080p 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.230
 just like the previous one looks pretty 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 sharp but 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.270
 you will not notice the big difference between this one 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 and the s4 and below the screen the button 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 of startup rather the sensor of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.210
 fingerprints to unlock the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.880
 phone but they also did the function 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.650
 more useful allying with paypal in 26 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.290
 markets so you can do your 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.910
 shopping by just swiping your finger on 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.890
 concept is good but reality is 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.380
 another because you have to do it very 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.940
 carefully for you to work another 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 What I show you is that now the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.740
 micro usb slot is sealed and that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
 is because the s5 is resistant to water and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.660
 to dust eye that is not completely 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 submersible but maybe if you hold on 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.340
 dip in the toilet the camera is one 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.770
 of the strengths of this phone 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.560
 now it has a 16 megapixel sensor 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.040
 with autofocus and stretches 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.260
 automatic and video in the jr of 1080 p 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.000
 You can also manipulate the focus 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.970
 after taking the photo to give it a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.640
 professional effect to your photos and if you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.350
 they like the selfish this function is for 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.050
 you the 2 megapixel front camera 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.840
 It will make your skin look resplendent 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.860
 because it fixes all the imperfections 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.560
 Of course you can 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.750
 but I found it fun to also record 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.870
 1080p video and your skype calls 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 they come out clearly another novelty is this 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.910
 sensor below the camera that measures the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.890
 heart rate just do not put your finger 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.840
 it's the most practical function but if you're 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.000
 living your physical activity can be 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.700
 useful because it is synchronized with the app 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.300
 self inside comes with the mega 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.250
 quad-core processor snapdragon 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.880
 801 of qualcomm and the latest version of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.980
 android kitkat 4.4 will no longer see the button 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.080
 of physical menu because it is now 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.610
 on the screen and it also has 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.350
 differences in the interface of the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.830
 adjustments for example but we continue 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.709
 having that 2 is voice is flat and other 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.989
 samsung applications and a function 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.209
 useful that has the s5 that does not have the s4 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.010
 is the battery saving mode that 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.410
 allows to perform only functions 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.050
 basic phone but promise more 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.660
 Charging hours if you're in a hurry the 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.350
 s5 is now available in the usa with 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.920
 tint sprint and t-mobile and verizon messiah 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.650
 and being a leader costs 650 dollars 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 or 200 dollars in contract and you can 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.700
 add up to 128 gb more with a card 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.860
 microsd in conclusion is an evolution 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.630
 of the 4th and not the revolution that I 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.849
 I expected has some functions 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.819
 interesting but for me that design 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.590
 remains a great disadvantage for the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.380
 same price you can buy the ultra 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.090
 powerful is shewan m 8 that is worth the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.800
 sorry to consider I'm vanessa hand 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.050
 orellana for cinema in Spanish and this has 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.680
 been your first look at the samsung galaxy 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.680
 s 5
