00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.690
 any serial I've done with your 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 GrÃªmio is already very sweet but any serial 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 without sugar it will get tasty a spoon 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 of margarine soup or if you do not 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.950
 have hose had house you can use 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.420
 butter and a teaspoon of essence 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.040
 vanilla 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 if you do not have the essence of vanilla 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.140
 also will not hurt the stove 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 average temperature will maintain and retain 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 the margarine the stove needs to be in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.159
 The average temperature for margarine 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.110
 burn if you burn you need to start it all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.990
 again because in gasoline you get 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.780
 It tastes terrible when I think she 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.439
 completely melted add 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.810
 the vanilla and remove from the heat 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.810
 there you will add from your history 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.200
 m well is tactile is completely the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.260
 top you will see that the business looks good 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.290
 care is even on a board 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.050
 set up well again with butter 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.870
 You're going to vote for the heavenly psb I like 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.640
 to use this one that is small square but 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.450
 You can use any size 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.940
 when you get to that point that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.640
 is in its shape 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.160
 You're going to need to knead it to stay. 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.330
 All together I like to just look at 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.960
 Take my hand and squeeze it so do not squeeze 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.780
 in hand 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.770
 other people like to use the hand 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.070
 painted with butter or margarine 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.890
 I prefer only the bag because then the same 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.830
 made without adding more butter to 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.560
 folder was not there when you 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.290
 point you'll let it cool and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.070
 when the male honey harden is just cut 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.070
 to enjoy 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.420
 I hope you liked this 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.420
