00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
initially you'll create whipped cream

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
initially you'll create whipped cream
but<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> want<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> bypass<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.250> soft<00:00:53.550> and

but you want to bypass the soft and
stiff<00:00:54.420> peaks<00:00:54.750> stages<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> milk

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
stiff peaks stages so that the milk

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
stiff peaks stages so that the milk
solids<00:00:57.149> separate<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> buttermilk<00:00:58.620> if

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
solids separate from the buttermilk if

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
solids separate from the buttermilk if
you're<00:00:59.550> doing<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:00.210> hand<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.750> want

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you're doing this by hand you just want

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.889 
you're doing this by hand you just want
to<00:01:01.350> shake<00:01:01.680> until<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> lump<00:01:03.390> forming

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to shake until you see a lump forming

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:23.850 
to shake until you see a lump forming
leaving<00:01:04.680> behind<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.309> trail<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.909> liquid

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.040 

next<00:01:24.730> you<00:01:24.850> want<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.060> take<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.270> strainer<00:01:25.780> and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
next you want to take a strainer and

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.590 
next you want to take a strainer and
drain<00:01:26.500> out<00:01:26.680> as<00:01:26.920> much<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:27.580> buttermilk<00:01:28.420> as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
drain out as much of that buttermilk as

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.660 
drain out as much of that buttermilk as
possible<00:01:29.230> so<00:01:29.650> you're<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:29.950> separating<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
possible so you're just separating the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:42.310 
possible so you're just separating the
milk<00:01:30.940> solids<00:01:31.180> from<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.050> buttermilk

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.440

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
to wash it of its excess buttermilk any

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.640 
to wash it of its excess buttermilk any
extra<00:01:50.910> buttermilk<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.630> decrease<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> life

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
extra buttermilk will decrease the life

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.520
