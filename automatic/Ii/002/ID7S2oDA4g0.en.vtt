00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.470 
silicone out of the way a little bit but
it<00:03:32.720> still<00:03:32.930> fits<00:03:33.079> just<00:03:33.350> fine<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:35.180> an

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
it still fits just fine so that's an

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.390 
it still fits just fine so that's an
advantage<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.959> silicone<00:03:36.530> cases<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.280> you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
advantage to silicone cases is that you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.240 
advantage to silicone cases is that you
could<00:03:37.519> use<00:03:37.730> pretty<00:03:37.970> much<00:03:38.060> any<00:03:38.209> sort<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:39.250> USB

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
could use pretty much any sort of USB

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.520 
could use pretty much any sort of USB
cable<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.260> bottom

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
cable that you like so that's the bottom

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.190 
cable that you like so that's the bottom
of<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.739> case<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.430> front<00:03:43.900> completely<00:03:44.900> open

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
of the case on the front completely open

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.140 
of the case on the front completely open
it<00:03:45.440> doesn't<00:03:45.739> cover<00:03:45.890> like<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.160> top<00:03:46.489> portion<00:03:46.820> or

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
it doesn't cover like the top portion or

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.760 
it doesn't cover like the top portion or
the<00:03:47.180> bottom<00:03:47.390> portion

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
the bottom portion

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.370 
the bottom portion
and<00:03:49.300> it<00:03:50.300> does<00:03:50.510> have<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> nice<00:03:50.870> lay<00:03:51.110> on<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.320> table

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
and it does have a nice lay on the table

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.720 
and it does have a nice lay on the table
design<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.310> lay<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.700> table

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
design so you can lay it on the table

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.280 
design so you can lay it on the table
and<00:03:53.150> your<00:03:53.270> screen<00:03:53.480> will<00:03:53.600> be<00:03:53.630> lifted<00:03:54.050> up<00:03:54.140> a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
and your screen will be lifted up a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.740 
and your screen will be lifted up a
little<00:03:54.530> bit<00:03:54.760> now<00:03:55.760> on<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.150> back<00:03:56.390> we<00:03:56.600> have<00:03:56.630> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
little bit now on the back we have a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.930 
little bit now on the back we have a
good<00:03:56.990> cut<00:03:57.230> out<00:03:57.350> for<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.680> camera<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.640> flash

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
good cut out for the camera in the flash

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.760 
good cut out for the camera in the flash
and<00:03:59.330> I<00:04:00.020> don't<00:04:00.170> know<00:04:00.230> if<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.500> see<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.650> on

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
and I don't know if you can see it on

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.740 
and I don't know if you can see it on
the<00:04:00.890> camera<00:04:00.920> but<00:04:01.250> they've<00:04:01.490> actually<00:04:01.700> put<00:04:02.510> like

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
the camera but they've actually put like

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.740 
the camera but they've actually put like
a<00:04:02.780> little<00:04:02.870> black<00:04:03.260> lining<00:04:04.300> right<00:04:05.300> there<00:04:05.510> so

a little black lining right there so

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.420 
a little black lining right there so
that<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.500> don't<00:04:06.680> run<00:04:06.830> into<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.160> sort<00:04:07.370> of

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
that you don't run into the sort of

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.890 
that you don't run into the sort of
flash<00:04:07.700> problem<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> lot<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.540> people<00:04:08.630> are

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
flash problem that a lot of people are

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.450 
flash problem that a lot of people are
having<00:04:09.080> where<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.500> flash<00:04:09.710> reflects<00:04:10.190> back

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
having where the flash reflects back

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.610 
having where the flash reflects back
into<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.790> camera<00:04:11.030> too<00:04:11.300> much<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:12.440> that's

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
into the camera too much so that's

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.260 
into the camera too much so that's
definitely<00:04:12.890> good<00:04:13.370> thing<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.730> haven't<00:04:13.910> had<00:04:14.060> any
