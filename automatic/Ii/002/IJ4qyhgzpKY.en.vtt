use<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.659> toggle<00:00:04.259> Mouse<00:00:04.680> look<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.279> Guild<00:00:05.580> Wars<00:00:05.730> 2

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
use a toggle Mouse look in Guild Wars 2

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.810 
use a toggle Mouse look in Guild Wars 2
since<00:00:06.660> there<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> no<00:00:07.170> option<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:09.059> game

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
since there is no option to in the game

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.879 
since there is no option to in the game
we're<00:00:11.820> using<00:00:12.000> synapse<00:00:12.570> 2.0<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.559> if<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we're using synapse 2.0 so if you have a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.540 
we're using synapse 2.0 so if you have a
razor<00:00:14.099> mouse<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:14.880> work<00:00:15.000> otherwise<00:00:16.550> you

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
razor mouse this will work otherwise you

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.750 
razor mouse this will work otherwise you
will<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.390> find<00:00:18.600> something<00:00:18.840> else

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
will have to find something else

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560 
will have to find something else
alright<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.090> under<00:00:21.960> mouse<00:00:22.650> customize<00:00:23.570> you

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
alright so under mouse customize you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.779 
alright so under mouse customize you
create<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> new<00:00:25.529> profile<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.189> yourself<00:00:26.550> so

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
create a new profile for yourself so

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.370 
create a new profile for yourself so
that<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.090> doesn't<00:00:27.390> occur<00:00:27.869> when<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.289> in

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
instead my computer is just bugging out

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.990 
instead my computer is just bugging out
okay<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.070> how<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.820> back<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
okay you see how it's going back and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
forth real quick here when you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.140 
forth real quick here when you
right-click<00:02:35.940> again<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:37.410> should<00:02:37.650> stop

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:03:01.190 

eventually

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.069 

there<00:03:01.830> goes
