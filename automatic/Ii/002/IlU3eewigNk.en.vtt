00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 episodes of the griffin series 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.760

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.500
 cracked cam as well participated in the 23rd 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.809
 episode in which we are in fact 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 we managed to play this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.140
 faction that will be one of the most factions 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 great let's say no bigger but with a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.340
 loot absurdly kids the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.080
 worse who goes to the server 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.820
 practically my writing and it was 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.590
 infiltrated this faction is a lot 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 rich note of this server that big 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.829
 party I need in which I never play 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.690
 but in fact my writing has me 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.550
 invited me called he said he has 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.559
 found something really very beautiful 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 to be redone only by the owners of the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.420
 faction pusher didn't allow it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.860
 to open the baskets practically everything 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.899
 that territory that pyres me gods 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 diamonds was all wrong 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.629
 he practically couldn't do it for the baskets 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.090
 in placing blocks in that territory 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.340
 he could only pour blocks 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.649
 up to the limit where you see these tnt 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 he couldn't April let's say the baskets 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.600
 but thanks precisely to the cannons of nt that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 They were not even of guns lt Us 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.830
 managed to really take all the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 the contents of the baskets were really 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.540
 full of computer armor I get ready 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 started to widen and guys like me 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.750
 I told you on this server there 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 I almost never play and I didn't 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.439
 not even an f or a small one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.450
 little house where to place everything 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.640
 this booty but only now the first i 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.189
 first objects that I had just taken the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 we put black in the lander and then boys 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.939
 I went outside and said let's say 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 some double basket with 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.780
 placed all the loot precisely without 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.430
 don't even cremate us guys first 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.520
 precisely we had to burst 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 lnt say this way precisely 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.899
 we could only place the tnt in that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 point because we say he couldn't 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.890
 place TNTs nowhere else 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.540
 ass was the best point the point 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 more strategic than I could remember 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 open the baskets and I died a couple of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.140
 times at the beginning but really the booty 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.420
 it was absurd server where I didn't even play 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.009
 really got so much stuff 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
 for really made you feel bad 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.270
 however, boys are not cared for 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.640
 this time for more than a week 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.459
 we say yes a week of absence and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.789
 oh well guys let's say there are the holidays 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.860
 there is summer 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.260
 is to upload video and the thing 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.510
 better that I have to do though than me 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.640
 brought the same video I promise you there 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 I will upload many more videos anyway 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.239
 even if I don't know there are only vacations 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.400
 which glÃ¬ in a few days 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.950
 leave on vacation will miss another 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.200
 time let's say for a week 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.879
 but precisely before the vicars leave 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.500
 it was still a couple of videos if I can 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.450
 let's say within four days I should 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.579
 maybe leave two more videos there 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.439
 load before it starts even if I have to 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.139
 tell the truth I prefer to say 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.450
 come back after a break I know of one 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.700
 week later I really do you a lot 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.099
 more loads with more desire and I believe you 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.370
 comments are much more beautiful 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.109
 better it is already a leaven better I don't know if 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.870
 you noticed these videos girls 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.090
 post briefing comment on the usage 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.030
 precisely to speak not of the designer 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.099
 we talk about the designer but let 's say the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.620
 half of the things I say have nothing to do with it 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.269
 just nothing with the theme of the video and not 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 I know maybe he 'll have to start doing vlog 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.189
 why do we say these video posts 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.329
 commentaries nor the heart I tell you things that 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.060
 they have nothing to do with new members 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.340
 where it will seem strange to you guys 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.169
 if you want other designer sign up on 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.750
 my channel boys you will find so many 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.819
 brand of factions and what the fuck I am 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.109
 saying oh guys you are seeing in 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.729
 background we say what we have 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.229
 burned what we managed to 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.389
 take without the help of others 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.489
 players who intervened after that 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.829
 it is however I believe that it is truly a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.500
 gigantic loot just for what 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.930
 we really managed to take a 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.180
 really, really big loot 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.859
 and the boys to take the other party 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.750
 lead decided to sell all the 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.940
 armor a part of the shipowner who 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.220
 they took and we say one of the money 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.889
 made by selling armor we had in 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.019
 mind buying a spooner mood from 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.359
 creeper but given that spooner of grip 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.370
 it was the most expensive thing about us 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.889
 we are two let's say we were forced 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.189
 to invite these two people who were 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.569
 revolution and who or if I think so 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.340
 they really helped us out 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.349
 lots of money just to buy 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.329
 this shores that when he was half 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:17.279
 million was really a thing 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.579
 absurd is practically the background is 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.919
 exploded 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.990
 I had the placed was below the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.060
 baskets I went to check the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.279
 shore there was just that as seen it 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.460
 spawn had exploded in front of learning 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:34.479
 current entry was an epic thing 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.159
 debated at the same time that 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.260
 know the same time is operating 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.810
 laughter because you ca n't because 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.950
 it costs half a million it was gone we say 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.169
 that is, he lost his cock only thinking about it 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.510
 guys still want to laugh at this 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.820
 the biggest thread we say about this 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.800

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.580
