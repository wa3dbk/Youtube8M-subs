00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
come in but whatever and so yeah it was

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.750 
come in but whatever and so yeah it was
just<00:00:55.260> terrible<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.520> low

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
just terrible it was like very low

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
just terrible it was like very low
temperature<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.719> wind<00:00:57.960> chill<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.230> was

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
temperature and with wind chill it was

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.889 
temperature and with wind chill it was
negative<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.949> walking<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.629> fun

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
negative so walking that is just not fun

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.680 
negative so walking that is just not fun
so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.559> guess<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> wrong<00:01:02.789> time<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.300> watching

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so I guess the wrong time to be watching

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
so I guess the wrong time to be watching
this<00:01:03.780> video<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.530> since<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.159> like

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
this video would be now since it's like

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
this video would be now since it's like
a<00:01:05.460> lot<00:01:05.760> nicer<00:01:06.030> than<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:07.049> going

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a lot nicer than it was like going

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
a lot nicer than it was like going
outside<00:01:07.500> without<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.130> jacket<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.880> nice<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.540> mean

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
outside without a jacket is nice I mean

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
outside without a jacket is nice I mean
I<00:01:10.020> guess<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.830> not<00:01:10.920> recommended<00:01:11.520> because

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
I guess it's not recommended because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
I guess it's not recommended because
it's<00:01:11.939> still<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.299> thirty<00:01:12.689> degrees<00:01:13.049> but

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it's still like thirty degrees but

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.010 
it's still like thirty degrees but
whatever<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:15.090> anyways<00:01:15.600> I've<00:01:15.810> rambled
