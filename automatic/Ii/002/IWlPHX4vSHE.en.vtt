 getting back in contact with the ball by jumping an obstacle is a 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.160
 completely different ball that I was not used to because this 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.810
 this contact being very good 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.320

 I spend a lot of time together 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.650
 only now had as partner and 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.850
 It is more of a motivation than waiting to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.150
 a great double life very run 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.510
 the front center scheduling 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.930
 and joked that some have already done all these attacking functions by the side 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380
 right the attacker on the left 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.940
 jarratt office like centroavante and related as a half field 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.040
 from the moment I feel good physically I can feel at ease 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.700
 to do any of these functions 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.580
 in them beijing 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.810
 How are we going to work? 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.510
 we did not encourage very well physically and after the next evaluation we are going 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.640

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.630
 we talk about this 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.070
 I'm not afraid he says that Professor Vanderlei works very well about it. 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.200
 of this 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.410
 not all of us have this awareness that 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.710
 everyone will have to do their best to conquer 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.960
 and something this year so everyone is very motivated 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 and everyone is very aware of what we have to do bpi leads 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.670
 a group that is neither well known nor 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.720
 nash by the way of being also generated 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.170
 It seems like we have clarified a lot of time. 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 so I'm very happy for the adaptation going very fast 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.250
 and now it is to give continuity and I hope that this is of cgu 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.510
 I made 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.710
 I made many friends and not only companions.
