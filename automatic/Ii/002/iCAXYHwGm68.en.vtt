00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello to all of space the doctor 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.830
 white we are here today with a new video 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.990
 dedicated to fifa 14 users the review 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.790
 of a determined team footballer who he is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.679
 released last Wednesday the player more 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.450
 strong of this strong team 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.789
 I'm talking about wayne rooney before 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.770
 begin thank you will mean equal to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.660
 facebook is called adams patch then 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 probably not the real name indeed 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619
 surely he loaned it to me yesterday 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 evening I played with this player and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 it's really incredible statistics 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 are absurd rooney flag of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.100
 manchester united this year the team 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.510
 he played very badly however he was 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 saved was one of the best if not 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 the best of the team along with de 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.200
 therefore really statistics 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.579
 interesting evaluation 92 we begin 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 our review talking like 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.420
 always of speed speed which is not 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.690
 not bad for a playmaker 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 it would be enough to have a speed of 70 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.039
 we only think of three midfielders like 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.629
 totti in shape that is probably one 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 of the best are the best series a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.210
 more than 80 cuirone then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.930
 you already understand that it is excellent for what 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 it's about speed 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.580
 acceleration is very good what 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.200
 surprising is the physical strength and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 aggression because it has a 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.490
 very high value therefore when he has the ball 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.330
 and is launched towards the speed door 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.950
 maxim 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 you will hardly be able to steal it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.939
 ball sometimes passes even half two three 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 defenders and prepared as nothing goes to 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.540
 recover ball as soon as you lose it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.650
 in this respect really 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.060
 great 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.820
 the only thing that can give a little trouble 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 is the fact that high warner high 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.280
 what does it mean that for him he will run all over 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 the game looks back and forth 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.030
 almost as very high because 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.130
 it really runs much more than horses too 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.750
 back to help her team often do it 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 it is also found as a median in front of the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.149
 defense 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 so maybe at the end the game will be 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.710
 really tired and hardly 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.600
 you will be able to give your best with his 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 race for the rest really good for 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
 as for the shot I would start from 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 this clip to talk to him about the best 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.840
 shooting I've ever tried on the team e 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.060
 so far so much better than 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.460
 christian ormando this is incredible 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.930
 player I have no image 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.700
 what could be the first twelve 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.190
 team has dressed not gone not dressed 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.350
 all people who have more than 95 96 of 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.550
 shot or even his alex coming 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.830
 with Lorraine for a seventh loan 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.810
 they will be crazy Rooney players 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.030
 at 93 shooting then a value already 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.739
 exceptional and look what to do 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.940
 pulls from 40 meters and puts it 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.330
 in the corner where the porter cannot 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.400
 arrive 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.930
 then of the piero from the distance 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.550
 phenomenal probably one of the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.350
 best I've ever tried 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.790
 I'll probably want to bring you a tutorial 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.890
 on how to do the long shot with i 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.230
 players since they are still anyway 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 very spectacular goal the thing I have 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.110
 noticed that surprised me is the fact that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.030
 don't need to take the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.380
 run-up to pull large broadsides 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.769
 from outside the area look in this case 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.160
 practically at rest he turns and takes the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.440
 sight 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.360
 throws a ball that the goalkeeper can't 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.010
 learn because first directly 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.110
 at the corner look at this too 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.150
 case from outside the area the shot goes 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.890
 perfectly in the corner and in the door 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.840
 there was so much boredom one of the best 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.910
 goalkeepers of the game really for how much 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.700
 regards the rooney shot has none 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.530
 weak point also four stars le 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.650
 weak so he can pull quietly 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.170
 also of left I must say that the shot 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.880
 precision is not the top because why 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.200
 so much enough to throw power for 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.299
 so I didn't even score 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.760
 need to resort to shooting 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.860
 really shooting accuracy is the best 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.450
 among those tested so far net 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.010
 improvement regarding the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.100
 drilling compared to its basic version 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.290
 it is able to go half way to it 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.829
 23 bersani thanks to the excellent agility 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.989
 the excellent dribbling sin only for the 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.850
 three stars is he had all 4 and 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.560
 we would be talking about a player again 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.690
 more phenomena than it is now 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.220
 however, even contrasts succeed 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.049
 quietly to leave in the middle of 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.880
 several opponents 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.350
 the very good passage does not boast of 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.310
 so great pass for a 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.870
 playmaker 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.310
 I didn't do so many passages because 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.410
 because in the mere e cs I am 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.450
 focused on him as a playmaker 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.579
 that was always going to pull him shot of 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.290
 head is not bad though if you use like 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.940
 you will not go practicing three-quarter 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.829
 never to exploit since it is difficult 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.500
 will be in the air to hit the ball of 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.600
 head that you're recommending me or engines 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.489
 in this case speed passage e 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.880
 dribbling or even the basic one 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.700
 why 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.710
 already very strong with the statistics of 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.790
 base then go to increase them all and 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.340
 will become a phenomenal player 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.110
 it really doesn't serve any purpose 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.150
 lots of money for maybe soccer player val 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.520
 the more you are, the stronger you are 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.750
 in the basic version where to use i 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.690
 two errors first of all 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.790
 comes out as a trequartista so as you are looking for 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.250
 I can advise you or as ati in 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.990
 this 4 set live team born from fake 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.540
 nine common homes are also details 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.880
 a lot of thoughts in more runes can download 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.490
 simply the ball behind or anyway 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.170
 stand in front of the door and pull from 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.730
 distance the important know less 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.440
 use rooney as a tip because i have 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.760
 since it doesn't make me so much you 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.620
 I recommend putting it lightly 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.870
 back the tip because why so 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.850
 will have open field where to load the shot 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.570
 and mark easily 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.470
 or a 4 2 3 1 in this case we have 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.050
 to the armani and van that you don't 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.480
 they will never return to the defense but have 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.160
 allowed tourè matrix that are fixed 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.440
 in defense because they have a medium to high of 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.840
 warcraft and we have runes that serve as points 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.330
 of conjunction between the attack and the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.740
 midfield then this position with 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.510
 dominant because it will always be at the center 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.100
 of the game can pass then pull then 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.260
 dribbling opponents can do everything 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.670
 in that position conclusion flights ha 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.970
 a good speed the shot is 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.210
 simply crazy 4 star foot 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.010
 weak good agility excellent passages la 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.010
 physical strength and aggression are al 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.870
 top and if you have no problems with high 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.540
 word high yes I personally don't have 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.510
 had he is the best playmaker 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.270
 possible on fifa 14 meeting are the 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.430
 three skin stars and the high work high 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.190
 whereas some may be annoying 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.830
 surely among cavani less damon ceroni 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.070
 there is no rooney comparison all my life 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.770
 really an incredible player 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.090
 the only problem is the price at the moment 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.650
 700 thousand credits but they are all really worth 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.050
 the coast contacts as you well know 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.670
 much, much poorer then with 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.010
 each concluded me with topics in the comments 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.540
 if you have already tried some decisions e 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.070
 were satisfied if you maybe have 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.210
 found in the package if you bought 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.410
 on the market 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.350
 we will probably see each other again soon 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.540
 Sunday with the review of a silver 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.830
 of the season team is a player 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.760
 that I want to bring you because really 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.350
 awesome 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.350
 we will proceed hello soon
