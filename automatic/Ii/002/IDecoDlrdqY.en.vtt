00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.250

 when winning the competition I obtained the card 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.330
 of professional something that was very emotional 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.170
 because his mother died a few days before 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.170
 the competition 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.490
 1992 would be the year of its confirmation in 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.340
 the elite of bodybuilding achieving 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.440
 adjudicated in light of the champions and 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.290
 being second nothing more and nothing less 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.710
 that in the olympic coach in his first 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.710
 participation 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.610
 when kevin lebron was savoring 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.020
 the honeys of success in the spring of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.020
 1993 the chest was torn 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 but the next year I saw lebron 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.540
 He came back stronger than ever 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 winning arnold classic and san jose 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.239
 pro 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.360
 when you are in the scenarios of the fm 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.170
 all effort was worth it is a 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.170
 incredible moment 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.120
 one day a boy approached me in the absence of 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.790
 two weeks for Mr. Olympia 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.879
 we trained together arm asked me 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.400
 I said yes then I realized that 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.560
 I had to be in class the boy 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.510
 he explained that he had problems with his father 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 I had a talk with him 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.790
 years later I read in a magazine a 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.760
 article titled as kevin lebron 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.860
 saved my life in this boy 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.610
 He related that day he had thought about 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.610
 commit suicide 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.380
 then I knew bodybuilding is a lot 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.380
 more than muscles 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.109
 kevin lebron continued to reap successes in 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.749
 his bodybuilding career managing to stay in 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.560
 four times in second position on 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:04.609
 olympic coach and having won 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.499
 practically all of the 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.499
 professional titles 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.949
 kevin lebron trained with the system 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.949
 icy dilemma and I started 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.910
 a method that brought him 22 victories in 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.910
 the professional field 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.310
 but kevin lebron it was a rara avis 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.500
 I did not diet by volume alone 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.620
 increased his caloric feat for the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.620
 competition reaching to increase 15 kilos 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.860
 the steroid intake was focused on 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.560
 the xxi clean that allows you to gain weight in 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.620
 short periods of time inflating the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.680
 muscle tissue useful to obtain 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.860
 harder muscles and avoid effects 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.370
 serious side effects except for the pain of 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.370
 injections 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.620
 kevin lebron decided to retire in the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.820
 2003 leaving behind a career 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.820
 full of successes 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.990
 lebron was recognized as the mister 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.990
 olimpia without crown 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.900
 once removed and removed from the 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.570
 competition 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.260
 kevin lebron focused on his great passion 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.260
 the music 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.419
 from the hand of producer milton cachelas 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.180
 kevin lebron begins his career in the 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.180

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.650

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.699
 a remarkable success 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.650
 kevin lebron needed to remain linked 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.370
 to bodybuilding somehow 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.500
 in May 2010 he lent his image and his 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.500
 name for a line of supplements 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.770
 kevin lebron derived revenue as a legend 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.770

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.270
 far away videos of 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.520
 training where lebron was proud of 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.520
 an extraordinary physical form 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.050
 the ginormous physique product of 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:46.820
 massive intake of anabolics has given 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.820
 earthly physical step 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.600
 but it should not be forgotten the huge 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.750
 importance that bing left in the 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.360
 body-building 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.210
 as a sample remember the words of 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.590
 sanding and after seeing kevin lebron 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:12.840

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.840
