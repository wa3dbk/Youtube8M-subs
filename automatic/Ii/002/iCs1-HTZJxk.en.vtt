you need to go to person for and some

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.199 
you need to go to person for and some
people<00:01:21.170> don't<00:01:21.319> like<00:01:21.700> talking<00:01:22.700> about<00:01:22.910> that

people don't like talking about that

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.059 
people don't like talking about that
because<00:01:23.390> it's<00:01:23.660> like<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.319> tall<00:01:24.530> poppy<00:01:24.709> thing

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
because it's like the tall poppy thing

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.520 
because it's like the tall poppy thing
you<00:01:25.280> know<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.819> wrap<00:01:26.330> yourself<00:01:26.479> or<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.110> don't

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
you know you wrap yourself or you don't

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.650 
you know you wrap yourself or you don't
get<00:01:27.679> to<00:01:27.860> cut<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.250> away<00:01:28.369> with<00:01:28.640> yourself<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:29.119> we

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
get to cut it away with yourself but we

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.150 
get to cut it away with yourself but we
need<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.959> do<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.259> because<00:01:30.590> otherwise<00:01:30.800> you

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
need to do that because otherwise you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.490 
need to do that because otherwise you
don't<00:01:31.310> find<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:31.670> out<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.360> can<00:01:32.390> assume<00:01:32.899> but

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
don't find that out you can assume but

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.960 
don't find that out you can assume but
you're<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.830> only<00:01:34.099> one<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.340> knows<00:01:34.610> what<00:01:34.849> your

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
you're the only one that knows what your

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.699 
you're the only one that knows what your
strengths<00:01:35.300> are<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.780> day<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.050> day<00:01:36.170> basis<00:01:36.679> we

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
strengths are on a day to day basis we

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.809 
strengths are on a day to day basis we
had<00:01:37.539> sometimes<00:01:38.539> dozens<00:01:39.319> of<00:01:39.649> fires<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.459> put<00:01:40.610> out

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
had sometimes dozens of fires to put out

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.690 
had sometimes dozens of fires to put out
and<00:01:41.470> problems<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.560> solve<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.250> they<00:01:43.340> had<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.610> be

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
and problems to solve and they had to be

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.180 
and problems to solve and they had to be
solved<00:01:44.030> very<00:01:44.270> very<00:01:44.479> quickly<00:01:44.720> indeed<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.830> it

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
solved very very quickly indeed so it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.040 
solved very very quickly indeed so it
was<00:01:46.310> made<00:01:46.610> very<00:01:46.910> very<00:01:46.940> clear<00:01:47.119> from<00:01:47.630> the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
was made very very clear from the

management<00:01:48.830> right<00:01:49.039> from<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> start<00:01:49.640> that

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
management right from the start that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.089 
management right from the start that
there<00:01:50.030> would<00:01:50.119> be<00:01:50.149> no<00:01:50.420> blame<00:01:51.110> games<00:01:51.470> assigned

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
there would be no blame games assigned

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.219 
there would be no blame games assigned
to<00:01:52.250> any<00:01:52.399> other<00:01:52.640> departments<00:01:53.209> basically<00:01:53.959> we

to any other departments basically we

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.669 
to any other departments basically we
were<00:01:54.380> often<00:01:54.590> encouraged<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.459> admit<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:57.110> any<00:01:57.470> of

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
were often encouraged to admit to any of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.440 
were often encouraged to admit to any of
the<00:01:57.890> technical<00:01:58.789> problems<00:01:58.910> we<00:01:59.330> were

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
the technical problems we were

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.010 
the technical problems we were
experiencing<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.500> rather<00:02:01.190> than<00:02:01.690> all<00:02:02.690> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
experiencing and rather than all the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.440 
experiencing and rather than all the
impetus<00:02:03.530> being<00:02:04.039> put<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.399> one<00:02:04.610> person<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.239> solve

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
impetus being put on one person to solve

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.100 
impetus being put on one person to solve
that<00:02:05.630> problem

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
that problem

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.690 
that problem
it<00:02:06.289> became<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> team's<00:02:07.009> problem<00:02:07.459> to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
it became the team's problem to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.160 
it became the team's problem to
collectively<00:02:08.119> work<00:02:08.360> together<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.899> solve

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
collectively work together and solve

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.500 
collectively work together and solve
that<00:02:09.349> particular<00:02:09.619> issue<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:10.429> quite<00:02:11.120> often<00:02:11.270> we

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that particular issue so quite often we

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.270 
that particular issue so quite often we
be<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.780> situation<00:02:12.319> where<00:02:12.500> we'd<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.189> in

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
be in a situation where we'd all be in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.240 
be in a situation where we'd all be in
the<00:02:13.370> room<00:02:13.549> troubleshooting<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.599> particular

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the room troubleshooting one particular

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.890 
the room troubleshooting one particular
and<00:02:15.580> we<00:02:16.000> knew<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.210> we<00:02:16.480> weren't<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.840> to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and we knew that we weren't going to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.490 
and we knew that we weren't going to
leave<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.230> room<00:02:17.470> until<00:02:18.840> one<00:02:19.840> two<00:02:20.110> or<00:02:20.260> three

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
leave that room until one two or three

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.290 
leave that room until one two or three
different<00:02:20.830> solutions<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.460> been<00:02:21.490> suggested

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
different solutions have been suggested

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.180 
different solutions have been suggested
and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:22.870> later<00:02:23.080> implemented<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.010> that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
and then later implemented so that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.620 
and then later implemented so that
worked<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.940> number<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.210> different<00:02:25.360> levels

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
worked on the number of different levels

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
worked on the number of different levels
not<00:02:25.990> only<00:02:26.230> did<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.440> provide<00:02:26.560> us<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.070> some

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
not only did it provide us with some

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.280 
not only did it provide us with some
really<00:02:27.520> useful<00:02:27.790> insights<00:02:28.420> from<00:02:28.810> other

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
really useful insights from other

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.990 
really useful insights from other
departments<00:02:30.070> who<00:02:30.190> could<00:02:30.370> feed<00:02:30.610> into<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
departments who could feed into the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000 
departments who could feed into the
process<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.930> also<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.320> helped<00:02:32.590> develop<00:02:32.890> an

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
process but also it helped develop an

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.860 
process but also it helped develop an
incredible<00:02:33.430> sense<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.970> teamwork<00:02:34.240> we<00:02:34.630> were<00:02:34.750> all

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
incredible sense of teamwork we were all

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.810 
incredible sense of teamwork we were all
in<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.140> together<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.250> wasn't<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.700> a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
in it together and it wasn't just a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.280 
in it together and it wasn't just a
question<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.750> know<00:02:37.780> some<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
question of you know some of the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.560 
question of you know some of the
departments<00:02:39.060> relaxing<00:02:40.060> because<00:02:40.240> one

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
departments relaxing because one

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.730

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
problem it really helped to engage the
