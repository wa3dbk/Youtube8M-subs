00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
otherwise tech specs are pretty much

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.939 
otherwise tech specs are pretty much
identical<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.929> let<00:00:31.080> me<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.349> run<00:00:31.590> down

70<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.070> lacking<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.329> that's<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
70 which was lacking that so that's a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
70 which was lacking that so that's a
little<00:00:51.840> bit<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.260> advantage<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
little bit of an advantage but this is a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
little bit of an advantage but this is a
bigger<00:00:53.489> device<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> should<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:54.870> least

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
bigger device so it should have at least

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.410 
bigger device so it should have at least
one<00:00:55.469> additional<00:00:55.739> perk<00:00:56.160> beyond<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:57.239> more

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one additional perk beyond a little more

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.470 
one additional perk beyond a little more
real<00:00:57.750> estate<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> screen<00:00:58.949> also<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> want

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
real estate for the screen also I want

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
real estate for the screen also I want
to<00:01:00.539> point<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.559> viewing<00:01:02.100> angles<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to point out this viewing angles on this

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.270 
to point out this viewing angles on this
screen<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.719> slightly<00:01:04.379> inferior<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
screen are slightly inferior to that of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
screen are slightly inferior to that of
the<00:01:05.610> 70<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.360> sure<00:01:06.600> exactly<00:01:06.869> why<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.260> don't

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the 70 I'm not sure exactly why I don't

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.469 
the 70 I'm not sure exactly why I don't
think<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> has<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.400> pixel<00:01:08.850> density<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
think it has to do with pixel density I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
think it has to do with pixel density I
think<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> matter<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.580> they're

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
think it's more a matter of that they're

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
think it's more a matter of that they're
simply<00:01:12.150> maybe<00:01:12.720> getting<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> panels<00:01:13.530> from

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
simply maybe getting the panels from

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
simply maybe getting the panels from
different<00:01:14.010> sources<00:01:14.340> did<00:01:15.000> read<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.689> stuff

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
different sources did read some stuff

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.469 
different sources did read some stuff
online<00:01:16.280> pertaining<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.759> panel<00:01:18.119> being

might<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.720> why<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.110> seeing<00:01:25.259> some<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
might be why we're seeing some of the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
might be why we're seeing some of the
poor<00:01:25.799> viewing<00:01:26.100> angles<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
poor viewing angles but I don't want it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.410 
poor viewing angles but I don't want it
anyway<00:01:27.780> disparage<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> screen<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> really

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
anyway disparage the screen and really

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
anyway disparage the screen and really
here<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> whole<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.890> still<00:01:32.189> have

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
been really impressed with it and it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
been really impressed with it and it
really<00:01:35.549> doesn't<00:01:35.820> take<00:01:35.939> away<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.450> the

the<00:02:18.020> potential<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:19.310> device<00:02:19.760> now<00:02:20.290> let's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the potential of this device now let's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.290 
the potential of this device now let's
get<00:02:21.470> into<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.830> actual<00:02:22.220> product<00:02:22.819> itself<00:02:22.880> as

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
get into the actual product itself as

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.030 
get into the actual product itself as
you<00:02:23.390> can<00:02:23.510> see<00:02:23.630> I've<00:02:23.720> gotten<00:02:24.050> gadget<00:02:24.500> up<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.830> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you can see I've gotten gadget up here I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.710 
you can see I've gotten gadget up here I
have<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.580> say<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.790> have<00:02:26.090> noticed<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.569> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
have to say I have noticed that the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780 
have to say I have noticed that the
Wi-Fi<00:02:27.170> even<00:02:27.980> though<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.580> same

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
Wi-Fi even though they have the same

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.449 
Wi-Fi even though they have the same
internal<00:02:29.120> specs<00:02:29.540> has<00:02:30.110> been<00:02:30.470> responding<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
internal specs has been responding a

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.280 
internal specs has been responding a
little<00:02:31.970> bit<00:02:32.090> better<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.390> getting<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.780> stronger

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
little bit better on getting a stronger

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.990 
little bit better on getting a stronger
signal<00:02:33.620> out<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.069> this<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.370> think<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.610> probably

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
signal out of this I think that probably

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.430 
signal out of this I think that probably
has<00:02:35.360> more<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:36.110> with<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> fact<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
has more to do with the fact that the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.870 
has more to do with the fact that the
arrogant<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> design<00:02:40.100> internally

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
arrogant and the design internally

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.670 
arrogant and the design internally
probably<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.480> playing<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.840> larger<00:02:42.170> factor<00:02:42.560> in

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
probably is playing a larger factor in

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.370 
probably is playing a larger factor in
that<00:02:42.860> than<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.060> actual<00:02:44.420> internal<00:02:44.930> since<00:02:45.260> they

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that than the actual internal since they

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.770 
that than the actual internal since they
are<00:02:45.500> identical<00:02:46.000> screen<00:02:47.000> also<00:02:47.510> more

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
are identical screen also more

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.229 
are identical screen also more
responsive<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.650> finding<00:02:49.250> pinch-to-zoom<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:50.150> be

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
responsive a finding pinch-to-zoom to be

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.210 
responsive a finding pinch-to-zoom to be
the<00:02:50.360> best<00:02:50.600> I've<00:02:50.840> seen<00:02:50.870> even<00:02:51.410> better<00:02:51.590> than<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
the best I've seen even better than the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.280 
the best I've seen even better than the
70<00:02:52.640> even<00:02:52.790> though<00:02:52.970> again<00:02:53.090> it's<00:02:53.750> supposed<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.110> be

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
70 even though again it's supposed to be

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.500 
70 even though again it's supposed to be
identical<00:02:54.830> hardware<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:55.880> am<00:02:56.120> impressed

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
identical hardware so I am impressed

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.970 
identical hardware so I am impressed
with<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.720> let<00:02:57.080> me<00:02:57.200> show<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.440> loading<00:02:57.860> up

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
with that let me show you loading up

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.580 
with that let me show you loading up
another<00:02:58.250> page<00:02:58.580> again<00:02:59.269> no<00:02:59.510> flash<00:02:59.810> support<00:03:00.290> here

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
everything about the device and I do

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900 
everything about the device and I do
find<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.560> 10-inch<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.100> be<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> completely

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
find the 10-inch to be a completely

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.550 
find the 10-inch to be a completely
different<00:03:29.060> experience<00:03:29.690> than<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.989> 70<00:03:30.380> since

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.090 
could just throw in some video so you
guys<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:11.989> see<00:04:12.140> what<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.410> performance<00:04:12.950> is

like

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.610 

[Music]

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
[Music]

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.060 
[Music]
and<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:26.000> enough<00:04:26.390> of<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.570> as<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.590> can<00:04:27.710> see<00:04:27.770> it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
and so enough of that as you can see it

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.160 
and so enough of that as you can see it
pretty<00:04:28.250> much<00:04:28.520> will<00:04:28.820> just<00:04:29.030> bring<00:04:29.300> up<00:04:29.480> on-screen

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
pretty much will just bring up on-screen

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.250 
pretty much will just bring up on-screen
controls<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:31.130> little<00:04:31.580> bit<00:04:31.670> of<00:04:31.760> lag<00:04:31.910> there<00:04:32.260> but

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
controls a little bit of lag there but

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.710 
controls a little bit of lag there but
that<00:04:33.440> resolves<00:04:33.920> itself<00:04:34.190> pretty<00:04:34.520> much<00:04:34.720> lets

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
that resolves itself pretty much lets

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.410 
that resolves itself pretty much lets
you<00:04:35.840> take<00:04:35.990> us<00:04:36.170> home<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:37.610> mean<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:38.090> far<00:04:38.150> I'm

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
you take us home and I mean so far I'm

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.150 
you take us home and I mean so far I'm
pretty<00:04:38.630> impressed<00:04:38.780> again<00:04:39.230> I'm<00:04:39.620> not<00:04:39.800> running

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
pretty impressed again I'm not running

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.240 
pretty impressed again I'm not running
anything<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.670> here<00:04:40.910> yet<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.890> control<00:04:42.890> task

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
anything on here yet to control task

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.330 
anything on here yet to control task
management<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.780> if<00:04:45.260> you<00:04:45.440> see<00:04:45.620> any<00:04:45.770> lag<00:04:46.040> that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
management so if you see any lag that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.550 
management so if you see any lag that
might<00:04:46.550> be<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.820> blame<00:04:46.970> but<00:04:47.690> everything<00:04:48.200> all<00:04:48.380> in

though<00:05:59.510> again<00:05:59.720> the<00:05:59.930> cemani<00:06:00.590> does<00:06:00.770> have<00:06:00.980> a<00:06:01.010> much

though again the cemani does have a much
more<00:06:01.490> solid<00:06:01.760> feel<00:06:02.150> in<00:06:02.390> the<00:06:02.510> hand<00:06:02.750> but<00:06:02.900> that's

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
more solid feel in the hand but that's

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.320 
more solid feel in the hand but that's
because<00:06:03.410> simply<00:06:03.650> more<00:06:04.280> plastics<00:06:04.880> had<00:06:05.090> to<00:06:05.210> be

because simply more plastics had to be

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.850

employed on this build since this is a

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.130
