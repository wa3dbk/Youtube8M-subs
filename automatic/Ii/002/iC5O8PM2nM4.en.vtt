00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.069 
coq10 and then yeah it was like cocktail
napkin<00:01:43.159> engineering<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:43.909> then<00:01:44.509> would<00:01:44.810> get<00:01:44.960> it

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
napkin engineering and then would get it

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.050 
napkin engineering and then would get it
to<00:01:45.200> George<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.829> George<00:01:46.159> was<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.460> draftsman

who would take the time to do all the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.249 
who would take the time to do all the
blueprints<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.549> he<00:01:53.000> George<00:01:53.659> would<00:01:53.780> work<00:01:53.960> here

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
blueprints so he George would work here

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.609 
blueprints so he George would work here
and<00:01:54.409> then<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> set<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.579> what<00:01:55.790> draftsman

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
and then this is a set of what draftsman

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.499 
and then this is a set of what draftsman
