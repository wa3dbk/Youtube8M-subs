00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 Well look, we are in action to the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 bunnies a place where we work the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.670
 traditional cooking among them in the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 famous perota soup that is a dish 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.899
 traditional of Aloe and how rich are we going to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.899
 know how it is made clear 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.110
 how are you giving them a very old dish 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.969
 of which we worked quite our 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.550
 restaurant and he was the savior the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.200
 responsible for preparing not a ration for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 10 people I hope they have 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 what ingredients does it carry? 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.649
 ingredients to make a perota soup 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.219
 they are olive oil potatoes peppers 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.829
 green onion asparagus tomato and a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.870
 good bread cat and to finish the water 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.990
 so to make the soup perota first 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.360
 we passed the potatoes in oil once 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
 that are lodged we remove them we add 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.530
 the onions when the onion is 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.330
 starting to crush cut into the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.270
 same feeling and finally the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.030
 asparagus when those three vegetables are 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.830
 almost poached we add the tomato that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.080
 let's say the most tender opening of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.780
 that comes when the tomato is already 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.270
 pochado we add the water and we put it to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.660
 point of salt before that rehash 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.479
 start to boil add the potatoes 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.509
 this rehash can not boil because 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.420
 the tradition of the perota soup and 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.280
 once the rehash is done 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.730
 we passed the amount of rehash to the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.659
 compact brightness 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.060
 [Music] 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.280
 because it does not boil because if not 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 would leave the scalding greens and not 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.960
 opened the rehash would completely lose 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.729
 faculty of rehash by another trick of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.090
 the perota soup is that at the time of 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.540
 tie we have to take into account 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.599
 that should not come out neither too dry nor wet 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.760
 because it's so bad it's dry 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.410
 that is due to the dry bread that is carried 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.019
 To the bread too wet and over 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.150
 water and as we know the draft we 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.099
 allows moisture to reach all 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.160
 parts of the perota soup that do not believe 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.740
 air bubbles 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.990
 nowhere of the brightness for 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.000
 decorate it we have left some 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.920
 potatoes refried and we 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.360
 we have prepared some strips of 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.160
 fried pepper 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.630
 this is ready and cristÃ³bal 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.640
 when you want, you can take it 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.960
 Well come on let's go for that I hope that 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.640
 I have clients with a way to 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.640
 eat that he chose men 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:05.230
 [Music] 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.230
