00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that day the next day on the field if

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.170 
that day the next day on the field if
you<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.220> use<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> border<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you have to use it to put a border on a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
you have to use it to put a border on a
cake<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> set<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> layer<00:01:28.409> up

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
cake that you're going to set a layer up

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
cake that you're going to set a layer up
there<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.460> thins<00:01:29.729> down<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> longer

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
there because it thins down the longer

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
there because it thins down the longer
it<00:01:30.630> sits<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.530> I'd<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> extra<00:01:32.250> thick<00:01:32.549> if

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it sits so I'd make this extra thick if

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.010 
it sits so I'd make this extra thick if
I'm<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.150> make<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> next<00:01:33.720> day

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I'm going to make it for the next day

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
I'm going to make it for the next day

okay royal never touches oil it's a good

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.930 
okay royal never touches oil it's a good
way<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> remember<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.220> glass<00:02:08.220> bowls<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
way to remember it glass bowls are the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.609 
way to remember it glass bowls are the
best<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.420> my

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
best in my

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.589 
best in my
opinion<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.039> mix<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:10.459> with<00:02:10.640> put<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.330> damp

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
opinion to mix this with put a damp

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.940 
opinion to mix this with put a damp
cloth<00:02:11.690> over<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.349> while<00:02:12.560> you're<00:02:12.709> decorating

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
cloth over it while you're decorating

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.619 
cloth over it while you're decorating
and<00:02:15.190> it'll<00:02:16.190> it'll<00:02:16.489> last<00:02:17.030> through<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.390> whole

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
and it'll it'll last through the whole

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.259 
and it'll it'll last through the whole
project<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.340> hope<00:02:19.640> that's<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.909> good<00:02:20.060> tip<00:02:20.209> for

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
project so I hope that's a good tip for

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.489
