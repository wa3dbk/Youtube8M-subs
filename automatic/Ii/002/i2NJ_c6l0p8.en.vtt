about sustainable frugal living this is
a<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.629> simplistic<00:00:57.899> system<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:59.129> don't<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.609> a

a very simplistic system we don't have a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.830 
a very simplistic system we don't have a
lot<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> gadgets<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:03.359> instance<00:01:03.480> like

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
strain or anything like that we just

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.200 
strain or anything like that we just
took<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> lid<00:01:09.080> as<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.180> cut<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
took the lid as you can see here cut it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.200 
took the lid as you can see here cut it
out<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> jigsaw<00:01:13.760> slightly<00:01:14.760> larger<00:01:15.030> than

out with a jigsaw slightly larger than
the<00:01:15.299> diameter<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> pipe<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.320> put<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the diameter of the pipe we put on a

the diameter of the pipe we put on a
stainless<00:01:17.310> steel<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.229> see

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
stainless steel you know here we can see

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.609 
stainless steel you know here we can see
it<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> stainless<00:01:19.979> steel<00:01:20.119> clamp<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it a stainless steel clamp like a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.560 
it a stainless steel clamp like a
radiator<00:01:22.890> type<00:01:23.189> clamp<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.060> piece<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> garden

system<00:02:18.079> here<00:02:18.319> where<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:18.680> don't<00:02:18.829> use<00:02:19.249> that<00:02:19.400> much

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
system here where we don't use that much

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.849 
system here where we don't use that much
water<00:02:19.879> we<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.299> waterless<00:02:21.109> composting

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
water we have a waterless composting

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.539 
water we have a waterless composting
toilet<00:02:22.219> system<00:02:23.889> we<00:02:24.889> have<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.069> shower<00:02:25.310> instead

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
toilet system we have a shower instead

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.640 
toilet system we have a shower instead
of<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> bat<00:02:25.939> it's<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.049> two<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.230> us<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.469> live

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
of a bat it's just the two of us I live

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.729 
of a bat it's just the two of us I live
here<00:02:27.859> so<00:02:28.510> both<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.540> these<00:02:29.840> tanks<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:30.500> there

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
here so both of these tanks here there

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.209 
here so both of these tanks here there
are<00:02:30.799> 1500<00:02:31.280> gallon<00:02:31.519> tanks<00:02:31.909> actually<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:33.620> little

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
are 1500 gallon tanks actually a little

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.129 
are 1500 gallon tanks actually a little
more<00:02:34.370> than<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:34.639> like<00:02:34.819> 1650<00:02:35.599> filled<00:02:35.870> up<00:02:36.019> all

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
more than that like 1650 filled up all

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.410 
more than that like 1650 filled up all
the<00:02:36.230> way<00:02:36.319> to<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.500> top<00:02:37.060> that's<00:02:38.060> plenty<00:02:38.299> of

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the way to the top that's plenty of

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.729 
the way to the top that's plenty of
water<00:02:38.659> for<00:02:38.750> us<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:39.409> want<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.620> make<00:02:39.709> sure

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
water for us so you want to make sure

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.470 
water for us so you want to make sure
the<00:02:40.040> first<00:02:40.219> thing<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.519> line<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.879> isolation

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the first thing in line is isolation

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.780 
the first thing in line is isolation
valve<00:02:41.829> that<00:02:42.829> way<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.219> ever<00:02:43.400> gets<00:02:43.549> knocked

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
valve that way if this ever gets knocked

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.330 
valve that way if this ever gets knocked
loose<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.299> any<00:02:44.389> reason<00:02:44.840> or<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.859> need<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.159> work

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
loose for any reason or you need to work

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.599 
loose for any reason or you need to work
on<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:46.840> your<00:02:47.840> piping<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.439> can<00:02:49.159> just<00:02:49.370> close

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
on it your piping you can just close

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.399 
on it your piping you can just close
this<00:02:49.760> valve<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.480> retain<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.079> your<00:02:51.290> water

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
this valve and you retain all your water

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.809 
this valve and you retain all your water
in<00:02:51.560> your<00:02:51.650> tank<00:02:51.829> we're<00:02:52.189> not<00:02:52.310> gonna<00:02:52.430> waste<00:02:52.609> it

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
in your tank we're not gonna waste it

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.360 
in your tank we're not gonna waste it
now<00:02:53.689> as<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.409> can<00:02:54.469> see<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.859> there's<00:02:55.069> a<00:02:55.159> hose

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
now as you can see here there's a hose

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.599 
now as you can see here there's a hose
bib<00:02:55.609> and<00:02:55.879> that's<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.989> really<00:02:57.949> neat<00:02:58.129> little

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
bib and that's a really neat little

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.259 
bib and that's a really neat little
addition<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.389> reason<00:02:59.629> I<00:02:59.689> put<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.019> there<00:03:00.290> is

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
addition the reason I put that there is

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.559 
addition the reason I put that there is
for<00:03:02.709> using<00:03:03.709> water<00:03:04.069> for<00:03:04.519> utility<00:03:04.909> purposes<00:03:05.120> out

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
for using water for utility purposes out

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.289 
for using water for utility purposes out
in<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.260> backyard<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.819> we<00:03:07.879> don't<00:03:08.090> even

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
in the backyard here and we don't even

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.330 
in the backyard here and we don't even
need<00:03:08.449> a<00:03:08.510> pump<00:03:08.840> we're<00:03:09.439> just<00:03:09.590> using<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.010> static

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
need a pump we're just using the static

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.819 
need a pump we're just using the static
head<00:03:10.569> pressure<00:03:11.569> of<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.019> water<00:03:12.169> the<00:03:12.500> height<00:03:12.650> of

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
head pressure of the water the height of

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.140 
head pressure of the water the height of
the<00:03:12.889> water<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:14.030> pressure<00:03:14.319> there<00:03:15.319> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the water here for pressure there and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.099 
the water here for pressure there and
that's<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.209> neat<00:03:17.359> little<00:03:17.480> addition<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:17.959> would

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
that's a neat little addition I would

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.619 
that's a neat little addition I would
recommend<00:03:18.729> anyway<00:03:19.729> this<00:03:20.030> header<00:03:20.269> goes

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
recommend anyway this header goes

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.800 
recommend anyway this header goes
