00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
which we'll get to in a minute there is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
which we'll get to in a minute there is
actually<00:02:01.649> also<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> PvP<00:02:02.490> resilience<00:02:02.909> enchant

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
actually also a PvP resilience enchant

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
actually also a PvP resilience enchant

which gives an additional 200 PvP
resilience<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> obviously<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.860> great

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
resilience now this is obviously a great

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.949 
resilience now this is obviously a great
way<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.429> additional<00:02:08.729> max<00:02:09.300> level<00:02:09.629> players

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
way to get additional max level players

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.290 
way to get additional max level players
who<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.259> PvE<00:02:10.560> geared<00:02:11.039> into<00:02:11.370> pvp<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.239> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
who are PvE geared into pvp but do you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.730 
who are PvE geared into pvp but do you
remember<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.780> course<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.200> p

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
remember of course that p

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740 
remember of course that p
p<00:02:13.920> power<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.370> still<00:02:14.610> present<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.180> all<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.600> this

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
p power is still present on all of this

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.230 
p power is still present on all of this
gear<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.230> therefore<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.250> pvp<00:02:17.700> gear<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.000> still

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
gear and therefore the pvp gear is still

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.170 
gear and therefore the pvp gear is still
going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.600> superior<00:02:19.080> for<00:02:19.410> pvp<00:02:20.180> another

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
going to be superior for pvp another

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.700 
going to be superior for pvp another
great<00:02:21.390> change<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.810> we've<00:02:21.930> seen<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
great change that we've seen is the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590 
great change that we've seen is the
ability<00:02:23.040> for<00:02:23.280> low-level<00:02:23.940> miners<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
ability for low-level miners and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.330 
ability for low-level miners and
herbalist<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.140> gather<00:02:25.350> herbs<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.890> level<00:02:26.160> all

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
look now this is basically the in-game

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.860 
look now this is basically the in-game
browser<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.760> open<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.180> up<00:03:33.300> by<00:03:33.510> moving<00:03:33.720> your

mouse over to the red ? and clicking on
that<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.390> little<00:03:36.420> bit<00:03:36.750> slow<00:03:37.050> too<00:03:37.110> low<00:03:37.320> but

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
that it's a little bit slow too low but

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.840 
that it's a little bit slow too low but
you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.770> see<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.250> coming<00:03:38.460> up<00:03:38.640> here
