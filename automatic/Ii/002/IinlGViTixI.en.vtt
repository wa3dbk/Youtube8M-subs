00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello together to a new edition 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.210
 from the Czech bakery they run today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.099
 the fryer because of the last may 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.429
 and today do cases ticks in the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.500
 to perceive fryer like sheep's cheese 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.379
 mozzarella or and emmentaler 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 I start now a ca 1 through 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.130
 one and a half centimeters thick slices of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 Construction of the blocks to cut 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:30.720
 the same thing does not matter to him the two 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 slices are now nicely even in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:49.500
 Strip it so we cut it afterwards 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:50.700
 nice next run get that way now 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.710
 it goes to the sheep cheese 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.379
 We also cut these in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 even stripes comes to an end 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.940
 still the mozzarella 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.410
 this is only halved 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.720
 and then also not 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.650
 doubt cut the whole must now 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.080
 be operated on 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.049
 For this we need flour eggs and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.970
 Semmelbrösel we start with it the eggs 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.350
 pepper with salt and pepper 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.350
 then to whisk 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.410
 Now everything is ready for the sticks 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.620
 to lose 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.900
 We never take a turn here 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.930
 mail it then in the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.360
 Turn the plate so that each 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.040
 side is covered with ice and give 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.060
 afterwards in the plate with the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.860
 Semmelbröseln here would now under the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.360
 well covered with breadcrumbs so 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:57.770
 no more cheese out looks the whole 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.050
 here again with a bit 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:07.340
 mozzarella first the flour then the egg and 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.350
 then the semmel dice if the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 The panade does not quite cover the whole thing 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.590
 rather parry again 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.110
 to prevent the cheese from being added 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.790
 Quote here is a few pictures 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.850
 the whole is now in 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.310
 Sleeps 70 to 180 until she is beautiful 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:37.850
 golden brown are usually that takes 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.630
 no more than two minutes and you're done 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.610

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.920
