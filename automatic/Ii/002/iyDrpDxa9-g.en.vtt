capped every day and then once we got
toward<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.530> end<00:02:22.560> like<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.130> way<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.430> worked<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
toward the end like the way it worked is

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.470 
toward the end like the way it worked is
at<00:02:24.030> level<00:02:24.239> 23<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:26.370> cap<00:02:26.640> would<00:02:26.790> go<00:02:26.970> away<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
at level 23 it the cap would go away and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.290 
at level 23 it the cap would go away and
then<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.800> free<00:02:29.280> race<00:02:29.790> just

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
then it was just like a free race just

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.080 
then it was just like a free race just
to<00:02:30.540> level<00:02:31.080> 25<00:02:31.410> which<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.190> whoever<00:02:32.670> got<00:02:32.910> there

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
to level 25 which is whoever got there

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.710
