00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.449
 within the framework of the national rice congress that took place the week 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.469
 pass 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.360
 the colonel bogado the expert in this field of money hector Ramirez 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.769
 translators on proper fertilization 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.150
 which is directly related to the good management of this crop 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.300
 Mr. Hector Ramírez rice cultivation effort 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.470
 expressed that we are entering the stage of fine tuning in the cultivation of 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.720
 this item where all the components must be taken into account for a 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.100
 good response to fertilization 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.580
 expressed that one of the most important factors is the agronomic management of 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.460
 culture 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.270
 because if it is not done properly the crop will not have the answer 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.900
 expected to fertilize and in many cases may even have an effect 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.780
 negative 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.780
 then now they called it emphasis is on the handling 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.040
 that has to do with the fertilization response because it is the way of a 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.030
 input carlos inputs more expensive than the assault of high cost of cultivars the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.990
 fertilization 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.830
 so 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.530
 now begins question of soil preparation 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.600
 the preparation because that is what is going to generate a good knowledge of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.110
 Cultivation says that going to generate good water management is what is going to generate a 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.930
 good weed control 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.510
 and all those actors that was considered part of a fertilization response 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.870
 no final adjustment of all agronomic fatigue should be made 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.620
 so what a fashionable recommendation the hour starting from that base who does not 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.660
 is still preparing his area for problems of this excess water 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.990
 that look for the way to prepare well in managua in mud because there are alternatives 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.910
 to use in dry soil in mud and water the preparation this important prepare 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.510
 as well as announced now part meteorology also a dry period 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.690
 and the less it is removed after this is the ground trainer more 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.090
 time he keeps the look of his then very important is also 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.239
 How sad and just our emphasis 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.299
 the main one in this process of physical preparation of soils for 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.590
 counteract all that are done in action that provides to have the preparation 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.989
 tandil 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.739
 and to her over element by element after which way she responds that being 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.859
 very varied 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.939
 there is no recipe in the subjects in the 8 we currently work with nava 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.310
 assured the teacher 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.479
 services inc 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.389
 generalize 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.579
 the fertilization dose that is being used in our country according to the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.749
 Professional is the following 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.499
 basically you work with a good base where I am I have said no in 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.639
 plantings 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.449
 p around there in about 20 kilometers p of phosphorus 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:02.619
 free and that amount also 50 to 60 kilometers that simple per hectare 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.079
 just that they generalize 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.799
 the needs of the p fields according to natural garcía the soils 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.709
 to set a single goal of productivity is very variable is very 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.529
 variable because we what 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.869
 low performance expectations 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.160
 the expert assured that with an adequate participation 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.660
 and with good management the producer obtains benefits that compensate the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.729
 costs 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.999
 we do not have objections moderately bob balanced soil and for 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.139
 what we have 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.419
 the Nazis inefficiency of some elements and notorious 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.899
 because peace on the ground in that country is an essential element if not 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.819
 we subtract arming contreras 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.469
 And in that we have around six thousand kilos 3000 kilos and 1500 kilos until 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.889
 four thousand kilos 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.180
 above the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.140
 the natural appearance of the soil we have 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.539
 in a base fertilization of 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:04.239
 warrior of 250 kilos of fertilization that we make of grace n 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.379
 neither said that he should not have those two stars 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.290
 compensated to put much cost will not vary or is not more than the deficit 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.769
 issued from 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.019
 virgilio of savings in 1515 joust 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.749
 and just there lies the range to be produced 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.500
 because if this did not cost this civilization it is covered 104 percent 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.409
 the dollar less than one tonne a ton 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.409
 to chile and in the middle of savings 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.900
 there and that is generating a thousand 500 thousand or thousand 508 thousand kilos of wool 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.600
 because that effect 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.730
 expressed that fertilization in good management must be taken into account 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.700
 the precision 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.770
 the right moment and the right way 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.139
 emphasized the importance of preparing the soil in time because otherwise 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.069
 you will not have the performance prospects you have with a 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.009
 Advance preparation especially in places where rice was already grown 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:05.129
 mentioned that the rest of the crop has to be recycled immediately 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.249
 after the harvest so they have a decomposition time 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.870
 the professional gave some more considerations as a way of 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.520
 recommendation to producers 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.800
 you have to be aware of what conditions you are entering to work and 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.819
 what is your actual expectation of production according to all those actors 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.759
 although the performance to the car 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.759
 We have to consider 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.590
 it is very common that people forget about a fault because the ross has its 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.590
 macoya capacity this apparent recovery 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.050
 but nevertheless we can say that he cultivated his crop potential 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.370
 they do the first 30 days no more do you want 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.130
 nor is it even enough for macías has also submitted is already established 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.490
 all the potential 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.400
 in matter of distribution of plant the part of cleaning of the handling part 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.240
 of water that will generate the differentiated response 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.509
 alvarado fertilization of nutritional foods 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.539
 then it is very demanding cultivation the others we are in that phase that we have 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.259
 that to consider executive becomes etxeita at the time one minute 80 first ediles 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:09.849
 of 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.499
 establishment 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:17.159
 and revealed that he comes by estimating that he called him again the perfumery of 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.360
 most beautiful steel 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.550
 that we are fine from this time but the power makes no sense
