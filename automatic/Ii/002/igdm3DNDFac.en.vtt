00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello thank you for joining me in another 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.640
 tutorial I am mireia because that's how I used to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 the father and I think it's always a little 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 harder to find a gift for a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910
 man that for a woman I think for 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 women there are more options but you do not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.240
 worry in this tutorial demonstrates 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.240
 how to make a gift for them 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.699
 we're going to need red felt stuffing 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.590
 black and white scissors thread needle and a 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.720
 tape to measure all these materials 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.059
 you can find them in level fantasies 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.670
 first we will measure and we will mark a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.829
 rectangle of 30 x 40 centimeters in the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.520
 white felt then we'll cut it down let's 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.410
 to need two pieces like this 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.090
 now with white thread and the needle that 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 we will use around these two rectangles 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.960
 to join them 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.600
 when you are missing a bit to finish for 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.220
 of mus we will turn the felt 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 in this way so that the thread you see 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.390
 inside and not notice so much 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.380
 now we will place the filling inside 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.380
 our pillow 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.530
 and now if we do not know what we were missing 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.170
 to end 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 what follows is decorating it for we want 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:53.009
 on the red felt two letters to the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.009
 small hearts and one big one 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.500
 then we will cut them 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.950
 we will make them fit on the pillow 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.950
 what we did to verify that they remain 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.650
 and you can stick them with a little silicon 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.060
 or sew them if you're going to sew them 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.420
 will enrich before joining the two 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.420
 rectangles 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.620
 you can make three more letters to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.620
 complete the four aces and ready 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.700
 share the practice would consist a lot 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 I leave my facebook 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.400
