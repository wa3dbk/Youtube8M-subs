00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.690
 hello friends and welcome to this 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.270
 new video in which we are going 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.440
 see how you remake legs 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.130
 less than five minutes 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.070
 this trick that the pros use is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.770
 often used when attracting 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.099
 a lot of stepping on a long on 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.590
 a long distance and style on the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.850
 flat and then we know we will arrive 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.710
 in a rib in a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.270
 in a climb we must have the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 legs a little bit more flexible in 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.170
 general in the last climb 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.970
 okay while we fired and that we 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.210
 begins to see the legs a little hard 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.640
 fatigue and thighs full of acid 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.410
 lactic concrete legs etc etc 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.390
 well I will give you this little 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.800
 trick that is extremely effective that 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.810
 I invite you to test of course 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.850
 in training after sessions of 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.550
 strong either near the split and well 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.950
 to do that or just after 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.290
 long shot alternate a minute of 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.119
 the hyper velocity and a minute ten 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.159
 pairs force ie that really 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.679
 if you are on the flat you put 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.289
 all right you turn your legs 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.390
 gently at 50.69 feet per minute in 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.700
 really forcing a lot 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.229
 and after a minute, well you 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.819
 turn your legs you put everything to 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.030
 left and you turn your legs 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:31.990
 extremely fast as soon as possible 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.700
 to revive your bike cited beyond 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.439
 120 pedal laps per minute it's very 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.520
 okay so even if you're on 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.009
 the dish even if you are in a 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.929
 slight climb do it before being 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.939
 in a coast very very very hard because 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.590
 that even there on the left it is difficult to 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.780
 put a velocity but makes the hyper 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.889
 velocity at least 1,120 turns pedal 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.439
 and then after a minute you 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:52.749
 come back for a minute in velocity 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.729
 and a minute in force so five minutes 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.249
 okay in five times you do that 5 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.840
 It's a minute and a minute 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.490
 in force a minute in velocity a mi 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.529
 highlights are velocity minutes 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.549
 and a last minute force and you 

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.649
 go see it's magic 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.969
 after you flip your legs and you 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.190
 feel like having legs 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.750
 new as new 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.950
 in any case when we have legs that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.630
 harden a little bit that they have 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.370
 tendency to cramp and as much as 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.290
 tendency to get heavier 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.850
 well we find good legs of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.230
 good feelings so I'm not saying that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.519
 if you want 200 info terminals 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.250
 and you have to go up another 3 call 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.080

 see that it's really a trick 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.860
 very interesting to do when one is 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.080
 in a group we got a little shot 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 behind we do a little bit that just 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.720
 before once the last climb 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.330
 and you are going to have very good 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.260
