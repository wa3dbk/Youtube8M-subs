 illustrious titles such as pokémon as before 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.870
 after reaching the repo dix ellis 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 you need to search for gps phone and download 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.270
 gps with a gps funds that are one to the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.750
 program is something that does it 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750
 work 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.090
 once this is done, it must always be subsidized 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.640
 add another network that is to 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.840

 wifi network that will give us an address 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.010
 the last address for example to me from 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.209
 192 16 81 67 10 thousand this address 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.480

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.560
