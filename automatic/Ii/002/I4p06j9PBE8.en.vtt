00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.940
 very good everyone I am the doc and in this 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.650
 video let's see a seed a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 pretty interesting seed is going to be a 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.559
 pretty short video but good what 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.559
 know here 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:22.340
 and here in the seed we have to put 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.730
 I am and the walkman let's go let's add 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.310
 the world 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 and the truth is that this is starting very 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.860
 really good 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.610
 but well let's see load this before 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.470
 you had a book you get to choose 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 well now I do not understand 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.250
 before I had gone out there where the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.970
 pokemon a bunch of weird pokemon that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 I do not have but what we're going 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.370
 but he is receiving from hosts very well 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.440
 the seed does not come directly here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.670
 little town like that so as not to have to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.519
 worry about hunger and so on 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.519
 and now if we come around here it's 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.640
 here I think so 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.409
 let's look at this what we 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.620
 we found a diamond two swords of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.360
 oxidiana iron 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 the truth that is very well I do not know why 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.870
 Why I am not loaded me the skin of man 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.870
 which is at 15 the zombie dj 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 good 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.970
 I 've been doing tests and it has 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.660
 I have always left, I hope that you 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.570
 come out so well 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.640
 anyway if you do not come out tell me and 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.090
 to put the video that does not always come out 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.000
 or something 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 From here , two games of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 where he is taken from the internet he said 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.770
 three diamonds came out and only man left 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.479
 one but good is always going to come out of that 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.270
 a diamond two swords of iron the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.060
 obsidian them 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.590
 but good to see what you think is deserted 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.570
 interesting to start the game well 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.079
 directly because here you do not have 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.119
 to worry about food or anything and 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.950
 let's hope you liked that you do not vote 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.950
 like favorites and even another 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.350
