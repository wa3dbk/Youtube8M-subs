00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
tablets so we're gonna screw these into

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.069 
tablets so we're gonna screw these into
place<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:31.980> we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.610> screw<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
place and then we're going to screw this

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.440 
place and then we're going to screw this
onto<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> mount<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.800> actually<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
onto the mount this is actually a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
onto the mount this is actually a
handlebar<00:00:37.230> mount<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.280> hoping<00:00:38.489> it's

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
handlebar mount but I'm hoping it's

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
handlebar mount but I'm hoping it's
gonna<00:00:38.790> fit<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> holy<00:00:39.930> handle<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
gonna fit on the holy handle in the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
gonna fit on the holy handle in the
Jeep<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> passenger<00:00:41.399> side<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.030> good<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Jeep on the passenger side it's good in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.569 
Jeep on the passenger side it's good in
so<00:00:42.719> let's<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> other<00:00:43.469> side<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> said

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so let's do the other side like I said

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
so let's do the other side like I said
there's<00:00:44.789> other<00:00:45.200> attachments<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.350> for

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there's other attachments here for

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
there's other attachments here for
whatever<00:00:46.860> type<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> tablet<00:00:47.460> our<00:00:47.910> accessory

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
whatever type of tablet our accessory

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
whatever type of tablet our accessory
you<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> connect<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.440> hopefully<00:00:49.680> one

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you want to connect to it hopefully one

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.500 
you want to connect to it hopefully one
of<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.250> work<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.969> attached<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of those will work for you attached to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
of those will work for you attached to
the<00:00:51.989> movable<00:00:52.500> mount<00:00:52.739> let's<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.160> outside<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the movable mount let's go outside of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.360 
the movable mount let's go outside of
the<00:00:53.699> Jeep<00:00:54.050> see<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> will<00:00:55.620> work<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the Jeep see if this will work if not I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
the Jeep see if this will work if not I
guess<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.850> won't<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:58.079> let's<00:00:58.440> hope<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
guess you won't see it but let's hope it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.880 
guess you won't see it but let's hope it
does<00:00:59.039> go<00:00:59.789> get<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> done<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.930> lot<00:01:01.410> nicer<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
does go get that done a lot nicer I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.789 
does go get that done a lot nicer I
thought<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.430> connected<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.140> u-bolt

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
thought I connected it with a u-bolt

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.140 
thought I connected it with a u-bolt
that<00:01:05.040> came<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> kid<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> comes<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.090> a

shorter<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.140> used<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.439> longer<00:01:07.680> one

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
shorter one too but I used a longer one

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
shorter one too but I used a longer one
