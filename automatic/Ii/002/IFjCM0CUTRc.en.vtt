00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
as opposed to a French braid which would

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.400 
as opposed to a French braid which would
be<00:00:59.370> three<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> fishtail<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.109> pretty

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
be three with the fishtail it's pretty

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139 
be three with the fishtail it's pretty
simple<00:01:01.800> you're<00:01:02.010> actually<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.550> taking<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
simple you're actually just taking a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.359 
simple you're actually just taking a
piece<00:01:03.480> from<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.470> moving<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.250> over

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
piece from the right and moving it over

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
piece from the right and moving it over
to<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> left<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> feeding<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.560> left

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to the left and feeding it from the left

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.469 
to the left and feeding it from the left
and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.189> crossing<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> right<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and then crossing over to the right and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
and then crossing over to the right and
the<00:01:09.630> smaller<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> strands<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the smaller that the strands are is the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
the smaller that the strands are is the
better<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.390> again<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.110> doesn't<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> be

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
better and again it doesn't have to be

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.310 
better and again it doesn't have to be
super<00:01:14.310> perfect<00:01:14.729> because<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:16.080> pull

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
super perfect because we are gonna pull

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
super perfect because we are gonna pull
everything<00:01:16.619> apart<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.580> when<00:01:17.759> we're<00:01:17.909> done

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
everything apart and when we're done

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.370 
everything apart and when we're done
it's<00:01:18.240> actually<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.140> look

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's actually not even gonna really look

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's actually not even gonna really look
like<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> braid<00:01:19.950> okay<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.360> getting

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450

towards the end but with this braid you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
towards the end but with this braid you
don't<00:01:24.119> want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.780> way<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> very

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
don't want to go all the way to the very

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
don't want to go all the way to the very
end<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:27.000> gonna<00:01:27.090> pull<00:01:27.390> this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

apart so for right now I'm going to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.649 
apart so for right now I'm going to
leave<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> braid<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.329> gonna<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
leave the braid and we're gonna go to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
leave the braid and we're gonna go to
the<00:01:30.869> next<00:01:31.110> section<00:01:31.380> same<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.250> before<00:01:32.280> we're

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the next section same like before we're

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
the next section same like before we're
doing<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> fishtail<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.930> we're<00:01:34.049> just

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
doing the fishtail and we're just

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.450 
doing the fishtail and we're just
starting<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:34.770> strands<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.340> not

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
starting with two strands I'm not

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
starting with two strands I'm not
braiding<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> into<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> scalp<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:37.020> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
braiding it into the scalp I'm just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
braiding it into the scalp I'm just
starting<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> root<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.880> moving

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
starting from the root and I'm moving

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
starting from the root and I'm moving
down<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.740> keeping<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> decent<00:01:41.189> amount<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
down I'm keeping a decent amount of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
down I'm keeping a decent amount of
tension<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.659> keep<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> braid<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.560> place

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
tension and to keep the braid in place

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.219 
tension and to keep the braid in place
I've<00:01:43.979> placed<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.460> thumb<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> base<00:01:45.689> I'm

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
I've placed my thumb at the base I'm

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.600 
I've placed my thumb at the base I'm
just<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> moving<00:01:46.860> around<00:01:47.070> her<00:01:47.399> head

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just kind of moving around her head

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
just kind of moving around her head
following<00:01:48.030> her<00:01:48.240> head<00:01:48.450> shape<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> back<00:01:49.500> I'm

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
following her head shape in the back I'm

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
following her head shape in the back I'm
gonna<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.850> take<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.420> sections<00:01:51.990> I'm

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
gonna just take two more sections I'm

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
gonna just take two more sections I'm
going<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> diagonal<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.490> using<00:01:53.939> my

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
going out of diagonal just using my

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.819 
going out of diagonal just using my
finger<00:01:54.360> again<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> want<00:01:55.110> everything<00:01:55.380> dairy

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
finger again I want everything dairy

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.569 
finger again I want everything dairy

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so this is my last section here this is

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.440 
so this is my last section here this is
my<00:02:07.590> final<00:02:07.799> section<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> left

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
my final section which is on the left

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.029 
my final section which is on the left
side<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.989> we're<00:02:10.140> gonna<00:02:10.229> braid<00:02:10.530> everything

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
side and we're gonna braid everything

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.119 
side and we're gonna braid everything
going<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> around<00:02:12.120> her<00:02:12.330> ear<00:02:13.129> we

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
going back and around her ear we

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.070 
going back and around her ear we
finished<00:02:14.489> all<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> our<00:02:14.849> fishtail<00:02:15.209> braids<00:02:15.510> at

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
finished all of our fishtail braids at

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.960 
finished all of our fishtail braids at
five<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.160> I'm<00:02:17.280> gonna<00:02:17.370> take<00:02:17.610> them<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
five of them and I'm gonna take them and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.880 
five of them and I'm gonna take them and
I'm<00:02:18.030> gonna<00:02:18.150> pull<00:02:18.390> them<00:02:18.540> apart<00:02:18.629> cuz<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.709> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
I'm gonna pull them apart cuz this is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.910 
I'm gonna pull them apart cuz this is
what<00:02:20.099> gives<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.420> cool<00:02:21.750> texture<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
what gives it the really cool texture to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.339 
what gives it the really cool texture to
create<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.370> updo<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.810> starting<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.319> the

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
create the updo and I'm starting at the

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.500 
create the updo and I'm starting at the
root<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.920> I'm<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.580> really<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.030> pulling<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
root and I'm just really just pulling it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.020 
root and I'm just really just pulling it
all<00:02:27.690> apart<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.769> can<00:02:28.920> see<00:02:29.160> how<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.489> has<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
all apart and you can see how it has the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.110 
all apart and you can see how it has the
fuzzy<00:02:30.390> pieces<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.280> inconsistencies<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.819> I'm

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
fuzzy pieces and inconsistencies and I'm

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.150 
fuzzy pieces and inconsistencies and I'm
pulling<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.840> center<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.920> don't

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
pulling it from the center so I don't

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.890 
pulling it from the center so I don't
destroy<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.700> shape<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.299> keep<00:02:36.540> still<00:02:36.810> of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
destroy the shape and I keep still of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.380 
destroy the shape and I keep still of
that<00:02:36.930> fishtail<00:02:37.590> effect<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> you're<00:02:39.269> really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
that fishtail effect so you're really

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.449 
that fishtail effect so you're really
adding<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.840> lot<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.049> volume<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.769> knocks<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
adding a lot of volume and knocks to the

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.119 
adding a lot of volume and knocks to the
braid<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.000> have<00:02:42.989> everything<00:02:43.260> pulled<00:02:43.590> apart<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
braid I have everything pulled apart and

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.680 
braid I have everything pulled apart and
I<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.579> texture<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.599> all

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
I like the texture I like how it's all

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
I like the texture I like how it's all
falling<00:02:46.140> apart<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.099> really<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> fun

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
falling apart and this is really the fun

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.009 
falling apart and this is really the fun
part<00:02:47.940> because<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.569> part<00:02:48.780> where<00:02:48.900> I'm

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
part because this is the part where I'm

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.309 
part because this is the part where I'm
creating<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.799> shape<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.599> using<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.989> French

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
creating the shape so I'm using a French

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.860 
creating the shape so I'm using a French
hair<00:02:52.829> pan<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.190> opposed<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.700> bobby<00:02:53.970> pin<00:02:54.090> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
hair pan as opposed to a bobby pin and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.539 
hair pan as opposed to a bobby pin and
when<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.079> put<00:02:55.260> these<00:02:55.379> in<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.160> little<00:02:56.430> bit

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
when you put these in it's a little bit

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.110 
when you put these in it's a little bit
of<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.730> trick<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.780> go<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.730> then<00:02:59.730> go

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of a trick you have to go up and then go

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:10.760 
of a trick you have to go up and then go
back<00:03:00.780> down

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.010 

so<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.820> finished<00:03:12.240> look<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
so this is the finished look I think it

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.050 
so this is the finished look I think it
turned<00:03:13.350> out<00:03:13.440> really<00:03:13.620> beautiful<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.490> feel<00:03:14.940> like

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
turned out really beautiful I feel like

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.270 
turned out really beautiful I feel like
it's<00:03:15.210> a<00:03:15.300> really<00:03:15.510> modern<00:03:15.720> take<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.410> braid<00:03:16.920> I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it's a really modern take on braid I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.950 
it's a really modern take on braid I
kept<00:03:17.550> everything<00:03:17.790> kind<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.600> tighter

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
kept everything kind of a little tighter

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.200 
kept everything kind of a little tighter
on<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.290> side<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.950> little<00:03:20.550> volume<00:03:20.730> through<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210
