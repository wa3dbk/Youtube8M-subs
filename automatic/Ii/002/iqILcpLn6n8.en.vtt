00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
hello this is my lego safe now this is

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.870 
hello this is my lego safe now this is
my<00:00:08.040> second<00:00:08.580> model<00:00:09.150> right<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.800> built<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
my second model right first I built a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.300 
my second model right first I built a
while<00:00:12.269> ago<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.410> they<00:00:14.370> kept<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.880> breaking<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
while ago and they kept on breaking the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.640 
while ago and they kept on breaking the
unlocking<00:00:17.310> mechanism<00:00:17.550> inside<00:00:18.230> but<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> finally

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
unlocking mechanism inside but I finally

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.220 
unlocking mechanism inside but I finally
fixed<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:21.080> now<00:00:22.550> isn't<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.699> soon<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.199> a

a rubber band pulling the locking

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.070 
a rubber band pulling the locking
mechanism<00:01:34.950> back<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.330> automatically

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
mechanism back in so it automatically

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.630 
mechanism back in so it automatically
locks<00:01:37.440> if<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.979> heard<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.399> click<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> clap
