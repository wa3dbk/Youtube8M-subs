by card effects once per turn that's the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
by card effects once per turn that's the
fact<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.420> equip<00:01:06.659> spell<00:01:06.689> card<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.200> don't

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
fact of the equip spell card I don't

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.570 
fact of the equip spell card I don't
think<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.590> viable<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.369> let's<00:01:08.490> go

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
think it's that viable but let's go

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
think it's that viable but let's go
ahead<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.820> jump<00:01:08.939> straight<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> otk<00:01:09.840> did

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
ahead and jump straight into the otk did

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
ahead and jump straight into the otk did
you<00:01:10.290> explain<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.700> they

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you explain it in here as well but they

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.830 
you explain it in here as well but they
kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> leave<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> stuff<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
kind of leave a lot of stuff which is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
kind of leave a lot of stuff which is
can<00:01:13.530> lead<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.189> some<00:01:14.340> confusion<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.939> anyways

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
can lead to some confusion but anyways

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
can lead to some confusion but anyways
as<00:01:15.960> far<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.650> discussing<00:01:17.040> the

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
deck is you know looking a little bit

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.770 
deck is you know looking a little bit
better<00:04:43.830> at<00:04:44.040> least<00:04:44.160> has<00:04:44.370> some<00:04:44.400> ot<00:04:44.820> KS<00:04:45.030> but<00:04:45.510> risky

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
better at least has some ot KS but risky

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.810

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.050 
cards as far as them being competitive I
think<00:05:29.010> some<00:05:29.220> people<00:05:29.370> will<00:05:29.580> try<00:05:29.760> them<00:05:29.940> out

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
think some people will try them out

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.700 
think some people will try them out
although<00:05:30.330> I'm<00:05:30.780> kind<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.020> sad<00:05:31.260> that<00:05:31.289> this<00:05:31.500> card

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
although I'm kind of sad that this card

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.380 
although I'm kind of sad that this card
is<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:31.830> secret<00:05:32.130> rare<00:05:32.250> because<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.669> would<00:05:33.090> hope<00:05:33.240> it

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
is a secret rare because I would hope it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.150 
is a secret rare because I would hope it
would<00:05:33.419> be<00:05:33.690> like<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.229> bunch<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:34.770> deck<00:05:34.919> because

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
would be like a bunch of deck because

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.469 
would be like a bunch of deck because
they<00:05:35.280> kept<00:05:35.460> on<00:05:35.520> releasing<00:05:35.940> these<00:05:36.030> cards<00:05:36.360> in

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
they kept on releasing these cards in

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.920 
they kept on releasing these cards in
the<00:05:37.190> sneak<00:05:38.190> peak<00:05:38.430> but<00:05:39.150> we<00:05:39.330> never<00:05:39.510> really<00:05:39.600> got

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
the sneak peak but we never really got

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.540 
the sneak peak but we never really got
to<00:05:40.140> like<00:05:40.410> see<00:05:40.650> them<00:05:40.800> see<00:05:40.950> any<00:05:41.100> play<00:05:41.250> because

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
to like see them see any play because

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.430 
to like see them see any play because
they<00:05:41.729> weren't<00:05:41.880> like<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.510> strong<00:05:42.870> but<00:05:43.289> now

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
they weren't like that strong but now

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.800 
they weren't like that strong but now
with<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:44.280> wall<00:05:44.490> chavin<00:05:44.910> perhaps<00:05:45.330> it'll<00:05:45.660> be<00:05:45.780> a

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
with the wall chavin perhaps it'll be a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.540 
with the wall chavin perhaps it'll be a
more<00:05:46.140> viable<00:05:46.440> deck<00:05:46.740> but<00:05:47.130> let<00:05:47.250> me<00:05:47.310> know<00:05:47.400> what

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
more viable deck but let me know what

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.460 
more viable deck but let me know what
you<00:05:47.640> guys<00:05:47.760> thoughts<00:05:48.090> are<00:05:48.240> on<00:05:48.270> this<00:05:48.600> deck<00:05:49.140> but

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
you guys thoughts are on this deck but

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.380 
you guys thoughts are on this deck but
personally<00:05:49.919> for<00:05:50.070> me<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.370> think<00:05:50.910> it's<00:05:51.090> an<00:05:51.150> OK

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
personally for me I think it's an OK

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
personally for me I think it's an OK
deck<00:05:51.600> but<00:05:51.750> it<00:05:51.840> doesn't<00:05:52.080> have<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.200> chance

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
deck but it doesn't have a chance

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.409 
deck but it doesn't have a chance
against<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.889> tier<00:05:53.070> 1<00:05:53.100> decks<00:05:53.460> so<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:54.240> know<00:05:54.330> if
