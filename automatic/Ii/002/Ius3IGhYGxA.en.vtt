00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.779
 Good evening it's just before ten 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.240
 I have a bit longer about it 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.420
 thought 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.580
 to take advantage of his wisdom 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 to make your own team and take it 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 I also that the opas semi pro goes completely 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550
 Just because I want five people 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.170
 search together and until all 1 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 team what at least platinum has or 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.920
 The platinum is primarily worth a lot 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 that could almost be with yours 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.820
 compare because I know many of yours 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
 tips that are not about gold men 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.520
 Come and I want to fuck these people 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.040
 I want to show you that edo in the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 Soli choir did not mean anything 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 and that ye I now so small 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.710
 own program make almost like salt 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.270
 the patient stands pro i will too 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.719
 really a lot of work reinstecken 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.710
 it is seen that now what with 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.760
 me then most 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.590
 will deal with 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.980
 and the beginning is that it would have only 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.920
 times people find but so let's start 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.020
 the conditions do not care about your egos mika 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 That should know it will be more 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.510
 mainly because such a player arrive 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 as does his basic skills much 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 potential to stay that way so it has 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.689
 be at least 16 years old 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 or just within the next three 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.299
 months 16 will be me completely 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.890
 important i still have contact to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.869
 smaller sponsors to more 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 sponsors still to clear to the teams 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.680
 they feel a bit too 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 can offer 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.619
 and there is such an old one already 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.899
 the prerequisite there are people who 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.649
 say that from 18 to which we shit the 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.789
 16 is already enough for me and completely 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.610
 I did not make an exception 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.970
 So even if it means now yes me 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.679
 I'll be 16 after three months and one day 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.850
 that is to me no matter i have none 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.689
 Bock meter once again through everything 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.840
 the meadows and a week then I will 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.420
 16 no so what's this whole topic 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.649
 I'll be tough 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.170
 that should have a mailing you 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.509
 So I can use a suction game 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.840
 Now I say no top and play along 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.009
 no the world steers you for one 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.470
 who should be able to apply the time 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.670
 Of course bring along and the motivation 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.319
 a lot of time and work in the team too 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.599
 I think that's it 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.989
 Of course 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.220
 because i will spend just as much time and 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.319
 bring in motivation I want too 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.580
 that even expect from you 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.720
 I think so, that's me then 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.610
 to participate in something more difficult 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.370
 To heap rag to his really cool 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.140
 should make cloths 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.549
 I bring with me the ability to criticize 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.970
 could assume that I have you 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.799
 every single mistake he made on your head 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.630
 will meet and you too 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.220
 appeal because as I said I take that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.600
 seriously and the same I expect from 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.459
 It's not like you guys now 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.370
 He will only claim if it repeatedly 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.200
 then it is already uncool 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.269
 this is the most important year of the year 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.560
 last two points here so the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.970
 conditions no longer apply 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.200
 may be that I forget from when 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.940
 yes it's my fault you can 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.609
 overlook something about it 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.769
 how should calls be able to follow without 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.790
 but even if they are the stupidest 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.670
 calls of the world are 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.810
 I have put in new teams so 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.819
 I was looking for him and he 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.239
 I have so often experienced it was one 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.739
 call made by the call maker and 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.569
 either one has a problem with that 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.910
 not gone in and the colin 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.010
 was even a pretty good one and it is 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.579
 Everything went down because this one 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.220
 The thing was hesitant when a call was made 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.319
 if the korbacher makes it then allowed 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.720
 nobody thinks about it right 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.790
 or wrong either it was one 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.290
 bad call and you lose as 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.140
 team 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.329
 or it was a good call and that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.549
 verkackt as a team 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.829
 yes it does not mean you do not have that 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.540
 not made but is called mountain 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.290
 buyer wrong but we have him wrong 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.060
 As a team, that's what it's all about 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.299
 of course in many teams at one to 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.950
 two caller only I do not care if that 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.750
 I have a topic or two I want 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.370
 people have follow the colts that is 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.569
 I do not want to be important to me 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.040
 that means people who do it now 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.139
 Dragon and the coffee shop even further 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.430
 bot and after that he asks is the dragon 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.389
 gone because there was still no damage 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.739
 the opponents have come and have 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:19.000
 it killed three people has rence 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.289
 for example the gentleman the minimum limit 16 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.750
 is and I think that already 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.750
 most of the audience here also in 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.820
 the age is sure you know that 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.310
 your parents are not going to dump us 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.509
 I had that often enough but for it 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.509
 paid that parents come again 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.560
 to pull the plug 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.720
 I do not know how the training times 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.419
 it could be that we at 7 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.120
 start at 10 o'clock and stop as 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.979
 example now I have a real buck 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.780
 that on as a discreet one at a time 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.250
 few parents so that works for me 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.080
 not clear like that and again 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.310
 as soon as formal editions I go 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.960
 can already imagine 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.789
 depending on the stop how fast then 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.289
 or how do I even apply 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.880
 Extra caps lock written so in the 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.320
 I do not know I will 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.599
 The whole idiot does not do that now 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.720
 I really do not care 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.039
 I will not go to her 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.750
 First write me a message 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.979
 but hold youtube account yes I think 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.470
 you should not do that yet 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.460
 overwhelm what you write yes the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.940
 be with rap 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.349
 jft wipro and then which position 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.860
 you can check out for a single 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.539
 position promote support &amp; carry is 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.349
 or thing i do not want individual 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.360
 race to have flaps 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.370
 I will only be a well-rehearsed one there 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.139
 take team and only one of you 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.139
 Otherwise, I should remember to advertise 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.810
 that is the supporter 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.250
 tries to get both of them out right away 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.669
 So as I said I am with the things 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.680
 pretty strict and you can do that too here 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.190
 watch as a call not to follow 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.320
 I can do it 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.280
 for the postage or legally for both 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.450
 and not both will work for both 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.010
 then I should be a sweet right 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.520
 write text why you think that me 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.690
 should take you I do not know what 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.850
 Write and that is now on the internet 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.230
 let over like carnival arouse 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.140
 could give with two lines that is 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.940
 I do not care so and who tries 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.230
 I suck up I made my 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.810
 not by I want the directly 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.280
 Message I do not want to be so I think 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.400
 I'm the right one because I always do 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.730
 watch your videos or a healthy one 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:24.130
 I do not mind a bullshit 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:27.130
 so I have everything makes me think 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.130
 think 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:35.290
 but at the moment 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.290
 but it goes with it 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.360
 but I suppose one more time directly 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.070
 with the champions playing here so say 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.610
 I times your top three champions for 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.500
 the position except for that too 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.470
 still we take the top 3 mps for the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.660
 lane and everything for me again 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.440
 the experience would be interesting 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.300
 you have that can be great there you can 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.500
 you say hey was private in these two 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.800
 on gold the example 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.820
 and 72 , I was silver as an example so 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.020
 I will not follow you after that 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.320
 take point of criticism of the eu 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.520
 only it is interesting and first 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.230
 if you have special private experiences 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.480
 that's the most important thing for me 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.200
 this is for me as a mirage 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.950
 confessed that the most important thing was that 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.560
 It also goes so far from me I will only 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:30.220
 five people position the chance to give 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.220
 to prove himself 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.990
 if it can be natural that, of course 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.940
 also not totally out of the five people 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.030
 rags are looking for it I want to go back 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.830
 to the joy out who stops 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.290
 either have the water so far from 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.360
 I should somehow be awesome 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.040
 I forgot my important okay 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.600
 I give you your own in the end 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.100
 blame only or should I something is 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.770
 have explained and so on 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.760
