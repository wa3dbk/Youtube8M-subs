about it briefly the other day and even
he<00:04:11.540> wasn't<00:04:11.900> quite<00:04:12.049> sure<00:04:12.079> nor<00:04:12.919> am<00:04:12.950> i<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:14.060> we<00:04:14.510> will

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
he wasn't quite sure nor am i so we will

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.509 
he wasn't quite sure nor am i so we will
see<00:04:15.049> i<00:04:15.260> mean<00:04:15.500> they<00:04:15.620> might<00:04:15.829> have<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.099> take<00:04:16.370> each

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
see i mean they might have to take each

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.050 
see i mean they might have to take each
other<00:04:16.729> on<00:04:16.820> which<00:04:17.799> okay<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:19.340> would<00:04:19.489> be<00:04:19.609> nicer<00:04:19.849> to

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
other on which okay it would be nicer to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.180 
other on which okay it would be nicer to
avoid<00:04:20.930> each<00:04:21.109> other<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.560> give<00:04:21.709> yourself<00:04:21.829> a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
avoid each other and give yourself a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.939 
avoid each other and give yourself a
double<00:04:22.520> chance<00:04:22.750> but<00:04:23.750> winning<00:04:24.620> one<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.860> them

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
double chance but winning one of them

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.770 
double chance but winning one of them
will<00:04:25.099> be<00:04:25.190> hard<00:04:25.400> enough<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.910> maybe<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.570> better

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
will be hard enough so maybe a better

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.360 
will be hard enough so maybe a better

one but um I don't know I think that you

one but um I don't know I think that you
say<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.830> novice<00:04:49.130> earnest<00:04:49.580> could<00:04:49.789> be<00:04:49.940> good<00:04:50.150> I

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419
