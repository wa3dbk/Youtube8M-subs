felt<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.280> Samsung<00:01:53.280> Infuse<00:01:53.460> which<00:01:54.090> I've

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
felt like the Samsung Infuse which I've

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
felt like the Samsung Infuse which I've
used<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.630> lot<00:01:54.750> its<00:01:55.079> almost<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.619> same<00:01:55.740> size<00:01:55.799> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
used a lot its almost the same size is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.440 
used a lot its almost the same size is
actually<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> tiny<00:01:57.180> tiny<00:01:57.509> bit<00:01:57.659> taller<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:59.450> if

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
actually a tiny tiny bit taller and if

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually a tiny tiny bit taller and if
you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.290> wee<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:02.610> wider<00:02:03.229> barely

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
you can see just a wee bit wider barely

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.260 
you can see just a wee bit wider barely
see<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> button<00:02:04.649> sticking<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
see the button sticking out there the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
see the button sticking out there the
other<00:02:06.390> thing<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.659> were<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> compare<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
other thing I were to compare to is the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.690 
other thing I were to compare to is the
droid<00:02:08.250> x<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.819> x-2<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> very<00:02:11.160> much<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.550> same

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
droid x and x-2 so very much the same

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.770 
droid x and x-2 so very much the same
sort<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> form<00:02:12.330> factor

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
sort of form factor

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.600 
sort of form factor
very<00:02:13.410> thin<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.040> you've<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> little

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
very thin and then you've got a little

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.220 
very thin and then you've got a little
hump<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.240> camera<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:16.110> like

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
hump up here with a camera just like

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
hump up here with a camera just like
Detroit<00:02:16.650> X<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:16.950> look<00:02:17.100> at<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> difference<00:02:17.550> in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
Detroit X but look at the difference in

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.410 
Detroit X but look at the difference in
thickness<00:02:18.620> droid<00:02:19.620> x<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:19.980> huge<00:02:20.520> remember

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
thickness droid x is just huge remember

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
thickness droid x is just huge remember
this<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.230> 4g<00:02:22.650> tu<00:02:22.800> pais<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.459> an<00:02:23.550> LTE

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
this is a 4g tu pais this is an LTE

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.090 
this is a 4g tu pais this is an LTE
device<00:02:24.180> first<00:02:24.930> time<00:02:25.110> we've<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.620> seen<00:02:25.830> one

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
device first time we've really seen one

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.570 
device first time we've really seen one
this<00:02:26.250> thin<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:28.100> we'll<00:02:29.100> take<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> look<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.520> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this thin so we'll take a look at the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.640 
this thin so we'll take a look at the
software<00:02:29.730> here<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> minute<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> right

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
software here in a minute on the right

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.920 
software here in a minute on the right
hand<00:02:31.680> side<00:02:32.010> you've<00:02:32.459> got<00:02:32.489> power<00:02:33.180> button<00:02:33.510> nice

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
hand side you've got power button nice

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.390 
hand side you've got power button nice
little<00:02:34.140> texture<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.739> power<00:02:34.920> button<00:02:35.130> too

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
little texture on the power button too

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.340 
little texture on the power button too
so<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:36.270> tense<00:02:36.540> from<00:02:36.690> detail<00:02:36.989> they've<00:02:37.230> done

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
so little tense from detail they've done

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.790 
so little tense from detail they've done
nicely<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.860> tiny<00:02:38.640> little<00:02:39.390> volume<00:02:39.690> rocker<00:02:40.050> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
nicely on tiny little volume rocker so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.890 
nicely on tiny little volume rocker so
not<00:02:41.160> totally<00:02:41.940> different<00:02:42.330> than<00:02:42.450> what<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.720> have

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
not totally different than what you have

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.259 
not totally different than what you have
on<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> x<00:02:43.319> line<00:02:43.560> actually<00:02:43.830> those<00:02:44.730> black<00:02:45.060> now

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
on the x line actually those black now

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.030 
on the x line actually those black now
instead<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.630> silver<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.230> very<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.590> small

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
instead of silver but very very small

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.190 
instead of silver but very very small
I'd<00:02:48.030> probably<00:02:48.300> prefer<00:02:48.510> something<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.959> little

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
I'd probably prefer something a little

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.860 
I'd probably prefer something a little
bit<00:02:49.380> bigger<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:50.610> easier<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> hit<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.660> one

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
bit bigger just easier to hit that's one

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.810 
bit bigger just easier to hit that's one
piece<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.440> dont<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.890> space<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
piece so you dont have space in the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.130 
piece so you dont have space in the
middle<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.060> help<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.420> remember<00:02:54.690> what's<00:02:54.989> up

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
middle to help you remember what's up

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.770 
middle to help you remember what's up
and<00:02:55.290> what's<00:02:55.440> down<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.910> tactile<00:02:57.480> thing

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
and what's down so just a tactile thing

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.600 
and what's down so just a tactile thing
that's<00:02:57.989> easier<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.410> fingers<00:02:58.739> up<00:02:59.370> top

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
that's easier on the fingers up top

really the non removable battery is
going<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.519> be<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.760> big<00:04:08.910> sticking<00:04:09.209> point<00:04:09.329> for

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
going to be the big sticking point for

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.810 
going to be the big sticking point for
us<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.959> think<00:04:09.989> because<00:04:10.859> you've<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.430> an<00:04:11.519> LTE

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
us I think because you've got an LTE

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.539 
us I think because you've got an LTE
device<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.329> as<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.510> all<00:04:12.540> know<00:04:12.829> LT<00:04:13.829> loves<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
device and as we all know LT loves to

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.569 
device and as we all know LT loves to
suck<00:04:14.760> battery<00:04:15.630> it'll<00:04:16.079> just<00:04:16.109> kill<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.340> we'll

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
suck battery it'll just kill it so we'll

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.190 
suck battery it'll just kill it so we'll
see<00:04:17.700> how<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:17.880> goes<00:04:18.000> as<00:04:18.419> we<00:04:18.570> keep<00:04:18.720> using<00:04:18.959> it

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
see how that goes as we keep using it

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.649 
see how that goes as we keep using it
but<00:04:19.680> there<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:19.979> go<00:04:20.010> for<00:04:20.220> now<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.579> very<00:04:21.269> quick

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
but there you go for now a very quick

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.390 
but there you go for now a very quick
look<00:04:21.900> at<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.169> hardware<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.890> motorola

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400
