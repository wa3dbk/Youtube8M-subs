a<00:02:33.340> bit<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:35.040> open<00:02:36.040> area<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.549> can<00:02:36.700> kind<00:02:36.909> of

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
a bit of a open area you can kind of

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.569 
a bit of a open area you can kind of
slide<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.569> back<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:38.110> forward<00:02:38.579> play

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579

looks really cool again I think the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.930 
looks really cool again I think the
detail<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.560> coloring<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:48.670> nicely

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
think it looks great and of course you

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.339 
think it looks great and of course you
can<00:02:59.560> mix<00:02:59.859> and<00:03:00.010> match<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.450> could<00:03:01.810> put<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
can mix and match so you could put the

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.830 
can mix and match so you could put the
Hulk's<00:03:03.129> feet<00:03:03.450> with<00:03:04.450> Wolverines<00:03:05.340> torso<00:03:06.840> and

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.789 
well I think these are a lot of fun it's
hard<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.910> decide<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.449> this<00:03:52.569> set<00:03:52.900> whether<00:03:53.590> the

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
hard to decide in this set whether the

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.979 
hard to decide in this set whether the
Hulk<00:03:54.010> or<00:03:54.190> Wolverine<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.970> more<00:03:55.180> my<00:03:55.359> favorite<00:03:55.870> I
