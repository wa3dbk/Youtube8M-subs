00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 to take hi knowledge of good again 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.230
 and nicole and that is today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.139
 goulash stew quoted 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.360
 that means then cares and what needs 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 we need a meager piece for that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 meat I have here now in 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 pork but I can do it too 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.939
 well presented with beef or 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.130
 maybe even with a turkey roast 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.769
 has a substantial part and is out of the question 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 brand then we need a vegetable 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.640
 onions of paprika and plain sauerkraut 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.840
 and then an impressive as 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 the potato come be the same 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.239
 spiced , we did not meet salt davis 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 make beef pork and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.510
 this is not such a green sauce 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 We use our spice caste 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 you can see that you deserve it 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 end of the video so we use those 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.840
 a lot of format free super thing looks 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.190
 In any case, we need one 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.790
 small twitch vegetable oil to saute 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.119
 to put pepper marjoram and something 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.580
 paprika powder is still a bit 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 water to liquid for their 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.930
 support and as Thomas marx yes we 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 Now the ingredients and we do 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.240
 our meat stew today 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.280
 This is why we have that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.439
 Meat slightly cut and meat 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.049
 to Asia potatoes and dad 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.100
 a little bit bigger so it moved comparably 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:43.950
 time I give now 2 2 teaspoons oil 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:48.780
 in the pressure cooker I used for it 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.890
 a real teaspoon measured the likes on 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 dearest for weight watchers 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.579
 the admit bluejay already hot so 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.579
 I'll have the meat right away 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.519
 certain mediums do not use this 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.519
 on 2.5 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.180
 and meier 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.270
 the trains come compensated missed 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.780
 so 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.020
 the fixed line movie to guess with 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.020
 tackle 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.770
 I go from the economy 2 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.310
 and half a liter of liquid 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.310
 expected 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.710
 so the liquid is already costing a 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.440
 little is it this comes to it 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.880
 we're picking that out well 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.920
 if sometimes it hangs in such a way 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.050
 that I find my job quite serious 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.100
 apart 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.320
 That's why it's best in the cable 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.690
 get out and a bit angry because 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.440
 It just great thing to lose weight because 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.970
 The whole place is scary long 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.880
 is and you have not seen that so 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.530
 I really care about our worries 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.020
 accumulate 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:07.800
 and now I have those on top 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:09.150
 potatoes paprika and I will 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.730
 do not do it anymore 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.549
 then there was less power than meat 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.730
 with the sauerkraut now the lid 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.730
 it 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.580
 that was actually already 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.500
 we are waiting for the pressure 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.970
 pressure cooker on the pot you can see 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.070
 that their foundation is going but that is 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.360
 always a little bit different 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.910
 If you put pressure on it is five minutes 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.410
 with true cooking then we will cook the cooker 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.630
 off and then just still 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.070
 let more people always say that 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.390
 ten minutes another ten minutes then 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.790
 then everything would have to be quite good 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.990
 What I have to say is a pressure cooker 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.520
 who does not have that course in 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.230
 normal pot come no problem lasts 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.370
 and then just wait longer until the 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.890
 By no problem with the ingredients 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.620
 pressure cooker because it makes you 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.240
 may already during the kosovo war 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.980
 clean up what I think it's nice cameras 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.230
 not always but that I do not 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.160
 It's steaming out, it's all 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.390
 cleaner in the kitchen 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.390
 we show how it looks now 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.740
 the whole thing still needs to be touched and unmoved 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.789
 be tasted 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.449
 I still taste it with one 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:37.059
 good pinch of sugar from today sauerkraut 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:39.309
 The whole pot is a bit sour 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:06:03.810
 probably even salt or a gang 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:06:03.810
 What is not pure 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:36.229
 It is always special when it comes to weight 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:50.209
 watchers philosophy 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:53.929
 if you make such a buzz who to 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:55.999
 is it counted off somehow and are 

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:57.969
 There is so much to do with it and not 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:05.019
 another slice of pohl export and the 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:07.729
 vegetable cheese in it 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.629
 yes, if it has please give us 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.610
 again a dam break 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.869
 and if you do not have any more in the future 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.019
 want to fit in ours 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:17.509
