the scientists that I go to not too long
ago<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.670> he<00:01:33.789> said<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:35.110> because<00:01:35.439> you<00:01:35.680> are

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
ago and he said but because you are

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.620 
ago and he said but because you are
aging<00:01:36.610> now<00:01:36.820> at<00:01:37.180> 78<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:39.159> probably<00:01:39.700> are<00:01:40.329> going

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
aging now at 78 you probably are going

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.870 
aging now at 78 you probably are going
to<00:01:40.780> take<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.020> little<00:01:41.229> bit<00:01:41.350> slower<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.159> and

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
to take a little bit slower and and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.969 
to take a little bit slower and and
you're<00:01:43.479> wearing<00:01:43.899> your<00:01:44.170> knees<00:01:44.350> out<00:01:44.619> quicker

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
you're wearing your knees out quicker

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.219 
you're wearing your knees out quicker
then<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.640> should<00:01:45.850> have<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:46.570> do<00:01:46.840> not<00:01:47.020> be

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
then you should have and so do not be

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.730 
then you should have and so do not be

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
using any more stairs

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.950 
using any more stairs
