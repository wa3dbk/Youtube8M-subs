another<00:04:36.160> nice<00:04:36.340> thing<00:04:36.520> about<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.820> is<00:04:37.000> that

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
another nice thing about this is that

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.460 
another nice thing about this is that
they<00:04:37.480> actually<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.990> don't<00:04:38.139> have<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.320> get<00:04:38.440> a

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470

kind<00:04:59.020> of<00:04:59.110> go<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.380> flavors<00:04:59.860> so<00:04:59.890> let's<00:05:00.370> dive<00:05:00.550> in

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
kind of go of flavors so let's dive in

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.190 
kind of go of flavors so let's dive in
and<00:05:01.000> see<00:05:01.630> what<00:05:01.810> it's<00:05:01.930> all<00:05:02.050> about

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.780 

so<00:05:05.200> before<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.500> dig<00:05:05.770> in<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:05.980> start<00:05:06.190> eating

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
so before you dig in and start eating

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.390 
so before you dig in and start eating
you<00:05:07.660> should<00:05:07.810> always<00:05:07.960> just<00:05:08.080> taste<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:09.010> soup

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400

before some people are gonna add their

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.690 
before some people are gonna add their
own<00:05:10.870> stuff<00:05:11.169> I<00:05:11.470> think<00:05:11.860> if<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.100> ramen<00:05:12.370> museum

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
own stuff I think if the ramen museum

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.800 
own stuff I think if the ramen museum
though<00:05:12.820> there's<00:05:12.970> not<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.120> lot<00:05:13.300> on<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.510> tables

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
though there's not a lot on the tables

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.060 
though there's not a lot on the tables
there<00:05:13.930> because<00:05:14.140> they've<00:05:14.260> got<00:05:14.440> confidence<00:05:14.950> and

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
there because they've got confidence and

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.020 
there because they've got confidence and
their<00:05:15.160> broth<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:15.520> you're<00:05:15.639> not<00:05:15.729> gonna<00:05:15.850> have
