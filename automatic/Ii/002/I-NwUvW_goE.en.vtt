food glucose is the source of energy for
the<00:00:10.600> brain<00:00:10.780> its<00:00:11.050> fuel<00:00:11.350> for<00:00:11.680> your<00:00:11.710> mind<00:00:12.040> and<00:00:12.340> as

the brain its fuel for your mind and as

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.100 
the brain its fuel for your mind and as
it<00:00:12.670> turns<00:00:12.880> out<00:00:13.000> there<00:00:13.270> are<00:00:13.389> good<00:00:13.600> sugars<00:00:13.959> and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
it turns out there are good sugars and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.289 
it turns out there are good sugars and
some<00:00:14.590> not<00:00:14.740> so<00:00:14.889> good<00:00:15.070> sugars<00:00:15.459> and<00:00:15.639> we<00:00:16.059> just

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
some not so good sugars and we just

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.230 
some not so good sugars and we just
found<00:00:16.480> one<00:00:16.840> really<00:00:17.740> good<00:00:18.010> sugar<00:00:18.280> a<00:00:18.490> smart

having me I love learning about new
things<00:00:35.710> palatinus<00:00:36.310> I<00:00:36.430> haven't<00:00:36.760> heard<00:00:36.940> about

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
things palatinus I haven't heard about

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.020 
things palatinus I haven't heard about
it<00:00:37.390> smart<00:00:38.050> sugar<00:00:38.320> so<00:00:38.770> explain<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.430> me<00:00:39.580> we

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
it smart sugar so explain that to me we

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.340 
it smart sugar so explain that to me we
called<00:00:40.240> it<00:00:40.390> smart<00:00:40.630> sugar<00:00:40.810> because<00:00:41.110> it's<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
called it smart sugar because it's the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.620 
called it smart sugar because it's the
only<00:00:41.380> sugar<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.130> fully<00:00:42.550> digested<00:00:43.060> low

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
only sugar that is fully digested low

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.780 
only sugar that is fully digested low
glycemic<00:00:44.200> and<00:00:44.410> does<00:00:44.650> not<00:00:44.770> cost<00:00:45.010> with<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.370> K<00:00:45.520> oh

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
glycemic and does not cost with the K oh

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.390 
glycemic and does not cost with the K oh
and<00:00:46.330> it<00:00:46.960> provides<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.590> body<00:00:47.770> with<00:00:48.010> glucose

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
and it provides the body with glucose

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.950 
and it provides the body with glucose
which<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.790> vital<00:00:49.090> nutrient<00:00:49.480> as<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:49.780> just

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
which is a vital nutrient as you just

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.720 
which is a vital nutrient as you just
said<00:00:50.110> yourself<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:51.010> say<00:00:51.160> it<00:00:51.280> does<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.490> body

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
said yourself and you say it does a body

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.150 
said yourself and you say it does a body
good<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.510> like<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:53.020> nutritional<00:00:53.740> sugar<00:00:53.980> if

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
good it's like a nutritional sugar if

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.980 
good it's like a nutritional sugar if
you<00:00:54.280> will<00:00:54.460> it's<00:00:54.640> not<00:00:54.820> like<00:00:54.970> an<00:00:55.060> oxymoron<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.840> me

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
you will it's not like an oxymoron to me

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.720 
you will it's not like an oxymoron to me
first<00:00:56.500> I<00:00:56.620> think<00:00:56.680> we<00:00:56.830> have<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.100> understand<00:00:57.550> that

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
first I think we have to understand that

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.790 
first I think we have to understand that
you<00:00:57.880> need<00:00:58.120> energy<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.840> when<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.200> talk<00:00:59.380> energy

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
you need energy and when you talk energy

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.920 
you need energy and when you talk energy
we<00:01:00.190> talking<00:01:00.520> calories<00:01:00.970> from<00:01:01.090> food<00:01:01.360> ok<00:01:01.780> i<00:01:01.810> need

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
we talking calories from food ok i need

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.600 
we talking calories from food ok i need
a<00:01:01.990> reasonable<00:01:02.470> amount<00:01:02.560> that<00:01:03.310> your<00:01:03.430> body

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
a reasonable amount that your body

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.219 
a reasonable amount that your body
functions<00:01:04.089> your<00:01:04.330> brain<00:01:04.540> functions<00:01:05.019> and

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
functions your brain functions and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.920 
functions your brain functions and
actually<00:01:05.619> glucose<00:01:06.369> is<00:01:06.670> very<00:01:07.000> important<00:01:07.630> for

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
actually glucose is very important for

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.050 
actually glucose is very important for
that<00:01:08.110> glucose<00:01:08.830> is<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.040> only<00:01:09.250> energy<00:01:09.610> your

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
that glucose is the only energy your

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.910 
that glucose is the only energy your
brain<00:01:10.270> can<00:01:10.480> use<00:01:10.630> directly<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.590> also<00:01:11.800> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
brain can use directly it's also a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.560 
brain can use directly it's also a
direct<00:01:12.280> source<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.580> energy<00:01:12.700> for<00:01:12.910> your<00:01:13.210> muscles

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
direct source of energy for your muscles

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.170 
direct source of energy for your muscles
so<00:01:14.260> we're<00:01:14.440> talking<00:01:14.740> about<00:01:14.860> what<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.000> best

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
so we're talking about what is the best

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.180 
so we're talking about what is the best
way<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.510> provide<00:01:17.230> your<00:01:17.410> body<00:01:17.530> with<00:01:17.680> glucose

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
way to provide your body with glucose

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.800 
way to provide your body with glucose
and<00:01:18.430> when<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.700> think<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.060> energy<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.600> first

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
and when I think of energy the first

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.390 
and when I think of energy the first
thing<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.020> think<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.500> I'll<00:01:20.680> grab<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> can<00:01:21.280> of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
thing I think of is I'll grab a can of

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.950 
thing I think of is I'll grab a can of
soda<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:21.970> know<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.270> not<00:01:22.390> good<00:01:22.570> for<00:01:22.600> me<00:01:22.840> but

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
soda and I know it's not good for me but

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.390 
soda and I know it's not good for me but
if<00:01:23.080> I'm<00:01:23.230> tired<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.710> know<00:01:23.740> three<00:01:24.040> o'clock<00:01:24.250> in

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
if I'm tired you know three o'clock in

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.090 
if I'm tired you know three o'clock in
the<00:01:24.430> afternoon<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:25.150> get<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> high<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.710> energy<00:01:27.040> is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
the afternoon I get a high the energy is

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.340 
the afternoon I get a high the energy is
up<00:01:27.220> here<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.610> couple<00:01:27.909> hours<00:01:28.150> later<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.570> drop<00:01:29.020> yeah

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
up here a couple hours later I drop yeah

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.690 
up here a couple hours later I drop yeah
so<00:01:29.650> what's<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> difference<00:01:30.070> now<00:01:30.340> with<00:01:30.580> this

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
so what's the difference now with this

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.890 
so what's the difference now with this
one<00:01:30.880> that's<00:01:31.120> exactly<00:01:31.420> what<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:31.659> heard<00:01:31.840> from

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
one that's exactly what we heard from

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.620 
one that's exactly what we heard from
working<00:01:32.860> moms<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.310> states<00:01:33.640> where<00:01:33.940> we<00:01:34.479> did

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
working moms in the states where we did

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.719 
working moms in the states where we did
a<00:01:34.659> consumer<00:01:35.110> research<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:36.040> they<00:01:36.370> don't<00:01:36.490> like

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
a consumer research and they don't like

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.860 
a consumer research and they don't like
that<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.210> we're<00:01:37.330> they<00:01:37.450> looking<00:01:37.690> for<00:01:37.720> a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
that so we're they looking for a

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.450 
that so we're they looking for a
balanced<00:01:38.140> energy<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.740> that's<00:01:38.860> what<00:01:39.040> platanos

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
balanced energy and that's what platanos

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.700 
balanced energy and that's what platanos
provides<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.090> doesn't<00:01:40.360> cause<00:01:40.540> these<00:01:40.810> spikes

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
provides it doesn't cause these spikes

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.469 
provides it doesn't cause these spikes
in<00:01:42.010> your<00:01:42.130> blood<00:01:42.280> glucose<00:01:42.670> level<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.180> in<00:01:43.270> your

in your blood glucose level and in your

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.440 
in your blood glucose level and in your
in<00:01:43.659> your<00:01:43.720> insulin<00:01:44.229> level<00:01:44.560> um<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:46.240> gives

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
in your insulin level um and that gives

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.719 
in your insulin level um and that gives
you<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.690> more<00:01:46.990> steady<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.710> source<00:01:48.490> of<00:01:48.580> energy

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
you a more steady a source of energy

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.730 
you a more steady a source of energy
more<00:01:49.270> steady<00:01:49.510> fuel<00:01:49.840> for<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> body<00:01:50.260> so

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
more steady fuel for the body so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.080 
more steady fuel for the body so
throughout<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.190> day<00:01:51.340> throughout<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.970> day

for a longer period of time exilim and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.280 
for a longer period of time exilim and
your<00:01:54.850> body<00:01:55.030> can<00:01:55.270> use<00:01:55.570> that<00:01:55.720> energy<00:01:55.930> much

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
your body can use that energy much

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.770 
your body can use that energy much
better<00:01:56.530> now<00:01:57.070> how<00:01:57.250> does<00:01:57.310> pelota<00:01:58.120> knows<00:01:58.299> do<00:01:58.540> on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
better now how does pelota knows do on

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.780 
better now how does pelota knows do on
the<00:01:59.260> teeth<00:01:59.440> because<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.340> my<00:02:00.520> first

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the teeth because that is my first

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.280 
the teeth because that is my first
concern<00:02:00.970> when<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.299> think<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.600> myself<00:02:01.780> because<00:02:02.110> I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
concern when I think of myself because I

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.930 
concern when I think of myself because I
have<00:02:02.440> no<00:02:02.560> cavities<00:02:02.979> very<00:02:03.280> proud<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.610> tell<00:02:03.729> that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
have no cavities very proud to tell that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.109 
have no cavities very proud to tell that
and<00:02:04.150> my<00:02:04.869> kids<00:02:05.110> usually<00:02:05.830> tooth<00:02:06.310> decay<00:02:06.490> happens

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
and my kids usually tooth decay happens

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.479 
and my kids usually tooth decay happens
through<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.810> plug-in<00:02:08.409> which<00:02:09.009> sugars<00:02:09.280> are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
through the plug-in which sugars are

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.520 
through the plug-in which sugars are
broken<00:02:09.789> down<00:02:09.909> into<00:02:10.090> assets<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.780> as<00:02:11.290> putty

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
broken down into assets and as putty

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.739 
broken down into assets and as putty
nose<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.950> not<00:02:12.099> broken<00:02:12.549> down<00:02:12.790> into<00:02:12.969> assets<00:02:13.420> then

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.749 
nose is not broken down into assets then

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.449 
nose is not broken down into assets then
it<00:02:13.900> does<00:02:14.049> there's<00:02:14.379> no<00:02:14.560> attack<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.189> your<00:02:15.310> tooth

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
it does there's no attack to your tooth

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.759 
it does there's no attack to your tooth
animal<00:02:15.909> so<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.299> is<00:02:16.420> actually<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:17.139> good<00:02:17.469> sugar

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
animal so this is actually a good sugar

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.450 
animal so this is actually a good sugar
for

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
for

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.400 
for
as<00:02:18.700> well<00:02:18.850> because<00:02:19.240> at<00:02:19.450> night<00:02:19.630> if<00:02:19.990> they<00:02:20.200> have

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
as well because at night if they have

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.400 
as well because at night if they have
something<00:02:21.400> with<00:02:21.640> platanos<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.480> don't<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
something with platanos I don't think a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.930 
something with platanos I don't think a
they'll<00:02:23.740> have<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.130> energy<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.910> drives

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
they'll have that energy that drives

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
they'll have that energy that drives
them<00:02:25.300> crazy<00:02:25.360> let's<00:02:25.900> start<00:02:25.960> with<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
them crazy let's start with that and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.620 
them crazy let's start with that and
number<00:02:26.950> two<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.460> tooth<00:02:27.910> decay<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
number two the tooth decay so it's a

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.270 
number two the tooth decay so it's a
plus<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:28.930> kids<00:02:29.140> exactly<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:29.950> especially

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
plus for kids exactly and especially

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.890 
plus for kids exactly and especially
with<00:02:30.520> kids<00:02:30.550> we<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.180> they<00:02:31.420> don't<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
with kids we know they don't have the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.580 
with kids we know they don't have the
best<00:02:32.080> brushing<00:02:32.500> habits<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:34.180> might<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.200> easier

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
best brushing habits it might be easier

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.200 
best brushing habits it might be easier
maybe<00:02:35.770> at<00:02:35.950> nighttime<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.850> are<00:02:37.000> with

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
maybe at nighttime because you are with

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.910 
maybe at nighttime because you are with
them<00:02:37.420> many<00:02:37.750> throughout<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.200> day<00:02:38.380> it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
them many throughout the day it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920 
them many throughout the day it's
something<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.730> cannot<00:02:40.210> control<00:02:40.570> all<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
something you cannot control all the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.540 
something you cannot control all the
time<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.530> good<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.800> have<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.010> choice<00:02:42.250> for

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
time so it's good to have a choice for

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.220 
time so it's good to have a choice for
them<00:02:42.700> but<00:02:43.060> as<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.300> said<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.750> adults<00:02:43.900> that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
them but as you said for adults that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.780 
them but as you said for adults that
take<00:02:44.380> care<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.710> their<00:02:44.860> teeth<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.610> same

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
take care of their teeth is the same

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.790 
take care of their teeth is the same
thing<00:02:46.000> excellent<00:02:46.570> now<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:47.080> about<00:02:47.110> all

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
thing excellent now what about all

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.530 
thing excellent now what about all
natural<00:02:48.340> does<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.700> any<00:02:48.850> chemicals<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.450> it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
natural does it have any chemicals in it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.590 
natural does it have any chemicals in it
no<00:02:49.840> no<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.800> it's<00:02:51.430> exclusive<00:02:51.970> derived<00:02:52.390> from

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
no no it's it's exclusive derived from

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.290 
no no it's it's exclusive derived from
pure<00:02:52.930> beet<00:02:53.170> sugar<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.700> tastes<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.150> sugar

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
pure beet sugar it tastes like sugar

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.790 
pure beet sugar it tastes like sugar
tastes<00:02:55.630> like<00:02:55.750> sugar<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> ask<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.650> that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
tastes like sugar just to ask you that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.330 
tastes like sugar just to ask you that
it<00:02:57.130> occurs<00:02:57.550> naturally<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.180> honey<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.350> when<00:03:00.220> we

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
it occurs naturally in honey and when we

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.490 
it occurs naturally in honey and when we
look<00:03:00.460> at<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.760> process<00:03:01.000> how<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.450> make<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.050> it's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
look at the process how we make it it's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.410 
look at the process how we make it it's
the<00:03:02.620> same<00:03:02.800> process<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.310> know<00:03:03.700> from<00:03:04.150> other

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the same process you know from other

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.300 
the same process you know from other
food<00:03:04.810> making<00:03:05.050> like<00:03:05.500> bread<00:03:05.770> like<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.160> would

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
food making like bread like you would

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.670 
food making like bread like you would
like<00:03:06.490> either<00:03:06.670> beer<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.780> process<00:03:08.350> where<00:03:08.590> we

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
like either beer it's a process where we

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.470 
like either beer it's a process where we
use<00:03:08.800> little<00:03:08.980> enzymes<00:03:09.460> that<00:03:09.670> transform<00:03:10.330> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
use little enzymes that transform the
