that's<00:03:54.360> my<00:03:54.510> model<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:55.050> being<00:03:55.230> present<00:03:55.770> from

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
that's my model for being present from

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.760 
that's my model for being present from
the<00:03:56.070> 1800s<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.450> use<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:58.050> know<00:03:58.110> 21st

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
the 1800s I just use you know 21st

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.000 
the 1800s I just use you know 21st
century<00:03:59.130> technology<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.820> do<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> same<00:04:00.300> thing

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.589 

Facebook<00:04:06.010> has<00:04:06.040> done<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.340> think<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.730> good<00:04:07.060> job<00:04:07.569> of

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
Facebook has done I think a good job of

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.140 
Facebook has done I think a good job of
helping<00:04:08.050> people<00:04:08.230> create<00:04:08.680> communities<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.730> so

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
helping people create communities and so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.690 
helping people create communities and so
I<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:10.900> there<00:04:11.049> is<00:04:11.370> those<00:04:12.370> broader

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
I think there is those broader

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.490 
I think there is those broader
communities<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:13.510> on<00:04:13.629> a<00:04:13.659> campus<00:04:14.140> like<00:04:14.319> this

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
communities but on a campus like this

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.830 
communities but on a campus like this
where<00:04:14.709> there<00:04:14.830> are<00:04:14.980> about<00:04:15.190> 600<00:04:15.519> people<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.299> for

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
where there are about 600 people is for

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.509 
where there are about 600 people is for
me<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.049> easy<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.410> facilitate<00:04:17.949> community<00:04:18.340> as

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
me it's easy to facilitate community as

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.520 
me it's easy to facilitate community as
a<00:04:18.549> whole<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.060> we<00:04:19.180> do<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.510> through<00:04:19.570> some<00:04:20.440> of

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
a whole and we do that through some of

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.500 
a whole and we do that through some of
the<00:04:20.620> rituals<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:21.190> we<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.609> every<00:04:22.090> Thursday

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
this is how we're supposed to engage

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.219 
this is how we're supposed to engage
each<00:04:51.340> other<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.880> they<00:04:52.449> do<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.720> very<00:04:52.810> good<00:04:53.080> job

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229
