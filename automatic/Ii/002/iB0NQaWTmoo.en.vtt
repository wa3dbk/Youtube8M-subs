00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.820
 hello in this video I'm going to show you the 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.130
 best sun of an energy of 12 with each 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.340
 one of these cubes 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.680
 and I will show why the rubik is so 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.950
 bad and you do not have to buy it I'm going to 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.580
 do once with the wild down with 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.760
 the mailbox with the aurora with the falchi with 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.550
 the solar with the game 3 and finally with 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.750
 the rock is going to show him the best 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 time I take out with cable 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.150
 ah 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 i 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.350
 yes 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.490
 do not 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.470
 well before asking why not 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.239
 A) Yes 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.000
 I do not have any 57 millimeter sanchez 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.700
 I also like how it goes 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.890
 one of 55 how good is the gas itself 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.020
 but cover a hand like this we're 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.910
 loose and really ours very very 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.910
 similar to the cabochon and it is not necessary 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.910
 summarizing 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.230
 in cube tones and averaged between 13 and 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.800
 14 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.110
 abc 12 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.930
 Y 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:05.590
 in the ruiz says an old age 21 which is 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.960
 a lot of difference so it stays 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.070
 proved that this play really bad 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.700
 so the truth a third and good 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:21.280
 about quo because I was wondering which one 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.630
 it's my favorite it 's very cool what is it 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.310
 I like it more 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.970
 I feel poorer 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.490
 then the one I like the most is the one 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.390
 yang yang 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.390
 is this 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.320
 come on they have very good cut corners are 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.600
 pretty fast 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.280
 William is much faster so he has 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.750
 more cut corners than needles then 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.500
 put a little more stable a bit more 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.380
 region after this is the aurora the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.150
 chencho aurora I like it a lot but it has 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.280
 the problem that does not have clumsy or 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.340
 system in time so the pieces 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.280
 they come out very easily and I worry 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.900
 much later this is the son is only 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.350
 it wraps around a cube but I find it very 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.569
 slow 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.700
 the fake 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.989
 has the typical problem that is created 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.170
 corners but as a noisy medium no 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.260
 very fast and I do not like it very much 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.990
 after the gas 3 that many are 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.440
 asking lately for this cube I 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.420
 I find it horrible found very very 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.310
 very bad this game 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.290
 it's not bad they have the cut and the radio is 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.200
 but I do not like it at all 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.920
 blocks a lot too flexible and not 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.920
 four like 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.690
 nothing to say the meeting was not 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.490
 only to have 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.540
 so that would be I hope you have 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.699
 liked the video and do not forget to give it 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.250
 subscribe if they have not done so the 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.310
 currency every time I raise an ear and we 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.760
 we see in a next video that also 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760
 bye
