strips of wood and kind of make like a
little<00:00:14.309> tres<00:00:15.049> system<00:00:17.300> just<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> see<00:00:18.660> how<00:00:18.869> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
little tres system just to see how it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.609 
little tres system just to see how it
would<00:00:19.199> work<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:21.470> game<00:00:22.470> plan<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> staple

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
would work the game plan is a staple

would work the game plan is a staple
tarp<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.750> then<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.199> couple<00:00:28.529> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
tarp on it and then put a couple of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.100 
tarp on it and then put a couple of
eyelets<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.369> pair<00:00:30.619> say<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.960> on<00:00:33.960> the

eyelets a pair say one here and on the
other<00:00:34.200> side<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> bungee<00:00:35.130> cord<00:00:35.239> underneath<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
other side a bungee cord underneath the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049 
other side a bungee cord underneath the
boat<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> hold<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.260> place<00:00:37.670> maybe<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.940> in

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
boat to hold it in place maybe one in

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.750 
boat to hold it in place maybe one in
the<00:00:39.149> middle<00:00:39.360> somewhere<00:00:40.879> along<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> end<00:00:43.760> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the middle somewhere along the end and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.930 
the middle somewhere along the end and
then<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:46.460> hopefully<00:00:47.460> I'll<00:00:47.550> build<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
then that way hopefully I'll build it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:06.120 
then that way hopefully I'll build it
just<00:00:48.000> pick<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.629> thing<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:59.510> yes<00:01:01.340> we'll<00:01:02.340> see

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
thank you I cut these little edges flush

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.030 
thank you I cut these little edges flush
all<00:01:14.740> these<00:01:16.440> so<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.890> tarp<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:20.080> come<00:01:20.860> all

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
all these so that the tarp and come all

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.219 
all these so that the tarp and come all
the<00:01:21.070> way<00:01:21.190> around<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:22.000> staple<00:01:22.510> along<00:01:22.750> up<00:01:22.990> one

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
the way around and staple along up one

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
the way around and staple along up one
on<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.950> bottom<00:01:24.250> edge<00:01:24.460> all<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.820> way<00:01:24.970> along

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.780 

this<00:01:32.200> was<00:01:32.470> just<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.740> couple<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.160> hours<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
this was just a couple of hours the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.910 
this was just a couple of hours the
cutting<00:01:34.330> strips<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:34.930> throwing<00:01:35.710> something

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
cutting strips and throwing something

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.460 
cutting strips and throwing something
together<00:01:36.040> just<00:01:36.369> as<00:01:37.330> an<00:01:37.570> experiment

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
together just as an experiment

00:01:38.470 --> 00:02:01.270 
together just as an experiment
we'll<00:01:39.009> see<00:01:39.160> how<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.399> holds<00:01:39.700> up

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.649 

so<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> ran<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> time<00:02:02.790> yesterday<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.420> didn't

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
so I ran out of time yesterday I didn't

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.200 
so I ran out of time yesterday I didn't
get<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.869> finish<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.940> threw<00:02:06.180> some

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
get to finish and I just threw some

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.690 
get to finish and I just threw some
clamps<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.830> hold<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.130> tarp<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.490> place

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
clamps on to hold the tarp in place

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.090 
clamps on to hold the tarp in place
because<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.300> gonna<00:02:09.390> rain<00:02:09.660> today<00:02:10.380> but<00:02:13.100> what

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
because it was gonna rain today but what

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.890 
because it was gonna rain today but what
I'm<00:02:14.190> thinking<00:02:15.410> instead<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:17.900> actually

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
I'm thinking instead of actually

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.370 
I'm thinking instead of actually
stapling<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.830> down<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.930> think<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.989> might<00:02:22.170> just

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
stapling it down I think I might just

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.890 
stapling it down I think I might just
use<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.680> clamps<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:24.209> those<00:02:24.450> parts<00:02:24.870> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
use the clamps and then those parts that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.540 
use the clamps and then those parts that
I<00:02:25.050> said<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> was<00:02:25.470> kind<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.680> cut<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.160> might<00:02:26.340> just

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
I said I was kind of cut I might just

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.170 
I said I was kind of cut I might just
use<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.910> clamp<00:02:27.900> too<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> haven't<00:02:30.030> went

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
use that clamp too but I haven't went

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.280 
use that clamp too but I haven't went
there<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.660> one<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:35.840> I'd<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:36.900> four

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
there and I have one here I'd have four

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.640 
there and I have one here I'd have four
clamps<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.830> each<00:02:37.950> side<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:39.170> then<00:02:40.170> still<00:02:40.440> go

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
clamps on each side and then still go

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.110 
clamps on each side and then still go
with<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:41.600> bungee<00:02:42.600> cord<00:02:42.630> underneath<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
with a bungee cord underneath this is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.270 
with a bungee cord underneath this is
what<00:02:45.450> causes<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.140> problems<00:02:46.590> when<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.070> water

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
what causes the problems when the water

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.030 
what causes the problems when the water
pools<00:02:50.480> but<00:02:51.480> as<00:02:51.600> long<00:02:51.780> as<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.650> might<00:02:52.860> be

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
pools but as long as it it might be

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.280 
pools but as long as it it might be
alright

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.940 

I<00:02:57.319> got<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> little<00:02:58.550> test<00:02:58.879> run<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.569> major<00:03:00.530> storm

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
I got a little test run a major storm

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.000 
I got a little test run a major storm
coming<00:03:01.220> through<00:03:04.269> dropped<00:03:05.269> like<00:03:05.830> 15<00:03:06.830> degrees

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
coming through dropped like 15 degrees

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.480 
coming through dropped like 15 degrees
in<00:03:07.549> 15<00:03:08.060> minutes
