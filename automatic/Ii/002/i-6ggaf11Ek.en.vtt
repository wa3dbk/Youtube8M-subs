video we'll go into a little more detail
and<00:00:16.299> talk<00:00:16.450> about<00:00:16.690> how<00:00:16.780> you<00:00:16.840> can<00:00:16.990> control<00:00:17.410> the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
and talk about how you can control the

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.220 
and talk about how you can control the
dynamics<00:00:18.250> of<00:00:18.460> your<00:00:18.490> vocal<00:00:18.910> performance<00:00:19.390> who

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
dynamics of your vocal performance who

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.690 
dynamics of your vocal performance who
knows<00:00:20.410> what<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.680> future<00:00:20.830> will<00:00:21.040> bring<00:00:21.310> but

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
knows what the future will bring but

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.820 
knows what the future will bring but
currently<00:00:22.180> there<00:00:22.450> are<00:00:22.480> no<00:00:22.720> smart<00:00:23.230> microphones

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
currently there are no smart microphones

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.890 
currently there are no smart microphones
they<00:00:24.460> will<00:00:24.610> hear<00:00:24.820> only<00:00:25.000> what<00:00:25.420> they're<00:00:25.570> pointed

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
they will hear only what they're pointed

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.930 
they will hear only what they're pointed
at<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:26.680> if<00:00:26.800> it's<00:00:26.950> not<00:00:27.070> pointed<00:00:27.460> directly<00:00:27.550> at

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
at so if it's not pointed directly at

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.820 
at so if it's not pointed directly at
your<00:00:28.090> mouth<00:00:28.240> it's<00:00:28.630> not<00:00:28.840> hearing<00:00:29.170> exactly<00:00:29.710> what

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
your mouth it's not hearing exactly what

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.279 
your mouth it's not hearing exactly what
you<00:00:29.980> are<00:00:30.070> singing<00:00:30.340> or<00:00:30.700> saying<00:00:31.060> sounds<00:00:31.990> that

you are singing or saying sounds that
are<00:00:32.409> off<00:00:32.559> axis<00:00:33.249> will<00:00:33.519> be<00:00:33.550> amplified<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.089> little

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
are off axis will be amplified a little

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.630 
are off axis will be amplified a little
bit<00:00:34.600> but<00:00:34.899> will<00:00:35.109> not<00:00:35.320> be<00:00:35.499> as<00:00:35.620> clear<00:00:36.070> as<00:00:36.219> sounds

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640

sound so for clarity and volume you need

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.059 
sound so for clarity and volume you need
to<00:00:43.629> point<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.989> mic<00:00:44.140> directly<00:00:44.679> towards<00:00:44.949> your

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.069 
to point the mic directly towards your

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.279 
to point the mic directly towards your
mouth<00:00:45.249> and<00:00:45.519> keep<00:00:45.760> it<00:00:45.940> closed<00:00:46.269> it's<00:00:46.929> okay<00:00:47.229> for

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
mouth and keep it closed it's okay for

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.719 
mouth and keep it closed it's okay for
your<00:00:47.499> lips<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.920> touch<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.249> mic<00:00:48.399> grill

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
your lips to touch the mic grill

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:50.790 
your lips to touch the mic grill
remember<00:00:49.420> if<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.629> own<00:00:49.780> your<00:00:49.809> own<00:00:49.989> mic<00:00:50.289> you<00:00:50.589> and

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
remember if you own your own mic you and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.369 
remember if you own your own mic you and
only<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.370> sing<00:00:51.850> into<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.870> closer<00:00:53.139> you

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
only you sing into it the closer you

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.259 
only you sing into it the closer you
sing<00:00:53.679> into<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.889> microphone<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.639> louder<00:00:54.879> and

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
sing into the microphone the louder and

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.509 
sing into the microphone the louder and
fuller<00:00:55.629> your<00:00:55.960> voice<00:00:56.170> will<00:00:56.409> be<00:00:56.440> as<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.309> back

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
fuller your voice will be as you back

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.160 
fuller your voice will be as you back
off<00:00:57.760> or<00:00:58.089> turn<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.359> microphone<00:00:58.659> away<00:00:58.989> from

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
off or turn the microphone away from

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.469 
off or turn the microphone away from
your<00:00:59.319> mouth<00:00:59.440> your<00:01:00.159> voice<00:01:00.339> will<00:01:00.609> sound<00:01:00.850> quieter

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
your mouth your voice will sound quieter

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.719 
your mouth your voice will sound quieter
and<00:01:01.659> thinner<00:01:02.049> so<00:01:02.889> this<00:01:03.039> means<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.489> you<00:01:03.579> can

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
and thinner so this means that you can

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.030 
and thinner so this means that you can
control<00:01:04.089> your<00:01:04.270> vocal<00:01:04.660> volume<00:01:04.840> by<00:01:05.320> varying<00:01:05.890> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
control your vocal volume by varying the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.370 
control your vocal volume by varying the
angle<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:06.670> distance<00:01:07.120> to<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.360> microphone<00:01:07.900> this

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
angle or distance to the microphone this

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.990 
angle or distance to the microphone this
is<00:01:08.530> very<00:01:08.800> important<00:01:09.310> because<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.610> can<00:01:09.820> use

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
is very important because you can use

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.730 
is very important because you can use
this<00:01:10.210> technique<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.690> balance<00:01:11.140> your<00:01:11.290> voice<00:01:11.470> to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
electric guitar amp or a bass amp so it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.180 
electric guitar amp or a bass amp so it
has<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.300> be<00:02:33.390> amplified<00:02:33.630> many<00:02:34.170> times<00:02:34.470> more<00:02:34.830> than

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the mics on those instruments so if you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
the mics on those instruments so if you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
think about it the vocal mic will

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
think about it the vocal mic will
probably<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> most<00:02:40.350> sensitive<00:02:41.010> mic<00:02:41.340> on

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
probably be the most sensitive mic on

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.820 
probably be the most sensitive mic on
stage<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.240> therefore<00:02:42.900> more<00:02:43.140> liable<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> pick

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
stage and therefore more liable to pick

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
stage and therefore more liable to pick
up<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.310> sounds<00:02:44.670> around<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.480> body

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
when you have a full breath and then

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.710 
when you have a full breath and then
move<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.830> closer<00:03:32.160> as<00:03:32.460> you<00:03:32.490> run<00:03:32.820> out<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.090> breath

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
move it closer as you run out of breath

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.750 
move it closer as you run out of breath
this<00:03:34.080> gives<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.530> effect<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:35.010> maintaining<00:03:35.490> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
this gives the effect of maintaining the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.850 
this gives the effect of maintaining the
volume<00:03:36.210> of<00:03:36.420> your<00:03:36.480> sustain<00:03:36.990> note<00:03:37.260> even<00:03:37.710> though

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
volume of your sustain note even though

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.470 
volume of your sustain note even though
you're<00:03:38.010> physically<00:03:38.550> getting<00:03:38.760> quieter<00:03:39.330> as

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
you're physically getting quieter as

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.390 
you're physically getting quieter as
you're<00:03:39.660> running<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.170> breath<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.370> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
you're running out of breath this is a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.830 
you're running out of breath this is a
good<00:03:41.580> example<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:42.060> how<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.240> can<00:03:42.450> use<00:03:42.600> mic

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
good example of how you can use mic

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.020 
good example of how you can use mic
technique<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.380> control<00:03:43.500> your<00:03:44.040> sound<00:03:44.280> we'll<00:03:44.910> go

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
technique to control your sound we'll go

technique to control your sound we'll go
into<00:03:45.180> more<00:03:45.390> detail<00:03:45.750> on<00:03:45.780> mic<00:03:46.080> techniques<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
into more detail on mic techniques and

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.830 
into more detail on mic techniques and
we'll<00:03:47.070> talk<00:03:47.250> about<00:03:47.400> proximity<00:03:48.180> effect<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
we'll talk about proximity effect in the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.670 
we'll talk about proximity effect in the
