about<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.960> Contra<00:01:45.320> series<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.159> sense

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
about the Contra series is the sense

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.640 
about the Contra series is the sense
that<00:01:46.610> I've<00:01:46.729> really<00:01:47.300> gotten<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.720> know<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.440> game

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
that I've really gotten to know the game

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.710

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
at finishing it honestly I think it's

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.840 
at finishing it honestly I think it's
kind<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.200> ridiculous<00:01:54.800> that<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.340> original

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
kind of ridiculous that the original

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.660 
kind of ridiculous that the original
contra<00:01:56.330> appears<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.200> many<00:01:57.380> most<00:01:57.950> difficult

even<00:02:03.830> among<00:02:04.160> NES<00:02:04.759> games<00:02:05.119> it's<00:02:05.479> really<00:02:06.470> not<00:02:06.770> one

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
even among NES games it's really not one

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.100 
even among NES games it's really not one

and I'm not even particularly good at
them<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.920> yes<00:02:13.190> contra<00:02:13.700> games<00:02:13.910> are<00:02:14.150> hard<00:02:14.690> and

obvious difference is that your

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.640 
obvious difference is that your
horizontal<00:02:42.400> movement<00:02:43.400> speed<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:44.350> running<00:02:45.350> if

horizontal movement speed of running if
you<00:02:45.680> will<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.330> bit<00:02:47.660> slower<00:02:48.110> than<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
you will this is a bit slower than the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.750 
you will this is a bit slower than the
NES<00:02:49.070> games<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:50.360> you'll<00:02:50.600> get<00:02:50.810> used<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760

have provide inspiration for contra 4
and<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.560> few<00:04:26.800> other<00:04:26.980> areas<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.420> little
