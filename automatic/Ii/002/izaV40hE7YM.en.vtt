00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.169
 selective and were the main reasons 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.960
 They did enter our expensive company

 avoid accidents 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 all in a remote and centralized way 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.229
 using electronic resources of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.209
 telecommunications to measure what 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.229
 happens with the vehicles informing the 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:01.299
 our customers 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.620
 with this it interests the main 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.509
 Brazil problem today that it is 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.770
 growth and productivity this is the 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.539
 our main focus is to increase 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 productivity for our customer 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.969
 the letters the young man we have 15 years we have 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.759
 today in companies more than 20 thousand companies 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.700
 as customers and almost 250 thousand vehicles 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.469
 monitored and more than 10 000 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.270
 monitored loads per month 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.399
 one of the most important initiatives 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.710
 we have is the trainee program that 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.899
 aims to help people to create the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.450
 new generation of company leaders 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.490
 if it really seeks to shape our lives 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.770
 internally allowing them to have 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.859
 a broad view on the business 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.899
 we seek people motivated people well 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:44.079
 informed that they have a lot of 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.640
 to grow from learning and taking on 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.979
 responsibility having a lot of autonomy 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.380
 trainee to sascar in the model that the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.479
 people designed the program it's all 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.030
 focused on development for the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.399
 leadership is a path that the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.079
 trainee from the selection process to 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.759
 people follow the gaps and 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.880
 development that it needs to 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.399
 assume the role of leader in the company and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.960
 He defeated me during the process. 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.510
 floor where it goes through several 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.390
 boards he takes the project 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.250
 project that he has so 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.250
 start middle and end and it has a delivery 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.110
 very clear he has a mentor to the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.190
 over the whole period by one of the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 directors 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.700
 all this the direct accompaniment of 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.310
 human Resources 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.130
 whole process since the selection of the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.860
 trainee registration until the entry into the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.720
 company, the period of his defeat is chan 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.270
 to develop a leadership profile 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.850
 which is the profile of the system 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 do it he's from the model of works leave the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.170
 people carry out four projects that are 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 of the board of directors and we 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.430
 a coaching the one of the directors of the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.620
 company and this ends up developing 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.370
 much to us because we are 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.290
 talking about people extremely 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.220
 experienced people with a lot of knowledge 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.390
 Marketplace 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.550
 we also participate in a booty 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.110
 team putin that nothing is more than you 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.360
 spend time with our operations 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.170
 whether they are after-sales or 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.480
 commercial 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.730
 then the extremists distributed in 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.860
 all over the country from porto alegre reef 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.560
 Savior and we have the opportunity 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.300
 interesting to know our client 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.550
 to the field and learn a 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.780
 A little more in the program is tennis. 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.760
 these loads develops many 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.329
 characteristics between them 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.130
 self-confidence leadership and 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.900
 here I realized that you are the main 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.489
 responsible for its development which 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.470
 you go through great challenges the time 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.220
 whole and not afraid to err is 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.410
 essential 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.510
 the results depend very much on our 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.549
 We have a lot of autonomy here. 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.650
 inside to work to talk to the 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.150
 people to suggest ideas and run 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.489
 behind stocks 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.049
 so I believe that this visibility is 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.640
 a great differential project that 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.010
 I delivered the best result was the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.100
 also challenging in the sense that it was a 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.890
 comprehensive project was detected 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.690
 during the next one during the young 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.180
 was a pre-determined project then 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.380
 We had a change in the middle of this order 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.450
 the project we ended up involving 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.100
 various managements 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.440
 It was very worth having left my 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.579
 city for 2010 oscar for all 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.860
 difficulties that we have in a 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.780
 first moment but I think if you 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.549
 do not leave if you do not get new things 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.620
 If you do not leave the zone of your 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.150
 comfort you will never grow 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.519
 so I think you have the chance that I 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.810
 I have now I'm here to grow up. 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.950
 professionally and also to give 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.570
 pride for my family 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.910
 It's there from afar but it keeps on giving 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.390
 total support for the people who 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.400
 identify with acknowledgment 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.870
 challenge and result collaboration 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.820
 are those who must register in the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.100
 program are those people who 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.010
 they will probably be more successful here 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.750
 with the people that will be better evaluated 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.430
 and will be happier in the 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.990
 their homes for the near future to 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.120
 assume great responsibilities who 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.770
 knows a leadership arc because the 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.350
 challenges that we have been facing in the 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.920
 We are preparing for this day by day. 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.170
 my personal goal is that in short 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.270
 space of time, perhaps the successor of my 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.270
 successor sales trainee program
