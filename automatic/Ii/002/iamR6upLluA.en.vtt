and<00:01:13.220> while<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.369> still<00:01:14.640> wet<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.090> apply<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.630> next

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and while it's still wet I apply my next

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.770 
and while it's still wet I apply my next
mascara<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> Gloria<00:01:17.909> laughs<00:01:18.240> architect

mascara which is Gloria laughs architect
and<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.530> doesn't<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> lot<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> love

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and this doesn't get a lot of love

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.929 
and this doesn't get a lot of love
because<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.509> can't<00:01:21.780> flake<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
because it can't flake it's kind of

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
because it can't flake it's kind of
difficult<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> use<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.710> worth<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
difficult to use but it's worth it

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
difficult to use but it's worth it
because<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.729> gives<00:01:26.880> me<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.600> great

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810

mascara that I put on so there's there's
a<00:01:55.950> big<00:01:56.130> difference<00:01:56.310> already<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:58.560> would

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a big difference already and one would

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.200 
a big difference already and one would
be<00:01:58.860> fine<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> go

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
be fine with this but I'm going to go

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.890 
be fine with this but I'm going to go
one<00:02:00.540> step<00:02:00.810> further<00:02:01.490> okay<00:02:02.490> so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
one step further okay so

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.470 
one step further okay so
I<00:02:02.930> use<00:02:03.170> Diorshow<00:02:03.680> blackout<00:02:04.400> mascara<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.090> do<00:02:05.210> my

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
mascara that I put on because it's the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.520 
mascara that I put on because it's the
darkest<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.780> here's<00:02:11.780> how<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.020> do<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
darkest and here's how you do it you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.500 
darkest and here's how you do it you
just<00:02:12.560> close<00:02:12.980> your<00:02:13.010> eye<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.640> hold<00:02:14.030> your<00:02:14.270> brush

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
just close your eye and hold your brush

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.010 
just close your eye and hold your brush
horizontally<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.950> brush<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.150> tips<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.720> your

horizontally and brush the tips of your
eyelashes<00:02:18.620> upward<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.310> because<00:02:19.970> they

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
eyelashes upward and because they

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.790 
eyelashes upward and because they
already<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.630> product<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.290> them<00:02:21.500> from<00:02:21.710> the

other mascara that you've applied

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.220 
other mascara that you've applied
initially<00:02:24.260> it'll<00:02:25.070> help<00:02:25.430> them<00:02:25.960> stay<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:26.990> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
initially it'll help them stay in the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.740 
initially it'll help them stay in the
form<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.950> you're<00:02:28.100> curling<00:02:28.940> them<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.270> so

go sideways and then in the other
direction<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:56.050> there<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.450> again<00:02:59.450> I

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
direction and there it is so again I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.180 
direction and there it is so again I
could<00:03:00.020> have<00:03:00.050> stopped<00:03:00.440> when<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.680> got<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.070> this

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
could have stopped when I got to this

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.800 
could have stopped when I got to this
point<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.730> would<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:01.970> been<00:03:02.060> fine<00:03:02.300> but

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
point and that would have been fine but

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.900 
point and that would have been fine but
it's<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.260> easy<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.830> incorporate<00:03:04.130> this<00:03:04.640> last

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
