00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.520
 they were just friends, but then it came together 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.980
 so you realize that is something 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.230
 important to each other than just a friend or 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.259
 girlfriend probably everyone felt this 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.259
 standing we were friends so long ago she knew 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:30.259
 it he is better than anyone else how he 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.509
 from a half-word, I even understood the look 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.660
 enough to understand the reasons for her anger 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.850
 happiness is close when her whims 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.219
 you are pleased and you and Moscow are writing 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
 letters when there is no money for flowers and 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.450
 narcissus narwhal markers you 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.930
 present and surprises everything was small 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.960
 crackle 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.079
 mid-May, he wrote her mask himself 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.630
 me another I leave forever lower 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.850
 baby i don't like to forgive you just 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.950
 it happened 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.560
 pounded her fists not alone in his apartment 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.840
 but did not open the door there on the mobile 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.570
 gentle voice is somehow rude to court and 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.119
 astoria 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.360
 common friends don't know food not even 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.270
 heard of his love new sore feet 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 killing all rapids knew nothing in 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.860
 Institute at work to say that he quit 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 flew like who spoke to america who 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 I speak to Europe first gave freedom 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.950
 then for the heads of the trumpet who is this suffering 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 all parts nick she wilted shut up 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.180
 hated him with all my heart nervous 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.610
 disruption of clinics where it has lain for a very long time 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.900
 without visitors not allowing yourself to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.900
 friends are not parents 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 time passes silently bringing everything into the past 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.700
 what we managed to survive and summarize 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.310
 years passed she met another and he 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.709
 helped her to get on his feet because with him his 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.869
 joining my life and everything changed 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.469
 blessings of parents with god 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.140
 by grace 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.010
 they married loudly to the whole city 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.920
 played wedding was really great 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.020
 and live without and no one knows the end 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.960
 connection with a clean slate 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.840
 starting all and how many years she passed 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.410
 forgiven him let god judge him not even 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.530
 thought if you 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.290
 he is one day vista shit and and threshold 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 talking to him was a Jew 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.410
 interesting and like it would be necessary to finish 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.570
 this song for about five years was already 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.200
 daughter and not when came to me pc 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.110
 Guess from whom from it and yes it's almost 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.080
 ten years later he decided to remember 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.040
 to us with irony began to read fun but 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.280
 soon 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.720
 smile face gone she fell clenched hand 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.630
 as if he is 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.650
 hello honey if you read these lines 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.590
 you are good 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.920
 10 years ago, Draco failed to tell you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.600
 badly what decided to write went wolf 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.660
 said something last 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.170
 about the fact that he loved another so ridiculously ate 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.420
 without 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.790
 same summer and asked for now 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.520

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.980
 a life 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.320

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.090
 happy will i lied to you and not 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.090
 look for excuses rose 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.270
 our most difficult thing here is to hear 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.880
 your quiet sobbing behind the door believe this 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.300
 life feeling almost cried at night 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.500
 and that's all the doctors said 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.500
 I have a brain tumor 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.200
