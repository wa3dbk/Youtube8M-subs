00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169
 she gained prominence in the national media after attending an audience 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.210
 the legislative assembly of the Great Northern River last week in 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.089
 plenary made an account of the life of a 'teacher' in the Great Northern River 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.809
 exposed the reality that goes on inside and outside the classroom 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.750
 Yes, it is from the point of view of those who live with those who persist 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.060
 in favor of education 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 amanda gurgel portuguese teachers thank you for accepting our invitation 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 for those on the tv network but there are a lot of people getting interviewed drills 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.029
 they call ocepar there 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.329
 A little bit, the prestige of his to speak in the legislative assembly shows 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.810
 over there 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.030
 as people have many numbers 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.260
 and as I always say with the numbers are irrefutable I would also like to 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 present a number to start my room 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 which is a three-digit number that is very different from the numbers 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.600
 other numbers that were presented here with so many digits 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.790
 what's my salary number 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.900
 There are nine the three on a holiday. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.880
 nor basic salary 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.800
 amanda you have no shame in exposing your paycheck when 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.470
 you make it difficult with all the words 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.060
 now you would imagine that when you 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.440
 in this land of bench talk of those deputies talk to people too 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.250
 who were listening in every great river of the north 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.260
 the repercussion would be 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.640
 so big 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.800
 pm 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.850
 This is the most I imagined 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.079
 even because with the keep in place I have not spoken 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.329
 always harris that my routine routine are not mine 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.910
 but of all our category 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.370
 I never imagined that it could cause so much repercussion 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.049
 one thing that is so obvious 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690
 I do not believe that 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.720
 whichever is relevant 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.450
 not have been the fact that several of these considerations have 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.300
 been made 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920
 in that space that remains of the legislative assembly ms in that session until 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.900
 because much has already been said about the quality of teaching about 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.299
 difficulties you have 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.020
 beijing has basic structure inside classroom outside too 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.869
 but if there was much talk in the matter but the staff than the 'teacher' passione 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.620
 I also just got back from school inside the classroom on the back wanted to 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.079
 look for another job because only you can not live today 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.459
 you imagine seeing if you had already five points opened the accents and 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.169
 could spontaneously speak if he / she spoke 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.029
 we had problems 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.339
 spontaneously because it is so 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:32.369
 is to recognize what we talk about daily in schools in the 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:34.389
 time of the lethal interval than the people 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.129
 speak of the tired 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.930
 in the diary routine that you have to fill out 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.140
 it in the class that has to prepare of the proof that has corrected work that has 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 to propose 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.990
 then one of the buses that has to pick up then 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.749
 lastly that preparation was only 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:54.709
 talks about the routine about reality I do not think we can change something 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.649
 girls 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.649
 It's the best of everything without your report. 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.659
 I did not believe I saw much more repercussion 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 I believe that yes let people buy does not want not just one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.549
 mobilization 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.109
 only in virtual space 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.699
 if all those people who are identifying with what I say in that 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.299
 in that video that I said in that assembly 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.299
 with this team identify with this song that I 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.190
 said further 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.959
 then these people need to transform 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.309
 this feeling in action that beans collective action 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.170
 and not because of the side 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.999
 an artisan of all categories organized for the 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:41.170
 in the conquest of their rights to repercussion on the internet was enormous 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.510
 nor is today just what is spoken on twitter and other social networks you 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.060
 even has no other part as I already tried a known facet network and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.060
 I realize that they already have profiles with their name yes I knew I was worried 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.129
 inclusive and 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.669
 and I do not do not participate in these rules 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.409
 it's ironic to peic mind 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.980
 the flamengo faced in the time henrique may not have much cpf of who 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.040
 It's not part of this world, it's funny here. 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.209
 you certainly messed with a lot of people, and there are a lot of people admiring 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.060
 moment and that's why you're here today to talk a little more to these 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.810
 Filipino people until I finish this process I do not know what you want 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.660
 say what you want to speak prass not only for those students who do 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.320
 part of the term but like all others who participate 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.850
 in the municipal network of today's state network also has many difficulties 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.620
 your teachers 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.610
 I would like to say that 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.870
 none of this other than what I have exposed there in the form as exponent 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.190
 it would be possible 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.990
 if I did not have 90% of my category of which I am very proud to have a strike in that 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.759
 time 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.330
 so you say that 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.780
 this way we should stay 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.860
 until the governor rosalba 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.099
 has the ability to present a proposal that meets our 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.380
 claims 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.180
 it is no wonder that we have in terms of the organized action category should be 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.660
 inform to be present until then has no liquidity continues and accompanied 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.529
 in this strike was forced by the participation amanda 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.759
 Thank you very much month and awaits discussions.
