of the last two patches when you're out
of<00:00:20.640> ammo<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.420> gun<00:00:21.600> will<00:00:21.750> dry<00:00:21.990> fire<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.680> have

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
of ammo your gun will dry fire you have

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
of ammo your gun will dry fire you have
to<00:00:22.890> manually<00:00:23.220> reload<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.820> there's<00:00:24.060> no<00:00:24.150> more

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
to manually reload it there's no more

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
to manually reload it there's no more
automatic<00:00:24.630> reloads<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.740> has<00:00:25.920> made<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
automatic reloads and it has made the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.540 
automatic reloads and it has made the
gunfights<00:00:27.590> 10<00:00:28.590> times<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:29.099> intense<00:00:29.250> than

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
gunfights 10 times more intense than

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.980 
gunfights 10 times more intense than
they<00:00:29.670> were<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> saying<00:00:30.480> quite<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> lot

they were which is saying quite a lot

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
they were which is saying quite a lot
because<00:00:31.199> gunplay<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.710> rust<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.130> always

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because gunplay and rust was always

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.250 
because gunplay and rust was always
quite<00:00:32.790> intense<00:00:33.120> let's<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.809> ahead<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.200> a

where they hit to kind of get a sense of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.960 
where they hit to kind of get a sense of
what<00:01:02.820> type<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> gun<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.690> more<00:01:04.439> accurate<00:01:04.650> than

what type of gun is more accurate than

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
what type of gun is more accurate than
the<00:01:05.970> next<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> bolt<00:01:06.960> action<00:01:07.110> on

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the next I don't have a bolt action on

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
the next I don't have a bolt action on
me<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.490> an<00:01:08.790> AK<00:01:09.119> let's<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.659> ahead

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
me but we do have an AK let's go ahead

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
me but we do have an AK let's go ahead
and<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> look<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> AK<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.799> well<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and take a look at the AK as well so you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
and take a look at the AK as well so you
see<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> AK<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.500> more

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
see that the AK is a little more

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.240 
see that the AK is a little more
consistent<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.150> fully<00:01:16.080> auto<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
consistent if we do fully auto the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.649 
consistent if we do fully auto the
grouping<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> lot<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.119> consistent<00:01:18.630> than

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
grouping is a lot more consistent than

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
grouping is a lot more consistent than
the<00:01:18.810> Thompson<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> grouping<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> AK

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the Thompson so the grouping on the AK

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
the Thompson so the grouping on the AK
is<00:01:20.460> still<00:01:20.759> superior<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.840> sights<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> AK<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
is still superior the sights on the AK I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.990 
is still superior the sights on the AK I
think<00:01:23.009> our<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:24.119> hard<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:26.549> remote<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
think our are hard to be the remote and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.420 
think our are hard to be the remote and
the<00:01:27.030> AK<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> quicker<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.950> slower<00:01:29.250> than<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the AK is quicker it's slower than the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
the AK is quicker it's slower than the
Thompson<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.110> rack<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
Thompson because you have to rack the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.280 
Thompson because you have to rack the
slide<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:32.280> well<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> clip<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.290> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
slide as well as put the clip in and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
slide as well as put the clip in and
then<00:01:35.220> let's<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.430> ahead<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.670> take<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.850> look<00:01:36.000> at

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
then let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.670 
then let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
when it's out of ammo it is pretty damn

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.649 
when it's out of ammo it is pretty damn
cool<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.240> cylinder

bullet<00:02:04.320> by<00:02:04.439> bullet<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.009> almost<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.399> though

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
bullet by bullet it's almost as though

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.219 
bullet by bullet it's almost as though
he<00:02:05.700> has<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> speed<00:02:06.149> loader<00:02:06.329> which<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.079> pretty

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
he has a speed loader which is pretty

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.309 
he has a speed loader which is pretty
cool<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:11.009> has<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:12.030> added<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.959> much<00:02:13.110> more

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
cool and it has just added so much more

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.790 
cool and it has just added so much more
to<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.380 
to the
density<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.370> encounters<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.030> terms<00:02:15.210> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
density of the encounters in terms of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
density of the encounters in terms of
the<00:02:15.810> gunplay<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.920> shotgun<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.880> haven't

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the gunplay the shotgun we haven't

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.850 
the gunplay the shotgun we haven't
played<00:02:18.300> around<00:02:18.450> too<00:02:18.690> much<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.620> let's<00:02:19.740> go

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
played around too much with but let's go

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.200 
played around too much with but let's go
ahead<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.070> take<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> look<00:02:20.490> at<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.180> can

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
ahead and take a look at that you can

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.450 
ahead and take a look at that you can
see<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.510> reloading<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.200> shotgun<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
see that reloading the shotgun is the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.670 
see that reloading the shotgun is the
slowest<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.970> them<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.240> at<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.510> point<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
slowest of them all at this point and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.570 
slowest of them all at this point and
but<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.090> spread<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.690> shotgun<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:29.310> spread

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
but the spread of the shotgun the spread

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.900 
but the spread of the shotgun the spread
of<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.790> shotgun<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.890> fairly<00:02:31.890> consistent<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
of the shotgun is fairly consistent and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.190 
of the shotgun is fairly consistent and
it<00:02:33.510> covers<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.760> good<00:02:35.760> range<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> shotgun<00:02:37.020> is

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
it covers a good range so the shotgun is

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.120 
it covers a good range so the shotgun is
a<00:02:37.230> great<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.220> um<00:02:39.470> pray<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.620> spray<00:02:40.710> type

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.440 
a great you know um pray and spray type
weapon<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:41.760> great<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.180> Close<00:02:42.420> Encounters

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
the guns a little bit we didn't want to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.010
