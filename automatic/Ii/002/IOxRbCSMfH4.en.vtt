to<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.320> smaller<00:01:04.979> goals<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.700> will

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to make some smaller goals that will

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
goals so if you want to lose weight then

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.240 
goals so if you want to lose weight then
you<00:01:11.159> could<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> smaller<00:01:13.470> goal<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you could have as a smaller goal to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.910 
you could have as a smaller goal to
first<00:01:14.610> lose<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.270> pounds<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.200> stay<00:01:16.890> on

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
first lose two pounds and then stay on

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.210 
first lose two pounds and then stay on
the<00:01:17.189> new<00:01:17.939> weight<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> while<00:01:19.259> after<00:01:20.070> which

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the new weight for a while after which

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
the new weight for a while after which
you<00:01:20.400> will<00:01:20.610> try<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> lose<00:01:21.270> another<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:22.110> pounds

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you will try to lose another two pounds

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.490 
you will try to lose another two pounds
of<00:01:22.909> course<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.509> more<00:01:24.570> than<00:01:25.140> one

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of course you can have more than one

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.039 
of course you can have more than one
macro<00:01:25.799> goal<00:01:26.250> although<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> often<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
macro goal although it is often a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
macro goal although it is often a
problem<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.799> most<00:01:29.040> people<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.729> combine<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
problem for most people to combine a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
problem for most people to combine a
couple<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.840> goals<00:01:31.110> together<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:32.040> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
couple of goals together because some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.090 
couple of goals together because some
goals<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.540> together<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:34.229> well<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
goals can go together very well and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340 
goals can go together very well and
others<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.659> help<00:01:36.930> each<00:01:37.110> other

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
others will really not help each other

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.149 
others will really not help each other
out<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.860> losing<00:01:38.790> weight<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> gaining<00:01:40.530> muscle

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
out so losing weight and gaining muscle

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.030 
out so losing weight and gaining muscle
muscle<00:01:41.880> together<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.600> often<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> big<00:01:43.470> problem

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
muscle together is often a big problem

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.550 
muscle together is often a big problem
for<00:01:44.100> most<00:01:44.549> people<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.659> brings<00:01:46.020> me<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
for most people which brings me to the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.130 
for most people which brings me to the
next<00:01:46.740> point<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.869> goals

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
next point and this is that your goals

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.370 
next point and this is that your goals
have<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.950> realistic<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.020> got<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
have to be realistic so for that I got a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
have to be realistic so for that I got a
couple<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.100> questions<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.329> well

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.679 

and<00:01:58.009> first<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.189> these<00:01:59.340> questions<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.119> worthy

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and first of these questions is worthy

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.380 
and first of these questions is worthy
is<00:02:00.810> 10<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.829> what<00:02:02.429> is<00:02:02.549> your<00:02:02.700> current<00:02:03.030> level

hundred meters or do you have to learn
that<00:02:08.910> first<00:02:09.679> second<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.799> how<00:02:11.099> long<00:02:11.340> will<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that first second is how long will it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.509 
that first second is how long will it
take<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.239> do<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.750> make<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.519> realistic

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
take you do you make a realistic

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.850 
take you do you make a realistic
estimate<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.629> how<00:02:15.959> much<00:02:16.140> time<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:16.799> take

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
estimate of how much time it will take

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.610 
estimate of how much time it will take
you<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.250> reach<00:02:18.000> your<00:02:18.239> goal<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:18.989> running<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
you to reach your goal so running a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.430 
you to reach your goal so running a
marathon<00:02:19.799> by<00:02:20.670> only<00:02:20.940> training<00:02:21.690> for<00:02:21.959> one<00:02:22.140> month

marathon by only training for one month

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.460 
marathon by only training for one month
of<00:02:22.709> course<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.519> not<00:02:23.879> realistic<00:02:24.299> do<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.260> have

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
of course is not realistic do you have

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.589 
of course is not realistic do you have
the<00:02:25.590> right<00:02:25.739> equipment<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.940> equipments

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
the right equipment because equipments

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.710 
the right equipment because equipments
are<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:27.989> important<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.830> apart<00:02:29.640> from

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
are very important and apart from

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.970 
are very important and apart from
equipments<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.840> should<00:02:31.049> also<00:02:31.200> check<00:02:31.829> if

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
equipments you should also check if

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.369 
equipments you should also check if
you've<00:02:32.190> got<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.670> ability<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.299> take<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.170> right

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
you've got the ability to take the right

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.589 
you've got the ability to take the right
nutrition<00:02:35.040> because<00:02:35.190> without<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.180> good

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
nutrition because without the good

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.420 
nutrition because without the good
amount<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.019> calories<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.769> might<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.160> be<00:02:38.310> able

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
amount of calories you might not be able

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.059 
amount of calories you might not be able
to<00:02:38.610> reach<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.540> goal<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:40.110> gaining<00:02:40.500> muscle

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
to reach the goal like gaining muscle

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.300 
to reach the goal like gaining muscle
for<00:02:41.280> example<00:02:41.819> are<00:02:42.810> your<00:02:43.079> goals<00:02:43.440> combined<00:02:44.010> able

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
for example are your goals combined able

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.030 
for example are your goals combined able
so<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.269> want<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.599> gain<00:02:45.900> flexibility<00:02:46.709> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
so if you want to gain flexibility and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.509 
so if you want to gain flexibility and
gain<00:02:47.879> muscle<00:02:48.360> how<00:02:48.569> realistic<00:02:49.379> is<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:50.280> you

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
gain muscle how realistic is it that you

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.339 
gain muscle how realistic is it that you
will<00:02:50.730> succeed<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.359> both<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.810> those<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
will succeed in both of those and

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.130 
will succeed in both of those and
finally<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.579> enter<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.629> this<00:02:54.870> means

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
finally can you enter it so this means

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860 
finally can you enter it so this means
that<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.769> shouldn't<00:02:56.190> try<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.609> do<00:02:57.239> things<00:02:57.690> that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that you shouldn't try to do things that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.599 
that you shouldn't try to do things that
you<00:02:58.049> really<00:02:58.410> don't<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.859> because<00:02:59.280> eventually

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
you really don't like because eventually

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.860 
you really don't like because eventually
you<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.239> probably<00:03:00.540> give<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.379> up

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.380 

the<00:03:04.590> final<00:03:05.040> main<00:03:05.250> question<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.060> have<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the final main question that you have to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.199 
the final main question that you have to
ask<00:03:06.600> yourself<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.500> what<00:03:07.530> suits<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.700> with

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
ask yourself is what suits you and with

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.600 
ask yourself is what suits you and with
that<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> mean<00:03:09.900> do<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.380> like<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.800> swim<00:03:11.040> or<00:03:11.430> run

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
that I mean do you like to swim or run

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.400 
that I mean do you like to swim or run
or<00:03:11.880> lift<00:03:12.150> weights<00:03:12.450> because<00:03:12.720> if<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.170> don't

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
or lift weights because if you don't

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.740 
or lift weights because if you don't
then<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:13.740> definitely<00:03:14.580> don't<00:03:14.940> recommend<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.690> to

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
then I definitely don't recommend you to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800 
then I definitely don't recommend you to
do<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.980> telling<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.940> any<00:03:18.360> kind<00:03:18.630> of

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
do so are you telling it in any kind of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.559 
do so are you telling it in any kind of
sport<00:03:19.200> because<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.580> very<00:03:21.000> bad<00:03:21.270> at<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
sport because if you are very bad at the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.870 
sport because if you are very bad at the
sport<00:03:21.930> then<00:03:22.260> eventually<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.310> might<00:03:23.520> you

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
sport then eventually you might you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.870 
sport then eventually you might you
might<00:03:24.090> stop<00:03:24.569> liking<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:26.310> sometimes

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
might stop liking it so so sometimes

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.640 
might stop liking it so so sometimes
it's<00:03:27.150> better<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.480> choose<00:03:27.900> something<00:03:28.200> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
it's better to choose something that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.320 
it's better to choose something that
you're<00:03:28.860> good<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.340> rather<00:03:29.670> than<00:03:29.970> something

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you're good at rather than something

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.930 
you're good at rather than something
that<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.840> want<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.200> be<00:03:31.319> good<00:03:31.560> at<00:03:31.739> without<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that you want to be good at without the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.630 
that you want to be good at without the
chance<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.510> succeeding<00:03:34.069> can<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.220> combine<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
chance of succeeding can you combine it

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.240 
chance of succeeding can you combine it
with<00:03:35.820> your<00:03:36.390> daily<00:03:36.840> activity<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.739> if<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.100> are

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
with your daily activity so if you are

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.250 
with your daily activity so if you are
studying<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.150> become<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.480> doctor<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.140> will

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
studying to become a doctor you will

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.530 
studying to become a doctor you will
probably<00:03:40.560> need<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.070> study<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.880> lot<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.209> hours

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
probably need to study a lot of hours

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.600 
probably need to study a lot of hours
each<00:03:42.780> week<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.440> will<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.800> still<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.280> time

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
each week so will you still have time

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.240 
each week so will you still have time
left<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.239> do<00:03:45.630> some<00:03:45.989> training<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> marathon

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
left to do some training for a marathon

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.460 
left to do some training for a marathon
which<00:03:47.940> will<00:03:48.180> also<00:03:48.390> take<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.810> lot<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.050> hours

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
which will also take you a lot of hours

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.979 
which will also take you a lot of hours
each<00:03:49.709> week<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.459> finally<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:51.569> your<00:03:51.780> body

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
each week and finally it's your body

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.830 
each week and finally it's your body
composition<00:03:52.519> suited<00:03:53.519> for<00:03:53.700> your<00:03:53.880> goals<00:03:54.150> with

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
composition suited for your goals with

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.530 
composition suited for your goals with
that<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> mean<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.860> some<00:03:56.580> people<00:03:57.000> might<00:03:57.330> be

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
that I mean that some people might be

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.470 
that I mean that some people might be

sport like gymnastics and a very tall

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.050 
sport like gymnastics and a very tall
person<00:04:03.989> might<00:04:04.680> not<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.190> suited<00:04:05.670> for

gymnastics whereas a shorter person

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.319 
gymnastics whereas a shorter person
might<00:04:09.930> be<00:04:10.140> less<00:04:10.380> soon<00:04:10.650> suited<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.820> do<00:04:11.970> some

basketball on a higher level and there

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.770 
basketball on a higher level and there
are<00:04:16.680> some<00:04:16.890> goals<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.609> can<00:04:17.880> try<00:04:18.720> to

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
are some goals that you can try to

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.990 
are some goals that you can try to
achieve<00:04:19.289> for<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> certain<00:04:20.070> sport<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.729> if<00:04:20.850> you

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
achieve for a certain sport so if you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.600 
achieve for a certain sport so if you
are<00:04:21.150> into<00:04:21.510> sprinting<00:04:22.169> or<00:04:22.440> athletics<00:04:22.979> then

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
are into sprinting or athletics then

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.730 
are into sprinting or athletics then
gaining<00:04:24.000> muscle<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:24.660> strength<00:04:24.840> as<00:04:25.380> well<00:04:25.590> as

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
gaining muscle and strength as well as

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.550 
gaining muscle and strength as well as
increasing<00:04:26.280> speed<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.240> some<00:04:27.780> flexibility

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
increasing speed and some flexibility

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.010 
increasing speed and some flexibility
might<00:04:29.190> be<00:04:29.370> useful<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:30.630> are<00:04:30.780> a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
might be useful and if you are a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.950 
might be useful and if you are a
football<00:04:32.010> or<00:04:32.039> soccer<00:04:32.460> player<00:04:32.940> then<00:04:33.270> insurance

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
football or soccer player then insurance

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.620 
football or soccer player then insurance
and<00:04:34.200> some<00:04:34.680> strength<00:04:35.160> might<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.820> important<00:04:36.450> and

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
and some strength might be important and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.250 
and some strength might be important and
muscle<00:04:37.350> gain<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.890> also<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.729> possibility<00:04:39.260> for

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
muscle gain is also a possibility for

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.440 
muscle gain is also a possibility for
those<00:04:40.740> who<00:04:40.979> practice<00:04:41.310> football<00:04:41.820> or<00:04:42.180> soccer

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
those who practice football or soccer

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.050 
those who practice football or soccer
although<00:04:43.289> if<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.740> are<00:04:43.770> playing<00:04:44.370> football<00:04:44.729> or

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
although if you are playing football or

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.270 
although if you are playing football or
soccer<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.930> really<00:04:46.440> not<00:04:46.590> realistic<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
soccer it is really not realistic to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.310 
soccer it is really not realistic to
think<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.880> you<00:04:48.060> can<00:04:48.210> also<00:04:48.360> work<00:04:48.780> out<00:04:49.020> your

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
think that you can also work out your

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.770 
think that you can also work out your
flexibility<00:04:50.010> for<00:04:50.370> example<00:04:50.880> your<00:04:51.090> hamstrings

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
flexibility for example your hamstrings

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.200 
flexibility for example your hamstrings
because<00:04:52.039> with<00:04:53.039> these<00:04:53.430> sports<00:04:53.850> your

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
because with these sports your

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.080 
because with these sports your
hamstrings<00:04:54.810> are<00:04:55.020> shortened<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.729> the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
hamstrings are shortened because of the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.360 
hamstrings are shortened because of the
fact<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:58.110> will<00:04:58.289> help<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.710> reduce<00:04:59.220> the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
fact that this will help you reduce the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.590 
fact that this will help you reduce the
chance<00:04:59.640> of<00:04:59.820> getting<00:05:00.120> injured

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
chance of getting injured

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.590 
chance of getting injured
so<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:01.169> flexible<00:05:01.979> soccer<00:05:02.310> player<00:05:02.700> might<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.360> at

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
so a flexible soccer player might be at

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.440 
so a flexible soccer player might be at
a<00:05:04.169> higher<00:05:04.440> risk<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:05.070> getting<00:05:05.130> injured<00:05:05.669> another

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
a higher risk of getting injured another

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.020 
a higher risk of getting injured another
example<00:05:07.140> would<00:05:07.289> be<00:05:07.350> for<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:08.220> runner<00:05:08.880> a

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
example would be for a runner a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.960 
example would be for a runner a
long-distance<00:05:09.870> runner<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:11.250> really<00:05:11.760> don't

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
long-distance runner this really don't

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.959 
long-distance runner this really don't
need<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.479> big<00:05:12.930> amount<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.800> muscle<00:05:14.280> mass

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
need a big amount of muscle mass

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.869 
need a big amount of muscle mass
and<00:05:15.059> a<00:05:15.619> bodybuilder<00:05:16.619> doesn't<00:05:17.309> really<00:05:17.549> need

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
and a bodybuilder doesn't really need

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.049 
and a bodybuilder doesn't really need
any<00:05:18.149> good<00:05:18.649> endurance<00:05:19.649> for<00:05:20.129> long<00:05:20.399> distances

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:21.059 
any good endurance for long distances

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.029 
any good endurance for long distances
because<00:05:21.269> it<00:05:21.719> is<00:05:21.839> unlikely<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.469> they<00:05:22.829> will

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
because it is unlikely that they will

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.769 
because it is unlikely that they will
start<00:05:23.909> to<00:05:23.999> run<00:05:24.329> marathons<00:05:26.149> so<00:05:27.149> there<00:05:27.360> are<00:05:27.509> some

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
start to run marathons so there are some

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.959 
start to run marathons so there are some
good<00:05:28.079> goals<00:05:28.319> that<00:05:28.529> you<00:05:28.679> can<00:05:28.709> combine<00:05:29.339> and<00:05:29.639> I

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
good goals that you can combine and I

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.479 
good goals that you can combine and I
gave<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:30.719> four<00:05:31.139> of<00:05:31.349> these<00:05:31.559> like<00:05:31.949> losing

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:32.489 
gave you four of these like losing

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:34.699 
gave you four of these like losing
weight<00:05:32.699> and<00:05:32.939> increasing<00:05:33.360> endurance<00:05:33.899> gaining

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:34.709 
weight and increasing endurance gaining

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.409 
weight and increasing endurance gaining
strength<00:05:34.979> and<00:05:35.399> muscle<00:05:35.939> mass<00:05:36.119> together

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
strength and muscle mass together

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.779 
strength and muscle mass together
gaining<00:05:37.199> muscle<00:05:37.619> gaining<00:05:37.949> strength<00:05:38.369> and

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
gaining muscle gaining strength and

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.179 
gaining muscle gaining strength and
gaining<00:05:39.239> speed<00:05:39.599> will<00:05:40.079> go<00:05:40.349> together<00:05:40.739> pretty

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
gaining speed will go together pretty

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.879 
gaining speed will go together pretty
well<00:05:41.579> and<00:05:41.819> gaining<00:05:42.659> strength<00:05:42.959> increasing

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
well and gaining strength increasing

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.369 
well and gaining strength increasing
speed<00:05:44.279> and<00:05:44.549> some<00:05:45.329> increasing<00:05:46.110> some

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
speed and some increasing some

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
speed and some increasing some
flexibility<00:05:47.159> might<00:05:47.429> also<00:05:47.610> be<00:05:47.999> a<00:05:48.209> good<00:05:48.569> way<00:05:48.869> to

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:49.399 
flexibility might also be a good way to

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.549 
flexibility might also be a good way to
maximize<00:05:50.399> your<00:05:50.879> ability<00:05:51.719> to<00:05:51.749> achieve<00:05:52.169> these

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:52.559 
maximize your ability to achieve these

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.329 
maximize your ability to achieve these
goals<00:05:54.379> there<00:05:55.379> are<00:05:55.499> some<00:05:55.799> more<00:05:55.949> of<00:05:56.009> these

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
goals there are some more of these

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.029 
goals there are some more of these
combinations<00:05:56.909> but<00:05:57.779> I<00:05:58.139> just<00:05:58.559> gave<00:05:58.739> you<00:05:59.009> a

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
combinations but I just gave you a

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.399 
combinations but I just gave you a
couple<00:05:59.549> of<00:05:59.759> those<00:06:00.179> to<00:06:00.449> think<00:06:00.809> about<00:06:01.079> it<00:06:01.229> and

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
couple of those to think about it and

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.799 
couple of those to think about it and
there<00:06:01.919> are<00:06:01.949> some<00:06:02.309> some<00:06:02.849> goals<00:06:03.149> that<00:06:03.389> will<00:06:03.599> not

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:03.809 
there are some some goals that will not

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.049 
there are some some goals that will not
combine<00:06:04.289> together<00:06:04.649> that<00:06:05.159> well<00:06:05.429> like<00:06:05.699> gaining

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:06.059 
combine together that well like gaining

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.319 
combine together that well like gaining
muscle<00:06:06.509> and<00:06:06.599> increasing<00:06:07.379> endurance

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:08.329 
muscle and increasing endurance

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:10.399 
muscle and increasing endurance
increasing<00:06:09.329> speed<00:06:09.719> and<00:06:09.929> increasing

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:12.809

these kind of goals you will use

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.889 
these kind of goals you will use

endurance and gaining muscle because
muscle<00:06:25.169> endurance<00:06:25.349> exercises<00:06:26.159> are<00:06:26.550> often<00:06:27.059> a

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:27.239 
muscle endurance exercises are often a

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:29.540 
muscle endurance exercises are often a
lot<00:06:27.539> different<00:06:28.019> than<00:06:28.229> gaining<00:06:29.009> muscle

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
lot different than gaining muscle

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.059 
lot different than gaining muscle
exercises<00:06:30.089> and<00:06:30.569> also<00:06:31.019> gaining<00:06:31.439> muscle<00:06:31.829> and

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
exercises and also gaining muscle and

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.040 
exercises and also gaining muscle and
gaining<00:06:32.489> flexibility<00:06:33.300> is<00:06:33.389> pretty<00:06:33.749> difficult

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
gaining flexibility is pretty difficult

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.850 
gaining flexibility is pretty difficult
because<00:06:35.149> try<00:06:36.149> and<00:06:36.569> better<00:06:36.779> develop<00:06:37.409> muscles

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
because try and better develop muscles

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.089 
because try and better develop muscles
have<00:06:38.279> a<00:06:38.639> higher<00:06:38.999> smuzzle<00:06:39.629> tone<00:06:40.110> and<00:06:40.409> this<00:06:40.860> will

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
have a higher smuzzle tone and this will

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.219 
have a higher smuzzle tone and this will
naturally<00:06:41.759> decrease<00:06:42.509> the<00:06:42.779> amount<00:06:42.869> of

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
naturally decrease the amount of

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.639 
naturally decrease the amount of
flexibility<00:06:43.889> in<00:06:44.129> that<00:06:44.429> particular<00:06:45.059> muscle

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:45.649 
flexibility in that particular muscle

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.559 
flexibility in that particular muscle
