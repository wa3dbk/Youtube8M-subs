00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 in the summer we often don't know what 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 bring to the table because there at least hot 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.639
 in my house it drastically reduces the meat 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.050
 so you need something fancy 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 tease of appetite 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.150
 so I thought of a classic cake 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.609
 salted with lots of vegetables and without 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 eggs and with cheese together like 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.269
 prepare them at home 230 ingredients 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.220
 grams of ready-made puff pastry 200 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.720
 grams of stringy cheese 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 type fontina 200 g of peppers 200 g of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.920
 zucchini 200 g of carrots 200 g of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.820
 cherry tomatoes 200 g of potatoes salt pepper 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.860
 oregano 20 grams of breadcrumbs 30 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.920
 g grated parmesan 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.809
 extra virgin olive oil I brought 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.760
 ahead as usual it is already cleansed 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 all the vegetables also diced 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.309
 small little ones for example we can 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.620
 take some pepper tomatoes 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 red and yellow carrots of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.600
 zucchini and also cut potatoes 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.890
 just diced 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.299
 meanwhile the cheese puffs are 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.860
 still in the fridge otherwise with this 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.100
 case it melts everything then you fail 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.290
 more to handle in a pan I have 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 poured 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.790
 let's warm up a little and then wait 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.259
 about 30 seconds 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.259
 so let's combine all the vegetables 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.460
 then let the free hard jump 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.510
 adding salt pepper and flavorings as to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.360
 example or island and we remove the vegetables 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.530
 for about 5 6 minutes 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.480
 the important thing is to brown them in this 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.790
 phase because then we will finish cooking 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.760
 naturally in the meantime fit for 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.860
 heat the oven to 200 degrees 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.470
 I took an atelier with a diameter of 28 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.230
 26 cm 28 in short, based on what 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.210
 you have what you want to have 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.160
 omitted puff pastry however you can 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.450
 use brisÃ¨ or pasta, of course 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.940
 also salted pastry and do 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 a nice strate rello with cheese a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.360
 I have chosen pasta and cheese 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.640
 fontina and I cut into slices 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.050
 thin thin with my spectator a 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:33.260
 house or let it cool a little 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.260
 vegetables add parmesan cheese 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.330
 we mix and then towards the whole 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.330
 inside the pastry 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.780
 we dust the surface with del 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.330
 grated bread to make au gratin 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.740
 see you don't need eggs anyway 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:06.540
 slice will remain in a hurry 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:09.150
 you will see then we keep down the edges of the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.840
 our browse clearly if we take 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.380
 a smaller series we will have more pasta 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.250
 puff in excess of bucherer ciampa 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.750
 call then to taste the dough because 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.230
 prick to prevent it from swelling 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.530
 too much if instead you want it to swell 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.100
 avoid pricking off at the bottom of 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.420
 200 degrees for about 40 minutes 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.060
 today I am boys I proposed a 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.550
 classic that you can serve hot or 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.850
 cold here I have already cut a slice and 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.980
 you can see the inside of the beauty is that 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.200
 the vegetables remain compact even without 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.390
 in short, I have only done one 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.490
 example choosing the vegetables that best me 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.230
 like them but you can also add 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.300
 of the capers olives 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.950
 or even beans and so on 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.260
 snap of your imagination in the kitchen 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.090
 and have fun creating personalize 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.800
 your favorite savory pie 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.540
 put a thumb up if you have 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.540
 welcome is a greeting to all hello
