I<00:00:21.060> right<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.430> software<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:26.250> dark

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I right now so just software is the dark

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.730 
I right now so just software is the dark
of<00:00:26.760> music<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.250> so<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.260> gonna<00:00:31.590> be

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
of music and so that so now we gonna be

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.000 
of music and so that so now we gonna be
doing<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.640> many<00:00:33.030> airplanes<00:00:34.010> designing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
doing here is many airplanes designing

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
doing here is many airplanes designing
them<00:00:35.280> i'm<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> add<00:00:36.809> any<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.469> we're

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
them i'm going to add any more as we're

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.930 
them i'm going to add any more as we're
anything<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.520> designing

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
anything we're going to be designing

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.750 
anything we're going to be designing
them<00:00:39.300> which<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.440> most<00:00:41.070> important<00:00:41.730> part

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
them which is the most important part

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.510 
them which is the most important part
that<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.510> designing<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> you'll<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.280> go

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that you in designing so you'll have go

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
that you in designing so you'll have go
to<00:00:44.579> google<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.000> search<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.570> google<00:00:45.930> sketchup

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to google and search on google sketchup

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.440 
to google and search on google sketchup
then<00:00:46.980> you'll<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.219> able<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> find<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.030> offered

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it so here we are inside google sketchup

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.090 
it so here we are inside google sketchup
um<00:00:57.199> some<00:00:58.199> chunk<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.430> here<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.079> hold<00:01:01.890> of

um look so fresh so start with this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
um look so fresh so start with this
circle<00:01:16.799> tool<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:19.340> we're<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:20.900> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
circle tool and we're gonna make this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:33.950 
circle tool and we're gonna make this
about<00:01:22.799> uh<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:27.740> um<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:30.350> 16<00:01:31.350> feet<00:01:31.799> long<00:01:32.960> so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
about uh about um about 16 feet long so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
about uh about um about 16 feet long so
now<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.390> up<00:01:37.079> take<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
now we're going to do is up take this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
now we're going to do is up take this
pencil<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:40.759> I'm<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.970> draw<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> straight

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
pencil and I'm gonna draw a straight

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
pencil and I'm gonna draw a straight
line<00:01:42.689> across<00:01:44.450> over<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> therefore<00:01:48.770> parts

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
line across over here so therefore parts

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.850 
line across over here so therefore parts
of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> airplane<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:51.090> LM<00:01:51.689> want<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.500> other
