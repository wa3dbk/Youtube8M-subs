 the girls team last year 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.110
 I clicked from 15 it was complicated to 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.190
 manage because of the short program and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.950
 here I do not have 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.480
 I did not want to relive the same thing as 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.560
 last year where I have girls that 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.700

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.850
 who 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.720
 choices to make but they have made themselves 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.630
 naturally girls have left 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.360
 the host team stopped their 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.220
