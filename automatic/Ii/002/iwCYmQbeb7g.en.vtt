00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.470 

all<00:00:06.770> right<00:00:06.920> so

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.660 

it's<00:00:11.690> a<00:00:11.780> to<00:00:11.930> UI<00:00:12.140> system<00:00:12.650> where<00:00:13.070> the<00:00:13.340> first<00:00:13.550> shoe

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
it's a to UI system where the first shoe

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.590 
it's a to UI system where the first shoe
is<00:00:13.820> whatever<00:00:14.120> is<00:00:14.540> free<00:00:15.400> razors<00:00:16.400> done<00:00:16.880> an

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
is whatever is free razors done an

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.620 
is whatever is free razors done an
optimized<00:00:18.140> media<00:00:18.950> library<00:00:19.610> you<00:00:20.240> know<00:00:20.330> has<00:00:20.510> the

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
optimized media library you know has the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
optimized media library you know has the
ability<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.369> sort<00:00:22.369> through<00:00:22.550> games

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.290 

so

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
so

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.960 
so
the<00:00:29.050> ability<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.410> browse<00:00:29.949> routines<00:00:30.490> very

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
the ability to browse routines very

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.120 
the ability to browse routines very
quickly<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.689> basically<00:00:32.290> within<00:00:32.529> one<00:00:32.860> country

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
quickly and basically within one country

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.690 
quickly and basically within one country
walk<00:00:33.460> away

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
walk away

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.830 
walk away
right<00:00:37.910> bees<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.240> can<00:00:39.390> look<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.600> movie

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
right bees and you can look at movie

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.400 
right bees and you can look at movie
trailers<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:41.570> well<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.780> guys<00:00:42.930> maybe<00:00:43.140> aren't

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
trailers like well you guys maybe aren't

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.210 
trailers like well you guys maybe aren't
into<00:00:43.620> movie<00:00:43.980> trailers

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.990 

so<00:00:48.020> if<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.290> set<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.310> I<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> launch

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so if I set up the Wi-Fi I get to launch

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
so if I set up the Wi-Fi I get to launch
world<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.330> warcraft<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:52.440> impressive<00:00:52.830> demo

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
world of warcraft very impressive demo

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.760 
world of warcraft very impressive demo
without<00:00:53.400> Wi-Fi<00:00:54.090> won't<00:00:54.360> even<00:00:54.540> boot<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.079> I'll<00:00:55.590> do

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
without Wi-Fi won't even boot so I'll do

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.400 
without Wi-Fi won't even boot so I'll do
maybe<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.840> craft<00:00:57.840> create<00:00:58.200> perfect<00:00:58.800> choice

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.740 

you<00:01:04.040> see<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.370> keyboard<00:01:04.550> has<00:01:05.059> automatically

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
you see the keyboard has automatically

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.330 
you see the keyboard has automatically
switched<00:01:06.140> based<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.650> detecting<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:07.220> we

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
switched based on detecting that we

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.980 
switched based on detecting that we
launched<00:01:07.520> Warcraft<00:01:08.060> them<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.450> Warcraft

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
launched Warcraft them to a Warcraft

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.030 
launched Warcraft them to a Warcraft
theme<00:01:09.230> 40<00:01:09.710> which<00:01:11.560> maybe<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:12.770> all<00:01:12.920> that

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
theme 40 which maybe it's all that

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.100 
theme 40 which maybe it's all that
impressive<00:01:13.370> but<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.820> certainly<00:01:14.240> continued<00:01:15.080> a

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
impressive but it certainly continued a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.690 
impressive but it certainly continued a
fever<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:18.650> now<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.100> know<00:01:19.190> this<00:01:19.310> people<00:01:19.520> were

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
fever so now you know this people were

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.230 
fever so now you know this people were
consciously<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.510> use<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.440> control

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
consciously to use to control

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.450 
consciously to use to control
touchscreens<00:01:24.170> double-click

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:49.480 

so<00:01:31.970> let's<00:01:32.300> see

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.630 

No

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.219 

Oh

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.380 

so<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.460> cinematics<00:02:06.090> for

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so as you can see the cinematics for

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
so as you can see the cinematics for
this<00:02:06.509> gate<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:07.079> not<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.530> choppy<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.399> slow

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
this gate or not you know choppy or slow

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.199 
this gate or not you know choppy or slow
or<00:02:09.149> cut<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.950> there<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> an<00:02:11.280> internal<00:02:11.730> speaker

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
or cut up there is an internal speaker

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:25.070 
or cut up there is an internal speaker
but<00:02:12.390> we're<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:17.629> usually

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:34.260 

pretty<00:02:25.710> much

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.570 

technology

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.820 

and<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> ability<00:02:41.510> now

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.030 

so<00:02:49.510> here<00:02:50.510> we<00:02:50.630> are<00:02:50.660> frozen<00:02:51.170> groan<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:54.040> just

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
so here we are frozen groan and I just

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.210 
so here we are frozen groan and I just
tackled<00:02:55.610> her<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.970> my<00:02:56.180> control<00:02:56.720> team<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.350> I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
tackled her to my control team and I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.960 
tackled her to my control team and I
have<00:02:58.460> obviously<00:02:59.180> very<00:02:59.420> familiar<00:02:59.630> controls<00:03:00.970> in

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
have obviously very familiar controls in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.339 
have obviously very familiar controls in
fact<00:03:02.270> maps<00:03:02.540> directly<00:03:03.200> from<00:03:03.500> your<00:03:03.710> screen<00:03:04.010> or

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
fact maps directly from your screen or

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.619 
fact maps directly from your screen or
even<00:03:06.069> attack<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.340> use<00:03:09.549> these<00:03:09.819> cursors

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
even attack I can just use these cursors

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.099 
even attack I can just use these cursors
to<00:03:11.280> move<00:03:12.280> around<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.639> map<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.510> don't<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:13.989> much

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
to move around the map I don't have much

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.160 
to move around the map I don't have much
exposure<00:03:14.469> way<00:03:14.829> ahead<00:03:15.719> and<00:03:16.719> use<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.989> mouse

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
exposure way ahead and use the mouse

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.670 
exposure way ahead and use the mouse
keyboard<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:19.780> really<00:03:20.049> could<00:03:20.260> be<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.379> lot<00:03:20.560> of

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
keyboard it's really could be a lot of

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.050 
keyboard it's really could be a lot of
things<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:20.980> different<00:03:21.159> people<00:03:21.310> depending<00:03:21.700> on

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
things to different people depending on

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.949 
things to different people depending on
the<00:03:22.120> being<00:03:22.329> here<00:03:24.329> so

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the being here so

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.880 
the being here so
menu<00:03:28.269> I'll<00:03:29.269> go<00:03:29.450> back<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.290> keyboard<00:03:30.769> using

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
menu I'll go back to the keyboard using

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.720 
menu I'll go back to the keyboard using
the<00:03:31.099> chat

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.190 

then<00:03:37.209> when<00:03:37.330> we<00:03:37.420> quit<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.720> game<00:03:37.840> come<00:03:38.050> back

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
then when we quit the game come back

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.890 
then when we quit the game come back
from<00:03:38.379> our<00:03:38.620> UI<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.340> able<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:42.150> say<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.390> need<00:03:43.870> a

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
from our UI and able to say I need a

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.020 
from our UI and able to say I need a
Wi-Fi<00:03:44.290> connection<00:03:44.610> which<00:03:45.610> has<00:03:45.790> been

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
Wi-Fi connection which has been

00:03:46.030 --> 00:04:00.710 
Wi-Fi connection which has been
particularly

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:23.140 

what

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.709 

so

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.039 

I<00:04:30.059> think<00:04:31.059> you<00:04:31.149> can<00:04:31.299> actually<00:04:31.419> get<00:04:31.629> a<00:04:31.689> sweet

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:32.049 
I think you can actually get a sweet

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:34.169 
I think you can actually get a sweet
side<00:04:32.289> of<00:04:32.409> the<00:04:32.469> cold<00:04:32.619> war<00:04:32.830> crafts<00:04:33.129> layout<00:04:33.879> on

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:34.179 
side of the cold war crafts layout on

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:36.570 
side of the cold war crafts layout on
the<00:04:34.809> cycling<00:04:35.199> demo<00:04:35.439> until<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.099> see<00:04:36.339> basically

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the cycling demo until you see basically

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.899 
the cycling demo until you see basically
your<00:04:36.969> entire<00:04:37.269> action<00:04:38.259> bars<00:04:38.619> laid<00:04:38.979> out<00:04:39.159> I<00:04:39.489> think

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
your entire action bars laid out I think

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.609

00:04:41.619 --> 00:05:00.380 
would be on your screen basically across
your<00:04:41.949> piece

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.770

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:43.690
