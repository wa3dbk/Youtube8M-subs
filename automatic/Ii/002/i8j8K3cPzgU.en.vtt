link<00:00:08.700> down<00:00:08.910> below<00:00:08.970> but<00:00:09.300> essentially<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.050> one

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
link down below but essentially it's one

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.650 
link down below but essentially it's one
of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> fitness<00:00:10.710> trackers<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.910> am<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.480> big

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
of the fitness trackers that I am a big

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.480 
of the fitness trackers that I am a big
fan<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.320> made<00:00:13.500> up<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:13.980> parts<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
fan of and it's made up of two parts the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.210 
fan of and it's made up of two parts the
fitness<00:00:15.030> tracker<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.139> band<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:17.010> there's

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
fitness tracker and the band but there's

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.679 
fitness tracker and the band but there's
a<00:00:17.279> problem<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.920> that<00:00:19.920> problem<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:21.660> that

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
a problem and that problem is that that

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.380 
a problem and that problem is that that
band<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.529> damaged<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> also<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.269> get

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
band can get damaged and also it can get

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.939 
band can get damaged and also it can get
a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.689> boring<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.170> there's<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> solution

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
a little boring so there's a solution

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.060 
a little boring so there's a solution
you<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.630> spend<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.619> money<00:00:28.830> on

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you go out and you spend some money on

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
you go out and you spend some money on
replaceable<00:00:29.849> colored<00:00:30.300> bands<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.380> what

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
replaceable colored bands which is what

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
replaceable colored bands which is what
I<00:00:31.740> went<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.460> actually<00:00:32.730> wanted<00:00:33.180> just

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
I went for and I actually wanted just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.350 
I went for and I actually wanted just
one<00:00:33.719> band<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> red<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
one band that that was the red one but I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
one band that that was the red one but I
was<00:00:36.480> forced<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> buy<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.040> pack

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
was forced to kind of buy them in a pack

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.440 
was forced to kind of buy them in a pack
of<00:00:38.219> three<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.030> sell<00:00:39.270> them

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
of three because they don't sell them

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.110 
of three because they don't sell them
individually<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.129> retails<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
individually here now this retails for a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000 
individually here now this retails for a
hundred<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> forty<00:00:43.140> five<00:00:43.290> Durham's<00:00:43.800> which

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
hundred and forty five Durham's which

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.959 
hundred and forty five Durham's which
quits<00:00:44.309> -<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.640> 25<00:00:45.329> pounds<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.559> bad<00:00:46.969> but

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
quits - about 25 pounds it's not bad but

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.779 
quits - about 25 pounds it's not bad but
it<00:00:48.329> doesn't<00:00:49.110> give<00:00:49.890> us<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> option<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
it doesn't give us the option to just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.130 
it doesn't give us the option to just
purchase<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> means<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
purchase one it means that you have to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.889 
purchase one it means that you have to
purchase<00:00:52.670> three<00:00:53.670> essentially<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.629> go

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
purchase three essentially in one go

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.270 
purchase three essentially in one go
plus<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> currently<00:00:56.070> have

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
plus the one that you currently have

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
plus the one that you currently have
which<00:00:57.030> means<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> end<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.899> four

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
which means that you end up with four

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
which means that you end up with four
bands<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.160> too<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.550> in<00:01:00.390> my

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bands it's a little too much in my

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.360 
bands it's a little too much in my
opinion<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.440> anyway<00:01:01.710> let<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.160> show<00:01:02.340> you

compared<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.189> another<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
compared with one another but this is a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
compared with one another but this is a
red<00:01:10.140> tangerine<00:01:10.860> color<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.909> I

that<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.950> strap<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.729> you're

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that in you just strap it on and you're

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
that in you just strap it on and you're
good<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.530> cool<00:01:46.979> thing<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.549> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
good to go and the cool thing about this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.910 
good to go and the cool thing about this
is<00:01:48.180> Fitbit<00:01:48.689> has<00:01:48.780> paid<00:01:49.049> attention<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.560> details

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
is Fitbit has paid attention to details

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.980 
is Fitbit has paid attention to details
so<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> double<00:01:51.270> tap<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so when you double tap to get the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.340 
so when you double tap to get the
progress<00:01:52.860> bar<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:54.090> change<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:55.049> are

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
progress bar they change or they are

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
progress bar they change or they are
kind<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.189> showing<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> based<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> color

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
kind of showing you based on the color

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
kind of showing you based on the color
of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> band<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.200> well<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.579> good

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
of the band as well really really good

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.660 
of the band as well really really good
the<00:02:00.600> only<00:02:00.840> thing<00:02:01.079> about<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:01.950> bands<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the only thing about these bands is the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.520 
the only thing about these bands is the
fact<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.810> last

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
fact that you know if they don't last

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
fact that you know if they don't last
very<00:02:04.680> long<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> wear<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
very long with with the kind of wear and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.520 
very long with with the kind of wear and
tear<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.930> I've<00:02:07.409> noticed

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
tear that I've noticed

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.740 
tear that I've noticed
I've<00:02:09.070> had<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.369> band<00:02:09.550> for<00:02:09.790> about<00:02:10.030> three<00:02:10.600> months

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
I've had the band for about three months

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.200 
I've had the band for about three months
now<00:02:10.960> my<00:02:11.650> original<00:02:12.040> black<00:02:12.250> band<00:02:12.490> but<00:02:12.820> that's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
now my original black band but that's

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.570 
now my original black band but that's
been<00:02:13.450> through<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.990> fair<00:02:14.860> bit<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:15.370> that's

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
been through a fair bit so that's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.780 
been through a fair bit so that's
possibly<00:02:16.000> why<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:17.590> kind<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.220> got<00:02:18.370> damaged

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
possibly why it's kind of got damaged

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.450 
possibly why it's kind of got damaged
but<00:02:19.300> essentially<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.080> nice<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.310> have

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
but essentially it's nice to have

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.190 
but essentially it's nice to have
replaceable<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.300> nice<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.720> have<00:02:22.840> colored

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
replaceable and nice to have colored

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.700 
replaceable and nice to have colored
bands<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:25.450> only<00:02:25.720> downside<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.650> is

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
bands and the only downside to this is

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.170 
bands and the only downside to this is
that<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.310> purchase<00:02:27.490> essentially

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
that you have to purchase essentially

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.810 
that you have to purchase essentially
two<00:02:28.630> others<00:02:29.020> plus<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.040> want<00:02:30.280> in

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
two others plus the one that you want in

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.730 
two others plus the one that you want in
order<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.240> get<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.810> color<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.230> want<00:02:32.320> so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
order to get the color that you want so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.380 
order to get the color that you want so
that's<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.100> downside<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.850> all<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.240> all

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
that's the downside but all in all

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.330 
that's the downside but all in all
really<00:02:34.780> good<00:02:35.020> purchase<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.830> not<00:02:35.980> bad<00:02:36.130> for

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
really good purchase it's not bad for

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.490 
really good purchase it's not bad for
money<00:02:36.520> either<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.000> that's<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.050> Fitbit

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
money either and that's it the Fitbit

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.600 
money either and that's it the Fitbit
flex<00:02:38.680> color<00:02:39.550> band<00:02:40.030> options
