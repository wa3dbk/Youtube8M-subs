00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello to everyone from the axis of the Margil codex 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.689
 Satan's wife Satan today you 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.860
 I will tell you how to get very 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.039
 simply 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.939
 do something on the video 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.919
 momentik 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.249
 which do you think would be cool 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.749
 very cool 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.960
 slow down the Kremlin diet 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.970
 she is 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.130
 everything is what 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 someone all very just let you in 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.630
 movie or leads the same as watching 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.669
 think about fatal already know how to add 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.640
 video 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.980
 percentage of workers and in the working platform 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.500
 but each pair of trauma calls offices 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.180
 never mind 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.370
 let's say you added a video and want 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.030
 let's say there is little in this moment called 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 for example 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.790
 want ooo start to be found a 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.020
 then to speed up his video 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.360
 nutrition problem is very simple 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.840
 press the button right on the boy 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.980
 on the mouse 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.160
 that's how i am 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.120
 but you see caviar grows here 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.660
 the name of the saints 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.720
 enceladus 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.430
 here 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.200
 this one 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.260
 square 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 logged in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.990
 press 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 and you see an accent 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.220
 strip that shows 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.050
 sales 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 neutral ie percentage 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 this is a video which is in its 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.730
 standard condition 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.410
 percent 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.610
 so say the workers 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.910
 here 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.130
 buying price is essentially what speed into it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.470
 standards 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.820
 this neutral position 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.350
 as we begin to change it e 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.200
 position rinsed 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.040
 goalkeeper strips 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.620
 then change speed and change 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 very simple here you see the point here 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.360
 and not the one here 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.510
 points that means you can 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.420
 so here are the points beacons to put estimates 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.949
 where you need to speed up where you need to change 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.269
 and the video that is, do not hesitate 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.979
 let's say I want to see the region 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.299
 this place we press the right button 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.469
 as usual on 0 4 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.999
 and more 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.049
 on the game 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.439
 this dress is a destination point 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.679
 change video speed 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.509
 here you saw there 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.799
 worse it is along this line let's say we add 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.680
 here look hugs raising and gone 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.869
 speeds up and video 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.079
 and here let's put it down 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 lt's a point 2 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.519
 here and the speed drops now consider how 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.869
 he and how much do I hate them 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.599
 if the evaluation person sings slowly 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.230
 no wonder copper on this speed video 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.310
 increased truth king of speed 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.099
 as i said above too low 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.480
 down and the speed lane now 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.989
 gradually increase the prices you 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.749
 see how he moves fast and plays 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.049
 naturally sings 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.849
 it's very easy to change speed 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.319
 video 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.199
 per year and for those who cover km 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.709
 what may there 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.979
 still simple options to know her I will tell 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.039
 you so 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.829
 how much does Oleg cost me this one 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.569
 the strictest option is the easiest to know about 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.029
 what that is there and push the buttons and 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.499
 the speed will change as a percentage 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.979
 from the date option I used well 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.199
 in principle, we donâ€™t remember him 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.509
 teach him not to show no 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.719
 I will show that option that more often all 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.359
 policies I consider this option the most 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.979
 reliable and convenient 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.239
 and you can see immediately accepted 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.180
 changes 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.299
 when installing the future of the region where you stand 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.000
 we do not see the powder, and where it stands a little 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.020
 reduce speed and increase everyone 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.069
 Thank you for your attention 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.959
 this short video 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.479
 Irina acts something new on herself 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.509
 learned 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.229
 here I will ask questions 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.249
 and meets the form of video lessons 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.209
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.059
 bye everyone
