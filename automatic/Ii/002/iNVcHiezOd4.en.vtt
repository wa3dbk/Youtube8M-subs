00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.950

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.810
 tells motorists that parking 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.170

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.030
 and how important it is to take an example 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.190
 that's probably the inspector 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.430
 which fights 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.430
