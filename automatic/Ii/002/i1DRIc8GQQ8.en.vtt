to<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.420> as<00:03:36.510> well<00:03:36.540> also<00:03:37.380> if<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.470> push

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
to do that as well also if you push

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.100 
to do that as well also if you push
forward<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.190> other<00:03:38.520> way<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.270> have<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
forward the other way you have the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.080 
forward the other way you have the
winter<00:03:40.560> mode<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.489> will<00:03:41.610> be<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:41.910> you're

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
winter mode on so that will be if you're

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.930 
winter mode on so that will be if you're
in<00:03:42.270> rain<00:03:42.540> or<00:03:42.810> ice<00:03:43.020> or<00:03:43.290> snow<00:03:43.410> mode<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.820> will

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
in rain or ice or snow mode so it will

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.850 
in rain or ice or snow mode so it will
basically<00:03:45.090> start<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> car<00:03:46.020> off<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.680> use

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
basically start the car off and not use

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.080 
basically start the car off and not use
as<00:03:47.010> much<00:03:47.160> throttle<00:03:47.520> as<00:03:47.760> you're<00:03:47.910> actually

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
as much throttle as you're actually

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.360 
as much throttle as you're actually
applying<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.020> these<00:03:49.380> cars<00:03:49.680> are<00:03:49.920> susceptible

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
applying so these cars are susceptible

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.040 
applying so these cars are susceptible
to<00:03:50.730> wheel<00:03:50.940> spin<00:03:51.330> because<00:03:51.540> they<00:03:51.720> have<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.959> much

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
to wheel spin because they have so much

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.080 
to wheel spin because they have so much
power<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.310> will<00:03:53.459> help<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.850> if<00:03:53.970> you're

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
power but that will help you if you're

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.780 
power but that will help you if you're
on<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.270> slippery<00:03:54.600> slope<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.470> not<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.280> life<00:03:56.489> book

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
on a slippery slope and not in life book

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.150 
on a slippery slope and not in life book
in<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.150> car<00:03:57.330> in<00:03:57.480> general<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.050> give<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.920> go

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
in the car in general so give that a go

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.530 
in the car in general so give that a go
if<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.370> do<00:03:59.489> get<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.760> drive<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> car<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:00.420> I'm

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
if you do get to drive the car but I'm

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
if you do get to drive the car but I'm
really<00:04:00.870> liking<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.680> minute

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
f-type is not cheap but it does deliver

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
serious focused output from Jaguar and

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.909 
serious focused output from Jaguar and
could<00:04:15.360> potentially<00:04:15.450> be<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.049> best<00:04:16.260> sports<00:04:16.530> car

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919

out<00:04:17.220> there<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.640> do<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:18.000> my<00:04:18.030> buttons<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
out there I do like my buttons on a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.720 
out there I do like my buttons on a
founder<00:04:19.290> an<00:04:19.530> interesting<00:04:20.040> one<00:04:20.130> here<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.549> can

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.610 
the spoiler or put the spoiler out so
you'll<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.890> 120<00:04:26.610> kilograms<00:04:27.080> less<00:04:28.080> lift<00:04:28.410> in

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
you'll get 120 kilograms less lift in

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.830 
you'll get 120 kilograms less lift in
the<00:04:28.740> car<00:04:28.919> so<00:04:29.430> aerodynamically<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.510> car<00:04:30.720> will

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
the car so aerodynamically the car will

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.020 
the car so aerodynamically the car will
be<00:04:30.960> better<00:04:31.169> balanced<00:04:31.740> at<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.980> higher<00:04:32.220> speed<00:04:32.250> so

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
be better balanced at a higher speed so

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.550 
be better balanced at a higher speed so
our<00:04:33.120> nice<00:04:33.270> little<00:04:33.300> buttons<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> player<00:04:34.050> or<00:04:34.500> you

our nice little buttons a player or you
could<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:34.740> press<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.070> because<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.520> car

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
could just press it because the car

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.980 
could just press it because the car
looks<00:04:35.910> better<00:04:36.120> with<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.360> bit<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.630> spoiler

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
