00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.290
 Yes military of snow stick series coming soon turn to the voice 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:15.440
 It will be an introduction, but Snow Stick series 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:19.550
 It is often said that the so-called powder board, but basically it is initially 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.619
 Tteyuu's on in Gillen surfing as brought in in the matter to make this 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.340
 The original concept 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:30.650
 One tick series is made first 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.680
 It is a bit different from how to ride a round riot 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.680
 a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:43.090
 We can operate 2 in the position of the wave riding 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:48.880
 It looks like a little bit flat on the slopes, but I also take the bots firmly in 3d and roll it 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.680
 We are also firmly Well low and medium-speed carving can kind of slip Tteyuu go slipped Te 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.730
 It is reported 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.300
 At r 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:03.940
 There are various features in the form very much, but this is also a distribution for kids, though 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.280
 But it's also completing the actual u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 and size 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.890
 It is characterized 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:15.200
 Many body axis points are right on the forefoot 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.030
 In just the such it will be one of the sides 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 The chief is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 Basically, turn to the front and form a team before the big accident 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 Stance too 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 It is better to go a little ahead 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.220
 It becomes easy to get on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.730
 This board is basically 1 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:43.370
 Make it magic and turn it forward so that you can stop juice with both feet 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.070
 I tend to think that only anti- magic four characters in a little, but if you move the axis properly with both feet 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.920
 If you do so, you can 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 If you can carve here in the parliament and guess when you go somewhere 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.390
 Sliding out the hind legs 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.460
 Oh dear 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 Became good move board to Fu say really this feeling like a forest 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.680
 Has entered 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 Here 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:14.660
 It is a series of Swallowtail Basically it is after all 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.230
 Body axis forefoot you sweet spot around here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.390
 You manipulate the ride here in there is a place to put 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.100
 Chart is 9 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.840
 Also it'd features 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.500
 I bend the board and carve it and say in the second half 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.360
 9 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:41.930
 Around a little feel and do come have it that flex is changed 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:43.140
 After or you can turn to when you slide in anticipation normally climb yourself somewhere 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.610
 this 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.540
 The last soft place 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:54.710
 When the bottom of the feeling because it slash is the best feeling good in the stick series 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.230
 It is a series that has been 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.610
 It's a feeding port, and sweet spots are a bit like here and after 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.390
 It is placed in the middle 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.060
 Rikoejji Do than the series referred to in the a little longer looks a little easy ride 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.300
 Yes 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.180
 Yes 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:19.430
 In Eee 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:20.120
 This time it will be a series of pintails and basically as a feature of pintails 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.760
 Is 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.280
 If riding the body axis I'd like very much is Te before eyes smell 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.780
 False rumor 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:37.520
 Or from the board also series say a little Yuko edge is longer, so still 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.740
 It is a series that is easy to get on even people who have not received a major accident before long ago 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.640
 After movement thereof include 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:48.590
 It has become a good not very politely shifted slide 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:54.170
 Tightly on the slope 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.819
 Carving here, bot Take another shot, and it will be very beautiful when going to the next turn 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.819
 Than to slide 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.800
 Slide large or after 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.190
 U 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:08.280
 Like cruising a muddy wave 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:14.980
 It has become to go all without Surusuru 9 caught on stage board 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:19.870
 There is a little merit demerit, but a little bit too long tail 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:27.190
 After all when we enter places such as a little rough ground or a fine touch 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:29.190
 There are times when body gets in the way if we take out bot and take it out and turn it back 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.480
 Attracting Leeds 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.820
 This body has a minute and pintail 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:41.610
 Part 9 is an amateur 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.150
 That glide smoothly without being caught also back in without being caught even such small sour 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.600
 I can do it 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:57.160
 It will be a series of performance æ¡‘ still now It is Rokumaru that I have now 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:59.980
 However, this is firm until it is great and it is hard to stay here 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.270
 I have sweet spots but 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.260
 Firmly behind 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:10.280
 Recommended for those who want to use a card 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:15.250
 I want to do rail work with high speed 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.250
 It 's highly recommended to say that you want to beat big 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:26.510
 Though it is the snow stick series that I was accustomed to now 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.460
 Well, I think the powder is fun in the footer or something like that 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:35.390
 Also it is I do not may become prone 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.969
 The slope that looks a little flat as I just explained is also 3d to read its undulations firmly 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.040
 Look up 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.880
 nao 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:46.260
 Because it is a shaven you can play by swinging left and right firmly in the white curve 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:52.569
 Well pretty crisp burns or shabashaba 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:55.749
 More fun than at the time was Zu' firm can be in further powder in the Gerinringu is 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:59.610
 Because it is such a report, everybody 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:02.960
 Please take the other party in a test ride event 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.960
 Thank you for your dividend
