I'm kind of a ding dong at this kind of

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.110 
I'm kind of a ding dong at this kind of
things<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.049> um<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.459> most<00:03:48.670> part<00:03:48.850> that's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
things but um for the most part that's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.580 
things but um for the most part that's
what<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.389> is<00:03:49.480> because<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.750> lot<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.170> girls

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
what it is because a lot of the girls

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.030 
what it is because a lot of the girls
who<00:03:51.069> follow<00:03:51.310> me<00:03:51.549> on<00:03:51.639> Facebook<00:03:52.359> um<00:03:53.139> like<00:03:53.799> the

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.170 
same things that I do or make little
comments<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.980> thing<00:03:57.190> is<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.790> can't<00:03:58.030> be

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
comments and the thing is is I can't be

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.729 
comments and the thing is is I can't be
really<00:03:58.600> quick<00:03:58.780> about<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.380> they're<00:03:59.500> always

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
really quick about it and they're always

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.210 
really quick about it and they're always
adding<00:04:00.310> new<00:04:00.340> things<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:01.239> um<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:02.530> wouldn't<00:04:03.130> be

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
adding new things so um it wouldn't be

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.879 
adding new things so um it wouldn't be
unlikely<00:04:03.819> if<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.420> had<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.660> couple<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.350> bags<00:04:05.530> in
