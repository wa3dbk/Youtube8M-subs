00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
continue to stay offshore but as it does

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640

that moisture here closer to the beaches
we<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> mix<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.900> sleet<00:01:28.110> even

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
we are going to see a mix of sleet even

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.480 
we are going to see a mix of sleet even
the<00:01:28.560> potential<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the potential for a little bit of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
freezing rain and snow at the beaches

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.499 
freezing rain and snow at the beaches
inland<00:01:32.280> areas<00:01:32.520> looking<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.939> mainly<00:01:33.450> snow

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
inland areas looking like mainly snow

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.440

with<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.200> event<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.799> does<00:01:34.979> move<00:01:35.220> by<00:01:35.820> arco

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
with this event as it does move by arco

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
with this event as it does move by arco
so<00:01:36.689> we'll<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> colder<00:01:37.439> air<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so we'll see the colder air at the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.380 
so we'll see the colder air at the
surface<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> way<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.150> into<00:01:39.329> the

atmosphere but closer to the beaches may

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.249 
atmosphere but closer to the beaches may
see<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> warmer<00:01:42.329> air<00:01:42.360> moving<00:01:43.140> in

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
see a little bit of warmer air moving in

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.330 
see a little bit of warmer air moving in
in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.500> upper<00:01:43.799> levels<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> atmosphere

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.789 
in the upper levels of the atmosphere
surface<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:45.810> cold<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.619> could

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
surface will be very cold so that could

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
surface will be very cold so that could
lead<00:01:46.950> us<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> some<00:01:47.759> sleet<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.060> freezing<00:01:48.240> rain

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
lead us to some sleet and freezing rain

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.910 
lead us to some sleet and freezing rain
mixing<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.770> why<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
mixing in with this so that's why it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
mixing in with this so that's why it's

sleet<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.869> freezing<00:02:01.049> rain<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.860> in

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
sleet and freezing rain we see in

addition to that snow we're really have

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
addition to that snow we're really have
an<00:02:04.049> effect<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.530> our<00:02:04.590> accumulation<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.670> that's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
an effect on our accumulation so that's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.160 
an effect on our accumulation so that's
something<00:02:06.180> we'll<00:02:06.299> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> keep<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> updated

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
is for those snow showers and even sleet

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.130 
is for those snow showers and even sleet
and<00:02:24.520> freezing<00:02:24.670> rain<00:02:25.000> becoming<00:02:25.510> likely<00:02:25.930> for

and freezing rain becoming likely for

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.990 
and freezing rain becoming likely for
the<00:02:26.230> afternoon<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.980> tuesday<00:02:27.310> will<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.880> that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the afternoon on tuesday will see that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.310 
the afternoon on tuesday will see that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
gradually begin to move in high

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.500 
gradually begin to move in high
temperatures<00:02:29.830> only<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.700> middle<00:02:30.970> 30s<00:02:31.330> on

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
temperatures only in the middle 30s on

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.870 
temperatures only in the middle 30s on
Tuesday<00:02:32.080> then<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.530> Tuesday<00:02:33.010> night<00:02:33.250> will<00:02:33.760> be

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
Tuesday then for Tuesday night will be

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.790 
Tuesday then for Tuesday night will be
windy<00:02:34.150> with<00:02:34.450> temperatures<00:02:34.870> down<00:02:35.110> into<00:02:35.170> the

windy with temperatures down into the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.410 
windy with temperatures down into the
20s<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.550> that'll<00:02:36.910> drop<00:02:37.060> wind<00:02:37.270> chill<00:02:37.390> values

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
20s so that'll drop wind chill values

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.960 
20s so that'll drop wind chill values
down<00:02:37.900> into<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> teens<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.800> addition<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.790> that

for Tuesday night going to see that
sleet<00:02:43.959> potential<00:02:44.410> for<00:02:44.560> freezing<00:02:44.800> rain<00:02:45.190> as

sleet potential for freezing rain as

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
sleet potential for freezing rain as
well<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:45.820> certainly<00:02:46.180> could<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.900> dealing<00:02:47.080> with

of some power outages especially as we
go<00:02:51.550> Tuesday<00:02:51.940> night<00:02:52.120> into<00:02:52.150> Wednesday<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.780> we'll

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
go Tuesday night into Wednesday so we'll

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.540 
go Tuesday night into Wednesday so we'll
certainly<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.709> keep<00:02:53.860> an<00:02:53.980> eye<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.370> as

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
certainly have to keep an eye on that as

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.340 
certainly have to keep an eye on that as
we<00:02:54.670> head<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.940> next<00:02:55.209> couple<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.510> days<00:02:55.720> then

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
we head to the next couple of days then

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.840 
we head to the next couple of days then
for<00:02:56.410> Wednesday<00:02:57.010> will<00:02:57.220> see<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.550> wintry

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
for Wednesday will see that wintry

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.520 
for Wednesday will see that wintry
precipitation<00:02:58.000> likely<00:02:58.989> at<00:02:59.140> least<00:02:59.320> for<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
precipitation likely at least for the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.080 
precipitation likely at least for the
first<00:02:59.650> half<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.130> day<00:03:00.160> notice<00:03:00.940> high

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
first half of the day notice high

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.120 
first half of the day notice high
temperatures<00:03:01.570> only<00:03:01.810> topping<00:03:02.380> out<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
temperatures only topping out at the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.740 
temperatures only topping out at the
freezing<00:03:03.550> mark<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.060> go<00:03:04.180> into<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.570> day<00:03:04.720> on

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
freezing mark as we go into the day on

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.600 
freezing mark as we go into the day on
Wednesday<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.590> impacts<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.519> I'm

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
Wednesday so impacts this is what I'm

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.310 
Wednesday so impacts this is what I'm
thinking<00:03:06.970> right<00:03:07.209> now<00:03:07.269> we'll<00:03:07.959> see<00:03:08.110> higher

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
thinking right now we'll see higher

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.170 
thinking right now we'll see higher
totals<00:03:08.769> inland<00:03:09.130> for<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.459> snow<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:09.970> we<00:03:10.090> are

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
totals inland for the snow so we are

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
totals inland for the snow so we are
going<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.420> see<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.750> good<00:03:11.230> chance<00:03:11.440> for<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.769> snow

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
going to see a good chance for that snow

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.740 
going to see a good chance for that snow
especially<00:03:12.280> away<00:03:12.910> from<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.269> beaches<00:03:13.450> but

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
especially away from the beaches but

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.240 
especially away from the beaches but
even<00:03:14.019> at<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> coast<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.650> do<00:03:14.709> think<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:15.100> see

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
even at the coast I do think we see

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.340 
even at the coast I do think we see
periods<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.850> snow<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.570> may<00:03:16.690> see<00:03:16.750> more<00:03:17.049> sleet

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
periods of snow but may see more sleet

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.500 
periods of snow but may see more sleet
and<00:03:17.380> freezing<00:03:17.590> rain<00:03:18.010> mixing<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:18.910> sleep

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and freezing rain mixing in so sleep

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.900 
and freezing rain mixing in so sleep
potential<00:03:19.989> will<00:03:20.440> be<00:03:20.560> at<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.890> coast<00:03:21.130> freezing

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
potential will be at the coast freezing

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.520 
potential will be at the coast freezing
rain<00:03:22.090> will<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.630> monitor<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.200> because

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
rain will have to monitor that because

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.259 
rain will have to monitor that because
that<00:03:23.560> could<00:03:24.220> potentially<00:03:24.340> cause<00:03:24.880> some<00:03:25.090> power

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that could potentially cause some power

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.120 
that could potentially cause some power
outages<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:26.019> Tuesday<00:03:26.470> night<00:03:26.650> into<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.100> day

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.280 
outages for Tuesday night into the day
on<00:03:27.280> Wednesday<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.600> we'll<00:03:28.630> see<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.079> cold

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
on Wednesday so we'll see that cold

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.780 
on Wednesday so we'll see that cold
