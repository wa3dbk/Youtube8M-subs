00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
today's most production rates and to be

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.420 
today's most production rates and to be
brutally<00:05:52.690> honest<00:05:53.020> I<00:05:53.200> thought<00:05:53.410> our<00:05:53.560> good

marketing<00:05:54.970> but<00:05:55.150> is<00:05:55.240> probably<00:05:55.480> not<00:05:55.810> quite

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
marketing but is probably not quite

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.140 
marketing but is probably not quite
right<00:05:56.500> but<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.860> doesn't<00:05:56.980> matter<00:05:57.280> anyway<00:05:57.670> and

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
right but it doesn't matter anyway and

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.170
