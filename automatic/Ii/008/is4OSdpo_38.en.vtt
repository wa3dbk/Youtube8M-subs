00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
breaker for me it's so such so

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.210 
breaker for me it's so such so
exhausting<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:07.930> drag<00:01:08.259> everything<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:08.979> mile

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
exhausting to drag everything that mile

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.980 
exhausting to drag everything that mile
out<00:01:09.549> here<00:01:09.820> it's<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:10.360> much<00:01:10.570> more<00:01:10.750> comfortable

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
out here it's so much more comfortable

in<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.380> vehicle<00:01:11.590> then<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:13.330> county<00:01:13.750> tent<00:01:13.990> I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
in a vehicle then this county tent I

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.109 
in a vehicle then this county tent I
think<00:01:14.350> if<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.500> had<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.649> nice<00:01:14.860> set<00:01:15.100> up<00:01:15.250> tent

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
think if you had a nice set up tent

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.170 
think if you had a nice set up tent
would<00:01:16.270> be<00:01:16.360> where<00:01:16.540> it's<00:01:16.659> at<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.640> don't<00:01:19.030> have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
would be where it's at but I don't have

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
would be where it's at but I don't have
a<00:01:19.210> nice<00:01:19.420> setup

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130

a nice setup
it<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.340> about<00:01:21.990> 6:30<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:26.350> spirits<00:01:26.799> are

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
it is about 6:30 and my spirits are
