00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.230
 by alfredo centro alfredo attention 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.230
 little friend fall 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.300
 but better sports option 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.760
 case to translate to be a historical for 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.090
 the sport for all Galician football 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.250
 here all the hopes seemed 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.940
 get blurred we are the correct minute 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.940
 four and a half 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.690
 for a lot to say and little to tell 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.280
 I think he missed the game he 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.949
 tied the game we could not be 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.930
 champions I think it would be written 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.660
 so the team has run has not played 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.750
 too well in contained many to 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.550
 strides maybe I was too nervous 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.050
 for a foul to score a goal because I know 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.119
 true that against they attacked a couple of 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.920
 twice twice three times with a lot 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.600
 danger and that took the weight of the party 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.230
 for the sporty but not with good 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.180
 meaning not with good tone 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.160
 It could not be that we will do 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.560
 from here I have to say for the great 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.260
 dislike that the team has for the great 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.110
 disgust that I still think I have 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.520
 to congratulate the World Cups because it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.700
 they have left the skin because they have been 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.190
 head all year have been persecuted 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.250
 for a great team have tried to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.930
 stabilize have made them nervous they have 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.330
 done what they could have done well 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.680
 I think it's the rules of the game and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.990
 I think I do not have much more to say to me 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.090
 understand was a shame once 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.750
 we had it to good 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.609
 at a good level the possibilities as it is 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.350
 sad and it's hard especially because 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.990
 possibly once in a lifetime 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 we could have gotten and could not be 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.119
 I think that even more questions do not 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 I could answer because I do not know what 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.390
 tell 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.020
 here 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 thank you very much 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.790
 thank you very much thank you very much men of 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 name on behalf of all 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.230
 because I have had a bad day but one 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.939
 Once it happens, they are wrong. 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.519
 very whole while some of the 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.990
 players were having a hard time 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.970
 really bad 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.560
 I feel a great sadness for 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.380
 those people on the street that I saw 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.540
 Every day Monday Tuesday 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.610
 older people those children who had a 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.010
 illusion so tremendous and that I thought 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.900
 that we could disappoint them because 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.300
 could this happen because it is no longer the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.420
 first time they pass me or what happens to 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.220
 the people and it's happened up we went to 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.410
 miss a penalty when there was not 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.710
 no time to breathe had to occur 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.710
 all and many thanks until the next 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160
 how 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.720
 churches in your life the saddest thing in 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.720
 a whole sports career
