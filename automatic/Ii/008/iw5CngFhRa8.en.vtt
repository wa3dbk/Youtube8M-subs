think<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.840> 1981<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.010> horsepower<00:01:42.460> rating<00:01:42.790> was

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909

think in 1981 the horsepower rating was
around<00:01:43.150> 450<00:01:43.840> or<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:47.350> lets<00:01:47.950> prove<00:01:48.220> one

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
around 450 or so that lets prove one

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.070 
around 450 or so that lets prove one
reason<00:01:48.820> why<00:01:48.970> they<00:01:49.150> quit<00:01:49.330> making<00:01:49.720> these<00:01:49.810> cars

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
are just too fast they couldn't sell

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.870 
are just too fast they couldn't sell
them<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.820> public<00:01:52.000> they're<00:01:52.360> unsafe
