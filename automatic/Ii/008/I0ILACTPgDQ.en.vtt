00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.740 
to the brand new caster block the it
seemed<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.369> me<00:02:00.460> like<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.760> holes<00:02:01.000> were<00:02:01.450> not<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
seemed to me like the holes were not the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.630 
seemed to me like the holes were not the
right<00:02:01.869> size<00:02:02.170> for<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.619> screw<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.310> was<00:02:03.460> quite

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
right size for the screw and I was quite

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.490 
right size for the screw and I was quite

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
frustrated so I took it out then I

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.140 
frustrated so I took it out then I
quickly<00:02:05.830> realized<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.640> they're<00:02:06.820> designed

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.759 
quickly realized that they're designed
that<00:02:07.330> way<00:02:07.540> specifically<00:02:08.170> so<00:02:08.409> that<00:02:08.560> when<00:02:08.679> you

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
that way specifically so that when you

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.230 
that way specifically so that when you
put<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.099> screw<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.520> for<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.849> first<00:02:10.090> time

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
put the screw in for the first time

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.540 
put the screw in for the first time
you're<00:02:10.990> creating<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.620> own<00:02:11.740> threads

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
you're creating your own threads

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.230 
you're creating your own threads
so<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.780> found<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:16.040> easiest<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.820> actually

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
so I found it was easiest to actually

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.120 
so I found it was easiest to actually
take<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.840> screw<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.180> lightly<00:02:20.770> punch<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.950> in

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
take the screw and lightly punch it in

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.450 
take the screw and lightly punch it in
there<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:23.090> pre<00:02:23.830> screwed<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.920> hole<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.310> there

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
there and I pre screwed a hole in there

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.670 
there and I pre screwed a hole in there
so<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.330> pre<00:02:26.660> threaded<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so I like I pre threaded this so to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.300 
so I like I pre threaded this so to
speak<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:29.120> makes<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.840> lot<00:02:30.110> easier<00:02:30.170> when<00:02:31.040> we're

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
speak it makes a lot easier when we're

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.730 
speak it makes a lot easier when we're
up<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.940> here<00:02:32.270> trying<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.810> screw<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.560> odd

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
up in here trying to screw it in at odd

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.330 
up in here trying to screw it in at odd
angles<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.730> awkward<00:02:35.620> awkward<00:02:36.620> turning<00:02:37.130> of

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
angles and awkward awkward turning of

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.420 
angles and awkward awkward turning of
the<00:02:38.140> screwdriver

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
the screwdriver

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.180 
the screwdriver
okay<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.490> I've<00:02:40.880> done<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.240> already<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.190> what

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
okay so I've done that already and what

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.520 
okay so I've done that already and what
I'll<00:02:43.280> do<00:02:43.460> now<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:43.970> gonna<00:02:44.090> keep<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.570> my<00:02:45.290> old

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'll do now I'm gonna keep this my old

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.110 
I'll do now I'm gonna keep this my old
piece<00:02:45.770> because<00:02:46.160> on<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.580> side<00:02:46.640> it's<00:02:46.970> not

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
piece because on this side it's not

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.400 
piece because on this side it's not
broken<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.570> I'm<00:02:47.720> gonna<00:02:47.870> keep<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.050> for<00:02:48.380> a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
broken so I'm gonna keep that for a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.190 
broken so I'm gonna keep that for a
spare<00:02:48.710> part<00:02:48.980> it's<00:02:49.550> not<00:02:50.270> as<00:02:50.390> good<00:02:50.570> quality<00:02:50.990> but

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
spare part it's not as good quality but

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.410 
spare part it's not as good quality but
if<00:02:51.290> I<00:02:51.410> do<00:02:51.470> break<00:02:51.800> this<00:02:52.010> one<00:02:52.220> I've<00:02:52.400> got<00:02:52.430> I've<00:02:53.180> got

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
if I do break this one I've got I've got

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.900 
if I do break this one I've got I've got
one<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.750> replace<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.470> pinch<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.070> knowing

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
one to replace it in a pinch and knowing

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.760 
one to replace it in a pinch and knowing
me<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.360> how<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.930> drive<00:02:57.260> into<00:02:57.530> curbs

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
me and how I like to drive into curbs

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.500 
me and how I like to drive into curbs
and<00:02:58.040> whatnot<00:02:58.370> it's<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.440> not<00:03:01.120> unheard<00:03:02.120> of

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and whatnot it's not it's not unheard of

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.400 
and whatnot it's not it's not unheard of
that<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.170> might<00:03:03.500> break<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:05.060> assembly<00:03:05.780> yet

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
that I might break this assembly yet

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.880 
that I might break this assembly yet
again<00:03:07.240> okay<00:03:08.240> so<00:03:08.300> here's<00:03:08.810> your<00:03:08.900> here's<00:03:09.770> your

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
again okay so here's your here's your

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.550 
again okay so here's your here's your
steering<00:03:10.580> your<00:03:11.360> steering<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:12.110> think<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
steering your steering I think it's a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.150 
steering your steering I think it's a
steering<00:03:12.950> blocker<00:03:13.420> or<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.990> don't<00:03:15.860> know<00:03:15.980> what

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
steering blocker or I don't know what

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.320 
steering blocker or I don't know what
it's<00:03:16.310> called<00:03:16.490> there<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.940> think<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.240> a

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
it's called there I think it's a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.730 
it's called there I think it's a
steering<00:03:17.720> block<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.200> goes<00:03:18.380> with<00:03:18.560> it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
steering block and that goes with it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.490 
steering block and that goes with it
that<00:03:18.800> goes<00:03:19.010> inside<00:03:19.390> your<00:03:20.390> caster<00:03:20.930> block<00:03:21.170> and

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
that goes inside your caster block and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.410 
that goes inside your caster block and
pivots<00:03:21.980> inside<00:03:22.310> there<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:22.670> what<00:03:23.000> I'm<00:03:23.090> gonna<00:03:23.180> do

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
pivots inside there so what I'm gonna do

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.080 
pivots inside there so what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:23.540> I'm<00:03:23.660> gonna<00:03:23.750> put<00:03:24.020> this<00:03:24.170> together<00:03:24.410> if<00:03:25.190> as<00:03:25.520> a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
is I'm gonna put this together if as a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.040 
is I'm gonna put this together if as a
as<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.630> as<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.380> piece<00:03:27.860> before<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:29.150> put<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.630> all<00:03:29.780> on

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
as a as a piece before I put it all on

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.920 
as a as a piece before I put it all on
to<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> truck<00:03:30.620> itself<00:03:31.300> if<00:03:32.300> you're<00:03:32.540> doing<00:03:32.780> both

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
to the truck itself if you're doing both

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.050 
to the truck itself if you're doing both
sides<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.680> recommend<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.220> only<00:03:34.280> do<00:03:34.610> one<00:03:34.820> side

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
sides I recommend you only do one side

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.060 
sides I recommend you only do one side
at<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.360> time<00:03:35.390> if<00:03:35.810> you're<00:03:36.350> new<00:03:36.530> at<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.770> like<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
at a time if you're new at this like I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.370 
at a time if you're new at this like I
am<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.670> will<00:03:38.150> be<00:03:38.330> helpful<00:03:38.630> for<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.200> look

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
am it will be helpful for you to look

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.830 
am it will be helpful for you to look
and<00:03:39.710> refer<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.880> other<00:03:41.030> side<00:03:41.330> just<00:03:41.360> when

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
and refer to the other side just when

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.180 
and refer to the other side just when
putting<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.290> together<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.860> ensure<00:03:43.160> that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
putting this together to ensure that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.350 
putting this together to ensure that
you're<00:03:43.640> putting<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:46.130> new<00:03:46.310> side<00:03:46.670> together

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
you're putting the the new side together

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.090 
you're putting the the new side together
the<00:03:47.690> right<00:03:47.840> way<00:03:47.900> that's<00:03:48.350> just<00:03:48.710> how<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:48.860> took

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
the right way that's just how you took

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.320 
the right way that's just how you took
it<00:03:49.160> apart<00:03:49.490> because<00:03:49.640> these<00:03:49.910> parts<00:03:50.210> are<00:03:50.300> a

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
it apart because these parts are a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.840 
it apart because these parts are a
little<00:03:50.510> bit<00:03:50.690> complicated<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:52.730> don't

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
little bit complicated and you don't

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.920 
little bit complicated and you don't
want<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> be<00:03:53.090> putting<00:03:53.300> it<00:03:53.420> in<00:03:53.540> an<00:03:53.600> upside<00:03:53.900> down

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
want to be putting it in an upside down

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.160 
want to be putting it in an upside down
or<00:03:54.500> anything<00:03:54.680> like<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:57.130> I'm<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.190> gonna

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
or anything like that so I'm just gonna

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.770 
or anything like that so I'm just gonna
put<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.290> screws<00:04:00.590> in<00:04:00.620> here<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.540> see<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.690> a

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
put the screws in here and see you in a

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.190 
put the screws in here and see you in a
minute<00:04:02.900> okay<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.970> next<00:04:05.120> step<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:06.170> that

minute okay so the next step now that
I've<00:04:06.440> got<00:04:06.620> my<00:04:06.770> assembly<00:04:07.220> put<00:04:07.400> together<00:04:07.550> here

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
I've got my assembly put together here

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.520 
I've got my assembly put together here
the<00:04:08.150> next<00:04:08.300> step<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.810> I'm<00:04:08.990> going<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.230> want<00:04:09.410> to

the next step is I'm going to want to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.000 
the next step is I'm going to want to
put<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:09.890> on<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.570> turnbuckle<00:04:12.470> with<00:04:12.830> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
put this on to the turnbuckle with the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.520 
put this on to the turnbuckle with the
toe<00:04:13.190> links<00:04:13.670> here<00:04:13.970> there's<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.630> hollow<00:04:14.900> ball<00:04:15.200> in

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
toe links here there's a hollow ball in

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.650 
toe links here there's a hollow ball in
there<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:16.010> that's<00:04:16.160> what<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:16.580> screw<00:04:17.450> will<00:04:17.630> go

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
there and that's what this screw will go

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.550 
there and that's what this screw will go
into<00:04:19.359> again<00:04:20.359> this<00:04:20.570> is<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.380> those

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
into again this is one of those

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.159 
into again this is one of those
situations<00:04:21.859> where<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.700> do<00:04:23.030> not<00:04:23.390> want<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.870> over

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
situations where you do not want to over

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.230 
situations where you do not want to over

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
how the ball link it still has give to

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.410 
how the ball link it still has give to
it<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:15.710> that's<00:05:15.920> what<00:05:16.070> that<00:05:16.250> hollow<00:05:16.520> ball<00:05:16.880> does

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
it and that's what that hollow ball does

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.940 
it and that's what that hollow ball does
you<00:05:17.780> can<00:05:17.960> actually<00:05:18.320> tighten<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:20.500> nut<00:05:21.500> onto

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950

you can actually tighten that nut onto
the<00:05:22.190> pole<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.530> this<00:05:24.530> screw<00:05:24.920> has<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.160> be<00:05:25.430> flush

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
the pole and this screw has to be flush

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.610 
the pole and this screw has to be flush
with<00:05:25.760> plastic<00:05:26.660> here<00:05:26.930> as<00:05:27.080> well

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
with plastic here as well

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
next step is we're going to put this

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.430 
next step is we're going to put this
assembly<00:05:41.810> into<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:44.050> fork<00:05:45.050> here<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:47.510> again<00:05:48.050> I

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
assembly into the fork here and again I

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.090 
assembly into the fork here and again I
want<00:05:48.830> to<00:05:48.920> line<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.490> up<00:05:49.550> so<00:05:50.150> that<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.420> whole<00:05:50.660> I

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
want to line that up so that the whole I

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.380 
want to line that up so that the whole I
always<00:05:52.100> look<00:05:52.280> through<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.670> hole<00:05:52.910> to<00:05:53.150> see

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
always look through the hole to see

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.620 
always look through the hole to see
light<00:05:54.200> come<00:05:54.560> through<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.890> other<00:05:55.010> side<00:05:55.630> and

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
light come through the other side and

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.680 
light come through the other side and
then<00:05:56.750> I<00:05:56.930> know<00:05:57.730> that<00:05:58.730> I<00:05:58.820> can<00:05:59.030> slide<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.420> pants

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
then I know that I can slide the pants

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:15.639 
then I know that I can slide the pants
straight<00:06:00.080> through<00:06:00.410> there

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:15.649 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.109 

there's<00:06:16.649> another<00:06:16.919> situation<00:06:17.219> where<00:06:17.849> you<00:06:17.969> want

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:18.119 
there's another situation where you want

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.269 
there's another situation where you want
to<00:06:18.449> check<00:06:19.289> on<00:06:19.469> the<00:06:19.589> other<00:06:19.709> side<00:06:20.009> and<00:06:20.159> make<00:06:20.189> sure

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
to check on the other side and make sure

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.719 
to check on the other side and make sure
you're<00:06:20.519> not<00:06:20.639> pushing<00:06:21.509> that<00:06:21.749> plastic<00:06:22.589> away<00:06:23.459> as

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
you're not pushing that plastic away as

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:33.169 
you're not pushing that plastic away as
you<00:06:24.179> as<00:06:24.679> you<00:06:25.679> tighten<00:06:25.919> this<00:06:26.219> screw<00:06:31.729> and<00:06:32.729> also

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:33.179 
you as you tighten this screw and also

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:35.299 
you as you tighten this screw and also
don't<00:06:33.479> just<00:06:33.599> make<00:06:34.019> it<00:06:34.199> snug<00:06:34.469> don't<00:06:35.039> over

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:35.309 
don't just make it snug don't over

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.219 
don't just make it snug don't over
tighten<00:06:35.489> that<00:06:35.789> because<00:06:36.119> again<00:06:36.449> you're<00:06:37.109> going

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
tighten that because again you're going

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.439 
tighten that because again you're going
to<00:06:37.349> need<00:06:37.469> this<00:06:37.619> mobility<00:06:38.219> for<00:06:38.939> your<00:06:39.149> shocks

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
to need this mobility for your shocks

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.719 
to need this mobility for your shocks
when<00:06:40.169> your<00:06:40.379> shocks<00:06:40.649> are<00:06:40.889> operating<00:06:41.429> you<00:06:41.549> need

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
when your shocks are operating you need

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.589 
when your shocks are operating you need
that<00:06:41.939> need<00:06:42.779> that<00:06:42.989> screw<00:06:43.289> to<00:06:43.439> turn<00:06:44.419> and<00:06:45.419> of

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
that need that screw to turn and of

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.359 
that need that screw to turn and of
course<00:06:45.809> the<00:06:45.959> last<00:06:46.139> step<00:06:46.439> is<00:06:46.649> to<00:06:46.860> connect<00:06:47.189> this

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:47.369 
course the last step is to connect this

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.869 
course the last step is to connect this
arm<00:06:47.699> back<00:06:48.629> on<00:06:48.929> to<00:06:49.199> here<00:06:50.129> and<00:06:50.369> don't<00:06:50.610> forget

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
arm back on to here and don't forget

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.639 
arm back on to here and don't forget
about<00:06:50.999> your<00:06:51.209> little<00:06:51.449> washer<00:06:51.959> that<00:06:52.169> came<00:06:52.409> off

00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:58.379 
in the first place put that through

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:06.079 
in the first place put that through
there<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.860> throw<00:07:02.249> the<00:07:02.399> washer<00:07:02.610> on<00:07:04.969> there<00:07:05.969> we

go so we're all complete here there's
your<00:07:09.299> screw<00:07:09.779> and<00:07:10.549> again<00:07:11.549> I<00:07:11.759> did<00:07:12.119> not<00:07:12.269> over

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:12.719
