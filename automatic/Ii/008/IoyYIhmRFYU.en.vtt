00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
like you carry anything about an IROC

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.020 
like you carry anything about an IROC
z28<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.899> was<00:01:50.170> like<00:01:50.350> oh<00:01:50.530> man<00:01:50.829> who<00:01:51.579> doesn't<00:01:51.880> care

z28 I was like oh man who doesn't care
about<00:01:52.060> an<00:01:52.329> IROC<00:01:52.630> z28<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:58.630> pretty<00:01:58.869> loaded<00:01:59.140> car

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
about an IROC z28 it's pretty loaded car

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.550 
about an IROC z28 it's pretty loaded car

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
were the first light cars that came with

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.390 
were the first light cars that came with
50<00:02:54.600> series<00:02:54.810> tires<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.470> low-profile<00:02:56.130> tires

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
50 series tires on low-profile tires

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.090 
50 series tires on low-profile tires
that<00:02:56.760> started<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.830> let's<00:02:58.830> clean<00:02:59.070> up

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
under here too so this car was

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.130 
under here too so this car was
somebody's<00:03:02.250> baby<00:03:02.490> yeah<00:03:03.060> yeah<00:03:05.870> we're<00:03:06.870> gonna<00:03:06.990> do

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
somebody's baby yeah yeah we're gonna do

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.020 
somebody's baby yeah yeah we're gonna do
with<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> cruise<00:03:07.890> control<00:03:07.920> still<00:03:08.580> works<00:03:08.790> and

if your donuts here and there yeah you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.360 
if your donuts here and there yeah you
think<00:03:15.720> it'll<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:15.959> something<00:03:16.230> we'll<00:03:16.920> see<00:03:17.160> here

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
think it'll do something we'll see here

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.690 
think it'll do something we'll see here
in<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> minute<00:03:17.550> we<00:03:18.530> will<00:03:19.530> brought<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.310> anyone

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
in a minute we will brought out anyone

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.370 
in a minute we will brought out anyone
you<00:03:20.880> know<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.330> spots<00:03:21.780> over<00:03:22.080> there

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
yeah well might we might make some more

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.280 
yeah well might we might make some more
new<00:03:31.200> ones<00:03:31.430> fog<00:03:32.430> lights<00:03:32.730> under<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.290> ground

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
new ones fog lights under it ground

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.900 
new ones fog lights under it ground
effects<00:03:34.650> no<00:03:34.890> man<00:03:35.160> they<00:03:35.280> were<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.640> they<00:03:35.790> were

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
effects no man they were just they were

effects no man they were just they were
just<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.239> right<00:03:36.420> car<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.930> know<00:03:37.050> I'm<00:03:37.140> saying

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
just the right car you know I'm saying

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.410 
just the right car you know I'm saying
they<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.590> did<00:03:37.920> off<00:03:38.070> he<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.940> did<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> really

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
they just did off he just did a really

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.970 
they just did off he just did a really
nice<00:03:39.690> job<00:03:39.750> from<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> factory<00:03:40.650> I'm<00:03:40.709> putting

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
nice job from the factory I'm putting

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
nice job from the factory I'm putting
these<00:03:41.040> things<00:03:41.220> together<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:42.200> don't<00:03:43.200> any<00:03:43.500> years

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
these things together I don't any years

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.360 
these things together I don't any years
they<00:03:43.920> build<00:03:44.190> them<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:45.980> wish<00:03:46.980> they'd<00:03:47.190> come

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
they build them but I wish they'd come

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.979 
they build them but I wish they'd come
out<00:03:47.430> with<00:03:47.700> him<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.910> guess<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> IROC<00:03:48.450> series<00:03:48.480> has

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
out with him I guess the IROC series has

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.370 
out with him I guess the IROC series has
debunk<00:03:49.380> now<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:50.280> um<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:51.660> there's<00:03:51.870> no<00:03:52.019> IROC

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
debunk now but um so there's no IROC

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.040 
debunk now but um so there's no IROC
because<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.650> was<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.800> race<00:03:53.010> series<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.550> was

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
because it was a race series it was

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.479 
because it was a race series it was
International<00:03:55.050> Race<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.230> Champions<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.980> why

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
International Race of Champions is why

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.940 
International Race of Champions is why
they<00:03:56.700> made<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.060> car<00:03:58.130> power<00:03:59.130> seat<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.739> since

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
they made the car power seat and since

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.800 
they made the car power seat and since
that<00:04:02.160> since<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.730> series<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.450> bunk<00:04:03.660> I

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that since that series is the bunk I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.860 
that since that series is the bunk I
guess<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.110> won't<00:04:04.290> be<00:04:04.380> making<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.739> new<00:04:04.890> IROC

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
guess they won't be making a new IROC

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.400 
guess they won't be making a new IROC
but<00:04:08.300> you've<00:04:09.300> had<00:04:09.480> quite<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> few<00:04:09.989> Camaros

it does folks there you go Steve's new
toy<00:05:33.840> 88<00:05:34.470> IROC<00:05:34.950> z28<00:05:35.390> well<00:05:36.390> let's<00:05:36.570> see<00:05:36.720> if<00:05:36.810> it'll

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
toy 88 IROC z28 well let's see if it'll

00:05:36.960 --> 00:06:10.950 
toy 88 IROC z28 well let's see if it'll
do<00:05:37.140> some<00:05:37.320> burnouts<00:05:38.060> all<00:05:39.060> right

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.660 

we're<00:06:11.960> thinking<00:06:12.230> that<00:06:12.290> those<00:06:12.740> really<00:06:13.250> that

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
we're thinking that those really that

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.530 
we're thinking that those really that
was<00:06:13.790> wicked<00:06:13.940> run<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.330> now<00:06:14.630> it's<00:06:14.780> cool<00:06:14.990> huh<00:06:16.540> well

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
was wicked run it now it's cool huh well

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.400 
was wicked run it now it's cool huh well
folks<00:06:17.750> here<00:06:17.990> you<00:06:18.050> go

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
folks here you go

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.160 
folks here you go
I<00:06:18.440> guess<00:06:19.370> that<00:06:19.520> I<00:06:19.550> Rock<00:06:19.850> will<00:06:20.090> do<00:06:20.270> burnouts<00:06:20.630> so

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
I guess that I Rock will do burnouts so

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:30.150
