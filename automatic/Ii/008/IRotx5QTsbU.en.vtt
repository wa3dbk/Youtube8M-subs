 hi friends me and juanjo have a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 cordial greeting thank you for following us on 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 social networks and do that with their 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 comments 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.810
 the blog keep growing in this 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.560
 opportunity let's make a little 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.380
 review of the virtual album of the cup 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.929
 america chile 2015 that just came out 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.210
 a few days ago and we're also going to talk 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.989
 on the subject of codes for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 get new cards or plates or 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.980
 figurines and be able to complete our 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 collection 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.579
 of this special edition of the championship 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.250
 continental that will gather 12 of the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.660
 Latin American selections more 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.470
 important 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.730
 on my page I have placed an article 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.210
 sharing some free codes 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.790
 that you can change these codes are 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.850
 multipurpose is to say that you can use it 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.940
 more than one person so if we 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.590
 we encourage you to share it 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.050
 It would be good for other people 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.120
 they can also increase their collection and 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.310
 that way we create a community in 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.720
 that we can all share from the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 codes that we find 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 and at the moment there are only three codes 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.900
 remember that they have barely passed has not 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.120
 past not even a week of 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.150
 launch so it's likely that with 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.610
 the passage of the days the codes follow 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.470
 appearing we will go collecting all 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 the codes that we can find and what 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.180
 let's share here on the page 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 in today's blog or juanjo 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.340
 always be attentive to the news 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.370
 we are going to update the list and 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.680
 moment we are going to make a small one 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.590
 small review of the interface of 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 some virtual cup america chile 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.600
 2015 freely available on its 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.780
 web version and also has a 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.619
 mobile version for iphone devices 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 ipad or android and there are two ways to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.560
 can register one is linking 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.560
 our facebook account or placing 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.630
 our data as email and 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.360
 a password in the case of being smaller 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.880
 of age you have to place an email 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.130
 electronic of our attorneys 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.850
 As I already have an account I'm just going 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.850
 to log in 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.780
 as we see and I have to wait 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.410
 incredibly 42 hours to return 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.210
 to have one envelope each envelope includes three 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.670
 stickers to go filling the album 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.760
 and we even have the possibility of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.580
 do exchanges is to say if we have 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.100
 a repeated chrome that usually happens what 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.230
 we can exchange that for another chrome 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.540
 that interests us the community of 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.610
 users of the virtual album of the cup 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.370
 america is so wide and so big that 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.709
 it's possible 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.140
 and make exchanges in a matter of little 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.209
 time let's do the example with a 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.549
 with one of the stickers that I have here and 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.760
 as I told them the only point against 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:25.790
 and is that we have to wait approximately 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.819
 up to three days if you have a little more 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.069
 to return to have free cards 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.890
 at the time of buying the cards the 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.010
 sheets for the physical album that is 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.069
 for the business edition and the part 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.310
 later we will be shown a code that 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.560
 we can use it this code is not 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.790
 that is to say you can only use one 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.819
 only once so we must have 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.819
 careful to share it on the internet 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.720
 well basically what we have here is 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.240
 a digital view in the version 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.320
 company in the right column we can go 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.320
 choosing countries 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.780
 I'm just with some cards 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.980
 in the lower part we will see the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.140
 chrome that we have to use in this case 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.660
 is claudio bravo the goalkeeper of the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.050
 Chilean selection and we simply have 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.900
 have to drag the chrome on the date 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.290
 indicated and ready so let's go filling 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.860
 our album of the america cup 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:38.640
 we go back to the homepage in this 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.500
 area in this cube we will be able to place 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.140
 the codes that have been shared in the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.300
 today's blog the juanjo we only have 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.819
 what to copy the code 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.090
 and when you paste, click on the 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.360
 activate button as I have already used the 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.340
 code to me the message will appear 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.139
 that this code and has been used without 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.900
 However you are going to be able to use it 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.210
 normally the first time as they 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.190
 I say I recommend that you share it with 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.370
 other people so that we can 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.740
 create one 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.720
 a kind of forum where we can all 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.210
 go sharing the multipurpose codes 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.729
 that we are going to meet in the network 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.710
 at the moment of going collecting our 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.169
 chromos we're going to win some 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.509
 awards some achievements that are going to go 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.699
 placing in this special double page 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.880
 or that you can see I have the 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.910
 first achievement unlocked album achievement 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.430
