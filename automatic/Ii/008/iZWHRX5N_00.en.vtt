00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
the helmet I think I have noticed that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.550 
the helmet I think I have noticed that
is<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.019> slight<00:03:36.410> difference<00:03:36.830> between<00:03:37.340> my<00:03:37.910> um<00:03:38.120> my

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
is a slight difference between my um my

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.990 
is a slight difference between my um my
2010<00:03:39.560> or<00:03:40.130> 2011<00:03:41.030> version<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:42.010> helmet<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.220> in

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
2010 or 2011 version of helmet and in

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.060 
2010 or 2011 version of helmet and in
this<00:03:44.180> one<00:03:44.390> is<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.110> actual<00:03:45.320> face<00:03:45.740> guard

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
this one is that the actual face guard

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.800 
this one is that the actual face guard
is<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.900> ever<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.560> slightly<00:03:48.590> longer<00:03:49.810> in

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
is it's just ever so slightly longer in

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.230 
is it's just ever so slightly longer in
in<00:03:51.470> this<00:03:51.920> region<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.430> actually<00:03:52.550> protrudes

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
in this region so it actually protrudes

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.870 
in this region so it actually protrudes
further<00:03:53.960> down<00:03:54.230> below<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.250> chin<00:03:55.460> and<00:03:55.730> as<00:03:55.850> a

further down below the chin and as a

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.670 
further down below the chin and as a
result<00:03:56.300> I'm<00:03:56.480> wearing<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.930> slightly<00:03:57.380> different
