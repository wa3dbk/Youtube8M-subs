00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.770
 apart from that the color is very cool

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.550
 apart from that they have been cool that are 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.990
 different by the eyes and the shape and 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.200
 the color that is going 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:50.920

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.710

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.500
 they return to cough and no others smell of soap 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.939

 box are white and smell like cinnamon 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.900
 apart from that they have smell 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.849
 in this case these of this one 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.829
 These are for when they want 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.310
 shield friends against some 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.310
 night session 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 how do you see this good purpose when 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.860
 you buy your stocks or they are going to 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.710
 give that they hope to receive good 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.840
 first they will give you a sticker like that with 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.840
 the hosting box 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.190
 they will give you a sticker so that you 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.670
 put it in your house, you want me, you're going to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.099
 give also two strips of 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.470
 of industrial velcro means that 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.830
 It has a very strong glue and it is good 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.920
 easy to apply just take off you calculate 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.500
 well where are you always? 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.989
 remember to put the hairs vellitos 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.960
 the plastic hard hooks put them 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.320
 always in the why 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.230
 on the side like this of cloth like of Peru 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.990
 always on the side of the gloves so that 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.060
 you can use many times in 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.610
 different gloves and link if they do 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.100
 the other way around they will not be able to exchange them 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.130
 because they are going to stay a milk do so 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.690
 the hard part of the velcro and always in 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.000
 the pores and the soft part the big ones 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.010
 can 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.500
 These are the ones I bought some time ago 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.720
 then the two strips come and I 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.340
 I had to cut now recently 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.010
 they are already giving their few with 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.620
 with a cut of the three eyes for 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.470
 that one more I calculated the paste this is 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.450
 apart from that they look very young they smell 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.340
 very cool they perform well they are thick 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.290
 and in this case those who shine 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.379
 care other than that has a function 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.540
 which is precisely they thought of 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.519
 people who do not have as much money as 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.519
 to buy some gloves in 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.160
 different brands 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.710
 and they did it so that you create your 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.410
 own gloves without needing to be 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.639
 cutting the the famous white board for 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.919
 chop and cut and then paste and put 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.289
 the gloves side they solved that 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.870
 with a backpack shape it looks very good very 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.300
 fashionable then this wind can you 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.300
 make your glove gloves from those of 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.949
 skin or builder's skin 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.580
 I do not recommend it much because they are very 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.370
 uncomfortable 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.919
 very hard then I recommend more the 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.740
 motorcyclist gloves because they bring 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.289
 protection on the knuckles are leather or 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.110
 plastic but resistant and also 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.940
 I recommend mechanic's gloves 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.630
 mechanic gloves for example in 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.930
 the car are now sanz 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.750
 same with protection here and they adjust very 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.250
 well they are very comfortable then I'll 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.860
 I recommend if you do not have enough 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.860
 money to buy this gloves 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.160
 make theirs always taking in 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.230
 account if they can get are 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.740
 let's get roughly cost like 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.410
 12 or 15 dollars the preparation but 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.150
 you may not be in your countries of 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.920
 where they are in their locality 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.340
 cost but it's a good option here in 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.870
 Mexico are approximately 200 250 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.700
 weights 500 and weight are saved because 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.210
 what fly the aragon gloves cost 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.990
 800 900 pesos then 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.990
 a good option 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.860
 I recommend them and see you later
