00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.210
 what do you think of first when dr 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.549
 hears science fiction british accent 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.410
 a bit dimensional transcendence 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.559
 yes now we come the thing already 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.559
 closer 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.810
 man that is bigger than of 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.140
 the first thing you think about is the outside 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.300
 of course the day a blue 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.500
 police officer from the 60s did 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.710
 that is an acronym and stands for 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.809
 creative three people in space what is 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.519
 actually a joke if you do not 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.690
 you want then you have the video 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.480
 probably not lost at all though 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.820
 I briefly went anyway for you the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.129
 is basically a mixture of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.960
 spaceship and time machine lays on it 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.379
 you through space and time who would have it 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.019
 thought 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.760
 Usually one day can be any shape 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.710
 where they want to disguise themselves 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.720
 in the series is now so that she 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.879
 due to a defective circuit 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.860
 stuck in the british police 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.070
 celle did not feel so well today 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.990
 camouflaged means that the shape changes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.850
 nothing here but at the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.850
 function and that I show you now 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.990
 times from six examples so can 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270
 the act, for example, is the function 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.409
 to accept a teacup you can 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.960
 Of course, for coffee use but 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.130
 Of course, the British drink tea and where 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.820
 comes from the day's teapot 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.480
 is just as big for them as it is for the outside 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.310
 750 milliliter purely because we are so 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.710
 have beautifully contrived transitions 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.420
 What do the British eat out of tea biscuits? 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.760
 the act is ex dose 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.320
 that's what it looks like and even makes 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.909
 noises when you turn them on and it 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.909
 lit up here 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.020
 a cookie jar that makes noise what 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 you want more 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.870
 good sounds and lighting 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.010
 the usb hub here in the form of a day 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.350
 can you then four usb sticks 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.690
 ventilators hard drives mini 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.410
 I still have rocket launcher aquarium 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.820
 not seen 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.950
 all these things could be done 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.490
 connect or simply make noise 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.610
 made cool looks like 2 we have 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.690
 again with the two but how 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 to be considered z 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.980
 these are the tadese salt and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.989
 Pepper shakers and last but not least 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.459
 The tag span can be made of ceramic 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.560
 nothing funny to me anymore except one 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.560
 you also need her very much if you 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.920
 had you bought all the other things 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.920
 not so good
