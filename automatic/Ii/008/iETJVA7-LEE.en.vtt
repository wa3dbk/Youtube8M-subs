00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
were backwards but normally by putting

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the left and that's correct that'll make

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
the left and that's correct that'll make
the<00:01:12.450> needle<00:01:12.780> tip<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> back<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.220> the
