some out of the corruption for a bit
less<00:01:10.290> healing<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.149> into

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
less healing and then put it into

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.929 
less healing and then put it into
madness<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> wanted<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.740> damage<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.909> I

then<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.140> actually<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.590> skill<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.130> can

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
then this actually a skill that you can

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.359 
then this actually a skill that you can
pick<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.729> pick<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.119> chain<00:01:51.749> lightning<00:01:52.219> which<00:01:53.219> is

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
pick up pick up chain lightning which is

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.310 
pick up pick up chain lightning which is
quite<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> cool<00:01:53.820> skill<00:01:54.179> allows<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:54.929> attack

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
quite a cool skill allows you to attack

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.300 
quite a cool skill allows you to attack
multiple<00:01:56.070> opponents<00:01:56.609> with<00:01:56.939> lightning<00:01:58.219> then<00:01:59.219> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
multiple opponents with lightning then I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
multiple opponents with lightning then I
don't<00:01:59.549> normally<00:01:59.670> bother<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.299> suppression

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
don't normally bother with suppression

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
at once it holds them at bay but I don't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.590 
at once it holds them at bay but I don't
bother<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.100> much<00:02:11.280> pick<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.120> lightning

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
could take a few points off lightning or

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.890 
could take a few points off lightning or
corruption<00:03:44.310> depending<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.300> what<00:03:45.420> skills<00:03:45.720> you

more<00:03:48.030> damage<00:03:48.600> what<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> would<00:03:49.740> do<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.100> is

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
more damage what I would do this is

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.770 
more damage what I would do this is
level<00:03:50.610> fifty<00:03:50.940> build<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.450> what<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.660> would

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
level fifty build but what I would

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.430 
level fifty build but what I would
actually<00:03:52.290> do<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:53.360> maybe<00:03:54.360> take<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.930> few<00:03:55.080> off

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
actually do is maybe take a few off

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.540 
actually do is maybe take a few off
lightning<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.700> few<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.090> corruption<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
lightning and a few of corruption and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.720 
lightning and a few of corruption and
pick<00:03:59.550> up<00:03:59.760> calcify<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.680> stick<00:04:02.010> three<00:04:02.310> points

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.970 
pick up calcify and stick three points
on<00:04:02.880> there<00:04:03.120> because<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.630> would<00:04:03.810> increase<00:04:04.710> the

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
on there because that would increase the

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.430 
on there because that would increase the
damage<00:04:05.250> dealt<00:04:05.970> by<00:04:06.090> your<00:04:06.390> force<00:04:06.660> lightning<00:04:06.960> but
