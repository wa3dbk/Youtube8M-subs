 this to you then the first 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.789
 The book I have here is an eye in the eye. 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.890
 by both these authors dtn rands and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.869
 the bank lives this is the first volume of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.090
 a trilogy of the same name if I do not 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 The second trilogy book mistake has already been 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 published and called tooth for tooth is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.530
 a trilogy about revenge is obviously 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.149
 the title has already delivered this and the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 main characters are the three 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 girls here on the cover it is narrated in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.239
 first person being with the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.579
 alternating chapters level for 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.739
 girl, the chapters are short and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 each chapter will have a name of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.030
 one of the girls who will grab this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.949
 chapter at some point the story 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 of these three mines will cross 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.579
 they are not friends from the beginning you 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.699
 has known throughout history and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 involve revenge to do this revenge 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.960
 avenge the three lines is very interesting 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.909
 being that contrary to what imagined 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 before reading the book revenge is not 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.680
 nothing magic do not expect a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.500
 revenge type vivendi know something 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.540
 inside the same adolescent target audience 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 I think of this book as a little 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.450
 younger then I really liked it 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.580
 of this book I found three stars of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 Five I do not know but I will leave the link 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.470
 teacher's full review remembered it hurts 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.170
 for you down here and so I 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.930
 I loved writing a lot of them involving the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 which I liked a lot but it 's one thing 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 quiet province on those days which 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.570
 you do not have anything else to do 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.790
 although rabbit is very interesting 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.460
 well worth checking 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.549
 the next book the glass boy book 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 already changes complete and 27 thematic this is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.920
 a super intense book in some 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.320
 people consider it a subcategory 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.780
 called cycle chic is like a literature 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.960
 which involves sicker and more 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.820
 heavy for young people and that this 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.420
 will address on the subject of anorexia 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.850
 bulimia at last problems no disturbances 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.470
 food and will narrate at first 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.980
 person the life of this girl that I 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.709
 I forgot the name now and the writing 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.500
 it is very different because it makes 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.380
 that you enter inside the head of the line 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.290
 exactly as she thinks it would be 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.040
 weak patient knows disturbed has many 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.330
 mental problems and finally you feel 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.520
 That's when I read this book. 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.290
 very shaken because at the end of the book 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.600
 put it on her head. 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.459
 all I had was what she felt and 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.610
 I think that's pretty valid 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.830
 despite having suffered in the beginning to 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.540
 to enter is to like it leaves like this 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.060
 writing was different from what was 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.770
 accustomed but I do not think I remember 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.600
 How many stars I gave him but I'm going 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.520
 leaving the link below gives an example 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 you are probably the top note that 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.440
 other best-selling books that are 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.450
 four stars out of five and that's what I think 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.580
 that the name of the author is spoken before 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.700
 love rock where they are highly recommended 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.370
 free from influence I have that 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.320
 place to home side of the few stefhany 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.610
 You've heard a lot about whether the book 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.850
 which I recommend was one of the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.890
 best readings of the year 2013 that he 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.709
 will follow the story of squid that is 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.510
 A pretty crazy girl is her dream. 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.790
 she is a costume designer who 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.070
 clothes and every day she has a wardrobe 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.459
 different then she wears wigs she is 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.269
 very amusing so that she suffers 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.070
 with a shadow of the past of her life is 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.500
 a neighbor who had moved in two 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.450
 years ago and apparently civil returned 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.720
 when her life she had great tava 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.900
 boyfriend the musician and super cattle type 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.600
 I liked her older her parents did not 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.220
 They liked her boyfriend because of the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.730
 but I think these habitats 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.459
 It made everything cooler, but then it comes. 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.060
 this neighbor is there to disturb the plot without 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.549
 people 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.440
 nothing too obvious is the plot of the 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.780
 start to end is really a focal point 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.420
 strong point is not the plot but it is written 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.100
 her and the characters are well 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.350
 built so you get involved with 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.110
 two characters you engage involve 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.739
 well with 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.260
 romance novel my ball pretty did 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.230
 well in remembering the time in centuries 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.140
 spent in is very fun because there the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.290
 reading the best of 2013 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.810
 then the first book in the series is e 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.540
 louriga home of house is part of a 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.800
 series that are calling around in Ana 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.260
 blond and iso 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.390
 the first volume of the series is Ana and a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.480
 French kiss and the third volume goes 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.300
 leaving in 2014 I think and will call Islam 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.419
 and the happily ever after and it's a series 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.400
 not because of the story that has not 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.350
 continue until you can pick up and read 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.610
 any book you want on the hour in 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.550
 you want because they are 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.950
 complete stories plus the characters 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.570
 are jumping from story to story and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.250
 both French people accompany 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.070
 history of ana index exchange in 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.580
 France and finally of the French passion 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.430
 rolled in france is this I found a little 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.860
 strongest of the owner but is his first 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.350
 author of the book is written so and not 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.810
 was so strong despite the fact that 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.180
 liked the same way of law and had 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.490
 some points I think she failed 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.610
 but very little of the same note the two 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.900
 books also frame of 52 ground blog 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.910
 all members of the family who have 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.070
 blog income and I 'm going to face everyone here 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.520
 low and then you get there to the tip 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.250
 you in the super cool legal series 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.290
 finally the last book that I speak 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.590
 This review of my book is going to be the book. 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.380
 shatter me taer maf he is also the 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.360
 first volume of a trilogy already has the 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.550
 second volume here in Brazil that a 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.990
 also the third of the states saga 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.710
 united now think in brazil yet 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.600
 there are none going out and writing 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.430
 it is very similar to the writing of 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.470
 very similar glass girls too 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.360
 this proposal if you get in the head 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.640
 from the character to the character is also a 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.590
 person who has mental problems so 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.360
 I was very similar and I also had 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.430
 difficulties I have already seen that this type of 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.460
 language I still have to have bigger 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.220
 intimacy but it's very interesting is 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.490
 see a different proposal for and it goes 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.979
 count is a dystopia so right me 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.420
 Sorry the world ended there I have 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.900
 dictatorship is not in government 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.990
 this dictatorship keeps the company 264 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.940
 I'm not mistaken because she used to be able to 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.180
 weird decorating touches people 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.540
 bad things happen dead things 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.510
 happen until one day she after 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.350
 of 224 days imprisoned without any contact with 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.690
 the humanity 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.730
 send another prisoner part of her and 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.400
 she recognizes a prisoner who was the 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.550
 passion of her childhood , yes, when she 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.950
 The child is there and she did not know 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:03.320
 know her but there is that thing that comes up 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:06.170
 but it's not an obvious question 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.450
 so will a love triangle roll with 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.290
 the villain of the story as scary 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.900
 that this seems to be it, she is the 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.810
 history of all the dystopia of the 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.150
 escape from it to try not to be dominated 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.920
 by the government and try to change the 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.390
 Tokyo 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.170
 so that's it folks these were the blacks 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.720
 For example, I think I gave too. 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.810
 three inspire 15 I did not like it so much 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.460
 so silly but it's something that 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.890
 I found it very cool that we spend it 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.840
 it reminded me many apps mind me 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.820
 I really like jackman and it's okay. 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.070
 It's really alright, I'll do it 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.600
 continue tutóia technologies will be the 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.810
 The way I have here I intend 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:52.370
 continue this people
