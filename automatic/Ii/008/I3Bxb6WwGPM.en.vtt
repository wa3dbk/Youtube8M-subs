00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
cutting both at the same time what

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
cutting both at the same time what
you're<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.540> you're<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890 
you're going to do is you're going to
cut<00:02:13.410> one<00:02:13.590> side<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.910> works<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.569> always

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
cut one side see that works it's always

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
cut one side see that works it's always
good<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.110> cut<00:02:16.470> shorter<00:02:17.040> than<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.640> want

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.720 
good to cut shorter than what you want
because<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.930> can't<00:02:19.200> put<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> fabric<00:02:20.190> back<00:02:20.549> on

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
because you can't put the fabric back on

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910 
because you can't put the fabric back on
but<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.090> can<00:02:21.239> cut<00:02:21.450> down<00:02:21.480> further<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.709> want

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
but you can cut down further if you want

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.569 
but you can cut down further if you want
to<00:02:23.010> make<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.730> longer<00:02:24.110> anyways<00:02:25.110> after<00:02:25.860> you're

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
to make it longer anyways after you're

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:34.490 
to make it longer anyways after you're
going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> fold<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.810> half<00:02:28.730> like<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
going to fold it in half like so and you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.789 
going to fold it in half like so and you

the way down to where you cut it on the
other<00:02:40.950> side

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.449

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
there you have it do you have your

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.490 
there you have it do you have your
t-shirt<00:02:55.250> ready<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.420> go<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.019> let's<00:02:57.200> try<00:02:57.439> it

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
t-shirt ready to go so let's try it

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.740 
t-shirt ready to go so let's try it
after<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.340> cut<00:02:58.579> everything<00:02:58.849> out<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.569> try

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
after you cut everything out and you try

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.170 
after you cut everything out and you try
to<00:02:59.780> run<00:02:59.959> see<00:03:00.319> how<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.620> sides<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.909> doesn't

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
to run see how the sides it doesn't

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.369 
to run see how the sides it doesn't
matter<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.659> don't<00:03:02.810> cut<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.109> properly

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
matter if you don't cut it properly

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.800 
matter if you don't cut it properly
because<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:03.890> curls<00:03:04.189> in<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:05.090> this<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.450> what<00:03:05.719> it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
because just curls in so this is what it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.990 
because just curls in so this is what it
looks<00:03:05.989> on<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.170> side<00:03:06.469> and<00:03:06.829> it's<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.609> of<00:03:07.760> like

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
looks on the side and it's kind of like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.050 
looks on the side and it's kind of like
a<00:03:08.060> little<00:03:08.689> bit<00:03:08.870> not<00:03:09.489> like<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.609> want<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.819> little

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
a little bit not like I want a little

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.330 
a little bit not like I want a little
bit<00:03:11.180> lower<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:11.659> I'm<00:03:12.319> going<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:12.950> take<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.129> off

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
bit lower so I'm going to take it off

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.160 
bit lower so I'm going to take it off
and<00:03:13.549> do<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:13.939> again<00:03:14.000> we're<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:14.599> going<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.900> cut

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
and do it again we're just going to cut

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.709 
and do it again we're just going to cut
it<00:03:15.290> down<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.920> bit<00:03:16.159> further<00:03:16.489> like<00:03:16.879> maybe

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:17.719 
it down a little bit further like maybe

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.199

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
it's two inches down and then curl it

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:32.890 
it's two inches down and then curl it
outwards<00:03:23.989> again

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.050 

and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:34.549> China<00:03:35.439> so<00:03:36.439> after<00:03:36.890> we<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.340> adjusted

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060
