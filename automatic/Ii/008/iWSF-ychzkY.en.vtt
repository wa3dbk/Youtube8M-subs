00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.310
 products that I use in the morning then in the morning to clean the face use 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.740

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.670
 practically the tram line entirely dedicated to the cleaning of the face you do 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.699
 the excellent products 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.730
 rights in particular is a pharmaceutical brand so you will find it in 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 almost all pharmacies 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.589
 and then very expensive 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.599
 and it is also an excellent test for sensitive and intolerant skin. 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.499
 ikea milano 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.589
 and 2 in 1 detergent indicated for the face and eyes 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.519
 so by buying a single product you will have the opportunity to 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.000
 have 2 in one 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.640
 and has a cost of around 14 euros the 200 ml tube is six months after opening 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.340
 however this evening on TV it is not so effective that it is really enough 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.230
 a small part 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.440
 and so a tube making videos there was a lot I don't know if from the camera 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.830
 can you see it 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 table of my tube practically m bar code height if you don't come 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.340
 all all every day from 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.869
 city ​​of excellence now therefore anyway 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.070
 it is a well done expense 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 I want to see the consistency again 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.180
 penis tea and superfluid cleansing milk 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.290
 and it's great for those who can norris 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.250
 rinse 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.300
 so actually I used it quietly on the lemon face 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.600
 of excess with a discreet cotton pad 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.810
 to remove make-up you have automatically cleaned and hydrated it below 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.420
 why 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.750
 sometimes it's just the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.580
 late tap water that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.210
 it tends to wait for the skin when it is very rich in chestnuts when it is used 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.180
 earth remove any lists too much that you do not leave 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.439
 buying cleansing milk is thermal water 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.130
 I had this one from the band artist buy sempri pharmacy pro 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.679
 on the market there are many different parts of the thermal waters you betray 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.449
 if I'm not mistaken ravenna the panther - I would not be wrong 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.669
 but I am very faithful, this one of the use apple I think from about 10 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.349
 years 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.529
 so really welcoming and excellent 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.700
 like the thermal water I also use it as a tonic so after having cleaned well 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:33.329
 the face then after removing any residual impurities from 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.219
 makeup remover 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.059
 scrubs had a nice dose of thermal water, I let it dry out here 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.360
 care 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.059
 area without removing it 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.569
 this here that by spray 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.609
 a canister 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.549
 panmedia contains about 150 ml of product 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.990
 however this one has a cost of around 7 euros but for 10 euros you can 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.360
 but this is the pharmacy you can hear the large cylinder about 250 or 300 ml 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.799
 I don't remember exactly 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.840
 and how much it costs about 10 50 years so if you want for the house 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.900
 it is very convenient however this smaller package can also carry the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.069
 trip to the gym ardor volley team placed for you anyway 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.860
 it is really convenient even in summer to cool off you can put it on 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.700
 fridge 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.950
 It is an excellent remedy for bags against dark circles 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.130
 it is a product I should always have at home 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.579
 it is also very useful on burns 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.939
 or for example if the pd tennis and biscuits when you go to the sea because 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.960
 you have not seen the sunscreen 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.770
 therefore it is a very useful product and also redundant products also indicated for i 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.529
 children 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.889
 so you really love me a passepartout 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.989
 this is as far as facial cleansing is concerned now let us look at the cassation 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.819

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.099

 art is a specific cream for mystery skins 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.090
 and to the sun protection factor 15 girls I recommend the factor of 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.169
 protection is very important 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.139
 in particular the crack one cost here is so expensive if I'm not mistaken around 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.419
 for 20 euros 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.050
 is a 50 ml bottle 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.130
 it's something that to you is really the kind of bottle because a 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.809
 verrayes bottle 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.489
 here you can see at this dispenser 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.550
 and I can guarantee that a single dose of product is sufficient for the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.940
 customer is resurrected 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.840
 so it's really good as a cream 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.059
 and I love it because it is moisturizing but at the same time name 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.169

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.510
 barely noticeable 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.390
 and it is absorbed immediately and fantastic if it is not an excellent base for make-up leaves 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.310
 the skin has come 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.659
 harp is really good pie 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.650
 and night of course I didn't cause any problems with it 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.320
 irritation to the sea ancona sebum-regulating function here mothers do not need me 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.089
 then apply for further yes 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.879

 use a specific cream for the eye contour at 24 and can be used 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.000
 geekissimo youtube 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.110
 this is è based on extracts of blue alga always from Sunday daniele 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.360
 Biacchessi 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.439
 now beyond what in active principle however I find myself very well with 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.919
 me as a cream 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.460
 the crazy delirious high quality you can always see of these here est that 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.180
 in my opinion 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.080
 they are more hygienic than the tubes 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.449
 and respect arl 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.520
 the patients because of the overweight already the fingers already augmented 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.130
 however if it is not the attention to close immediately to the touch however 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.830
 enter the inside of the product 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.700
 same thing for the tube because moments when you press cristina del 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.810
 low it extends air from outside so I find them little xd 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.939
 you say these here are designed specifically for this 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:25.009
 to access also like this here 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.419

 last baronissi then use quietly for some time 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:45.250
 eeeee this here iam costs around 23 24 euros 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.190
 then it depends because some pharmacies also apply an English discount 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.430
 italian pharmacy trust area I can get a 10% discount so it's 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.710
 important also never passes to rely on 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.250
 a single pharmacy to establish a relationship of trust. try to get any 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.629
 little discount 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.139
 itermar produced this precisely here and the deficient eye area 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.039
 as you can see 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.220
 it is slightly azzolino 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.280
 and has a consistency halfway between a thermogenic cream 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.920
 el very good in my opinion because it hydrates a lot but not at the same time 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:21.430
 is 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.430
 too creamy so it is absorbed immediately and is an excellent base 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:27.710
 for make up these here 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.970
 the products I use for the morning 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.899
