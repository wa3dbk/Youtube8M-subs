00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to be sway with the gun so it's going to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539 
to be sway with the gun so it's going to
be<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.270> harder<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:37.470> snipers<00:01:37.920> to

shoot and that there is going to be a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940 
shoot and that there is going to be a
reflection<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.780> scope<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.680> can't
