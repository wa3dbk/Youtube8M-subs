00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
something that I built with a friend of

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.589 
something that I built with a friend of
mine<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.830> slot<00:00:08.250> machine<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:09.179> how<00:00:09.420> this

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
mine this is a slot machine so how this

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.629 
mine this is a slot machine so how this
works<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.139> there's<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> one<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.309> three<00:00:11.400> chance

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
works is there's a one in three chance

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.990 
works is there's a one in three chance
that<00:00:12.570> you'll<00:00:13.259> either<00:00:13.469> win<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> jackpot<00:00:14.160> when

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
that you'll either win the jackpot when

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.779 
that you'll either win the jackpot when
something<00:00:15.690> small<00:00:16.049> or<00:00:16.289> win<00:00:16.560> nothing<00:00:16.920> at<00:00:17.039> all<00:00:17.160> so

let's take a look at the overview so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.630 
let's take a look at the overview so
basically<00:00:21.029> when<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.390> approach<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.750> there<00:00:22.170> are

basically when you approach it there are
three<00:00:23.640> options<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.199> display

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
switch the lever on and off without

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
switch the lever on and off without
paying<00:00:30.990> nothing<00:00:31.439> happens<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.189> doesn't

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
paying nothing happens it doesn't

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.060 
paying nothing happens it doesn't
shuffle<00:00:32.820> through<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:34.290> how<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.559> pay<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.040> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
shuffle through but how you pay as you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.729 
shuffle through but how you pay as you
go<00:00:35.219> over<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> slot<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.469> you<00:00:37.469> take<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
go over to the slot here and you take a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.150 
go over to the slot here and you take a
minecart<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
minecart and you put it in like that and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.459 
minecart and you put it in like that and
once<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.250> happens<00:00:44.660> you're<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.110> flip

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
once that happens you're going to flip

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.440 
once that happens you're going to flip
the<00:00:46.620> switch

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.340 

and<00:00:55.830> you<00:00:56.830> will<00:00:57.040> either<00:00:57.310> win<00:00:57.700> gold<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.570> lapis<00:00:59.140> or

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
happens or anything I'm thinking about

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.480

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
could you also have a 50-50 chance of

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.250 
could you also have a 50-50 chance of
getting<00:02:11.080> either<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.770> or<00:02:11.800> piece<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.430> lapis<00:02:13.260> so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
getting either that or piece of lapis so

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.380 
getting either that or piece of lapis so
now<00:02:14.500> let's<00:02:14.740> take<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> look<00:02:15.100> at<00:02:15.370> how<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.120> thing

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
now let's take a look at how this thing

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.100 
now let's take a look at how this thing
works<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.590> basically<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.540> simple<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
works so basically I have a simple and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.449 
works so basically I have a simple and
gate<00:02:20.380> system<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.489> detects<00:02:21.850> payment<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:22.570> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
gate system that detects payment so the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.300 
gate system that detects payment so the
turning<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.640> lever<00:02:24.880> will<00:02:25.090> only<00:02:25.270> work<00:02:25.600> if

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
turning that lever will only work if

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.410 
turning that lever will only work if
both<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.760> cart<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.810> detected<00:02:29.940> over<00:02:30.940> here<00:02:31.300> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
both the cart is detected over here and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.540 
both the cart is detected over here and
the<00:02:34.420> lever<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.810> pressed<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.250> can't<00:02:36.489> just

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
the lever is pressed so you can't just

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.100 
the lever is pressed so you can't just
press<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> lever<00:02:37.120> without<00:02:37.450> actually<00:02:37.840> pain

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
press the lever without actually pain

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.330 
press the lever without actually pain
and<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> machine<00:02:39.970> work<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.680> now<00:02:42.160> let's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and have the machine work so now let's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.470 
and have the machine work so now let's
look<00:02:42.430> at<00:02:42.580> what<00:02:42.700> happens<00:02:42.730> when<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.150> press<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
look at what happens when you press the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.370 
look at what happens when you press the
lever<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.459> basically<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.570> starts<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:47.050> clock

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
lever so basically it starts this clock

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.650 
lever so basically it starts this clock
up<00:02:47.560> here<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:49.330> starts<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.110> sequence<00:02:50.920> of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
up here and it starts a sequence of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.130 
up here and it starts a sequence of
Pistons<00:02:52.660> going<00:02:53.650> randomly<00:02:54.190> over<00:02:54.880> here<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
Pistons going randomly over here and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.020 
Pistons going randomly over here and
that's<00:02:56.350> how<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.709> shuffling<00:02:57.519> works<00:02:57.760> is

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
that's how the shuffling works is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.060 
that's how the shuffling works is
basically<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:58.720> have<00:02:59.049> clocks<00:02:59.769> on

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
basically you just have clocks on

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.870 
basically you just have clocks on
different<00:03:00.670> delay<00:03:01.360> settings<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:02.380> um<00:03:02.680> go<00:03:03.519> and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
different delay settings that um go and

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.930 
different delay settings that um go and
trigger<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:05.340> Pistons<00:03:06.340> at<00:03:06.459> different<00:03:06.730> times

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
trigger the Pistons at different times

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.960 
trigger the Pistons at different times
and<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.269> causes<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.840> shuffling<00:03:08.260> effect<00:03:08.970> so

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
and that causes a shuffling effect so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.850 
and that causes a shuffling effect so
here's<00:03:10.209> what<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.570> machine<00:03:11.079> looks<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.470> as<00:03:11.650> an

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
here's what the machine looks like as an

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.610 
here's what the machine looks like as an
overview<00:03:12.989> basically<00:03:13.989> when<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.170> press<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
overview basically when you press the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.810 
overview basically when you press the
lever<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.970> starts<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.870> clock<00:03:17.170> which<00:03:17.760> sends<00:03:18.760> a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
lever it starts a clock which sends a

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.990 
lever it starts a clock which sends a
timer<00:03:19.120> down<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.890> basically<00:03:21.310> tells<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
timer down here that basically tells the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.060 
timer down here that basically tells the
Pistons<00:03:22.329> how<00:03:22.450> long<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.810> shuffle<00:03:23.019> for<00:03:23.350> once

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
Pistons how long to shuffle for once

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.940 
Pistons how long to shuffle for once
that<00:03:24.310> happens<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.970> turns<00:03:25.420> off<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.989> clock<00:03:26.620> which

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
that happens it turns off a clock which

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.949 
that happens it turns off a clock which
will<00:03:27.400> which<00:03:28.030> stops<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.450> Pistons<00:03:28.840> from

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
will which stops the Pistons from

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.020 
will which stops the Pistons from
shuffling<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.650> what<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.400> does<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.760> goes

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
shuffling and what it does is it goes

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.449 
shuffling and what it does is it goes
over<00:03:31.180> here<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:32.200> tells<00:03:32.410> these<00:03:32.829> random

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
over here and it tells these random

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.240 
over here and it tells these random
number<00:03:33.760> generators<00:03:34.269> what<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.810> do<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.650> after

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
number generators what to do so after

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.310 
number generators what to do so after
the<00:03:36.579> timer<00:03:36.790> expires<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.600> sends<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.930> signal<00:03:38.110> to

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
the timer expires it sends a signal to

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.640 
the timer expires it sends a signal to
each<00:03:38.530> one<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.799> these<00:03:38.950> things<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
each one of these things and in the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.440 
each one of these things and in the
dispensers<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:41.860> have<00:03:42.010> some<00:03:42.310> blocks<00:03:42.640> some

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
dispensers we have some blocks some

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.449 
dispensers we have some blocks some
arrows<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:43.989> blocks<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.130> when<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
arrows and blocks and so when the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.460 
arrows and blocks and so when the
dispenser<00:03:46.150> gets<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.510> signal<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:47.049> will<00:03:47.110> have<00:03:47.440> a

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
dispenser gets a signal it will have a

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.740 
dispenser gets a signal it will have a
50-50<00:03:48.130> chance<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.610> shooting<00:03:48.790> out<00:03:49.060> either<00:03:49.420> an

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
50-50 chance of shooting out either an

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750 
50-50 chance of shooting out either an
arrow<00:03:49.989> or<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> block<00:03:50.560> if<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:51.280> should<00:03:51.430> set<00:03:51.640> an

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
arrow or a block if it should set an

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.860 
arrow nothing happens and there's no
output<00:03:53.769> but<00:03:54.310> if<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.519> shoots<00:03:54.669> out<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.880> block<00:03:55.180> it

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
output but if it shoots out a block it

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.960 
output but if it shoots out a block it
comes<00:03:56.109> down<00:03:56.320> here<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.769> triggers<00:03:57.130> this

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
comes down here and triggers this

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.480 
comes down here and triggers this
which<00:03:58.060> goes<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.570> an<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.960> gate<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.530> if<00:04:00.160> both

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
which goes to an and gate that if both

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.700 
which goes to an and gate that if both
of<00:04:00.790> these<00:04:00.910> cells<00:04:01.300> are<00:04:01.540> activated<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:02.530> and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
of these cells are activated the and

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.830 
of these cells are activated the and
gate<00:04:02.920> gives<00:04:03.220> out<00:04:03.370> an<00:04:03.490> output<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.660> will

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
gate gives out an output and that will

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.960 
gate gives out an output and that will
determine<00:04:05.200> which<00:04:05.590> prize<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.130> get<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:06.760> with

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
determine which prize you get so with

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.600 
determine which prize you get so with
these<00:04:07.120> four<00:04:07.620> random<00:04:08.620> number<00:04:09.130> generators<00:04:09.580> that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
these four random number generators that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.700 
these four random number generators that
make<00:04:09.970> up<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.330> random<00:04:10.570> number<00:04:10.990> generator<00:04:11.380> cells

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
make up to random number generator cells

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.930 
make up to random number generator cells
you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.730> have<00:04:13.090> four<00:04:14.020> outcomes<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.940> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
you can have four outcomes and the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.360 
you can have four outcomes and the
jackpot<00:04:16.420> is<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> highest<00:04:17.079> probability<00:04:17.680> of

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
jackpot is the highest probability of

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.910 
jackpot is the highest probability of
outcome<00:04:19.180> or<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> lowest<00:04:20.290> probability<00:04:20.410> of

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
outcome or is the lowest probability of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.250 
outcome or is the lowest probability of
outcome<00:04:21.250> due<00:04:21.730> to<00:04:21.940> these<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.630> gates<00:04:22.990> here

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
outcome due to these and gates here

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.170 
outcome due to these and gates here
which<00:04:23.470> selectively<00:04:23.980> choose<00:04:24.340> what<00:04:24.730> outcome

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
which selectively choose what outcome

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.020 
which selectively choose what outcome
you'll<00:04:25.420> get<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:27.160> that's<00:04:27.370> basically<00:04:27.580> how<00:04:27.910> it

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
you'll get so that's basically how it

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.960 
you'll get so that's basically how it
works<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.920> will<00:04:29.920> think<00:04:30.370> about<00:04:30.430> putting<00:04:30.700> in<00:04:30.910> a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
works I will think about putting in a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.360 
works I will think about putting in a
download<00:04:31.360> link<00:04:31.390> for<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.080> can<00:04:32.410> try<00:04:33.310> it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
download link for this so you can try it

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.910 
download link for this so you can try it
out<00:04:33.460> for<00:04:33.580> yourself<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.750> another<00:04:35.440> thing<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:35.800> was

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
out for yourself and another thing I was

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.830 
out for yourself and another thing I was
thinking<00:04:35.950> about<00:04:36.310> adding<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:37.210> addition<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
thinking about adding in addition to the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.550 
thinking about adding in addition to the
losing<00:04:38.380> sound<00:04:38.800> was<00:04:39.490> having<00:04:40.450> these<00:04:40.900> dispensers

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
losing sound was having these dispensers

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.680 
losing sound was having these dispensers
all<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.250> way<00:04:42.370> back<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.850> then<00:04:42.970> having<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.450> river

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
all the way back and then having a river

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.350 
all the way back and then having a river
of<00:04:44.190> water<00:04:45.190> go<00:04:45.550> through<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.000> someone

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
of water go through so that someone

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.940 
of water go through so that someone
can't<00:04:46.720> just<00:04:46.930> come<00:04:47.110> up<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:47.380> take<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.590> stuff

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
can't just come up and take the stuff

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.159 
can't just come up and take the stuff
but<00:04:48.760> again<00:04:48.970> if<00:04:49.090> this<00:04:49.270> was<00:04:49.450> on<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.630> server<00:04:49.930> you

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
but again if this was on a server you

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.280 
but again if this was on a server you
could<00:04:50.320> have<00:04:50.470> permission<00:04:51.419> you<00:04:52.419> could<00:04:52.570> set

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
could have permission you could set

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.110 
could have permission you could set
permissions<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:54.070> that<00:04:54.220> people<00:04:54.580> couldn't<00:04:54.790> just

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
permissions so that people couldn't just

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.300 
permissions so that people couldn't just
open<00:04:55.870> up<00:04:55.930> dispensers<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:57.600> you've<00:04:58.600> placed

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
open up dispensers that you've placed

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.550 
open up dispensers that you've placed
but<00:05:00.310> yeah<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.120> if<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.390> wasn't<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.840> server<00:05:02.410> that

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
but yeah so if this wasn't a server that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.320 
but yeah so if this wasn't a server that
didn't<00:05:02.890> have<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.250> you<00:05:03.760> might<00:05:03.940> want<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.240> have

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
didn't have that you might want to have

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.940 
didn't have that you might want to have
these<00:05:04.510> dispensers<00:05:05.050> way<00:05:05.260> back<00:05:05.500> or<00:05:05.770> in<00:05:05.890> a

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
these dispensers way back or in a

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.650 
these dispensers way back or in a
different<00:05:06.310> place<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.760> then<00:05:07.240> they<00:05:07.510> would

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
different place and then they would

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.090 
different place and then they would
dispense<00:05:08.020> something<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.710> would<00:05:08.830> travel

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
dispense something that would travel

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.730 
dispense something that would travel
down<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.520> river<00:05:09.730> of<00:05:09.880> water<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.740> therefore

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
down a river of water and therefore

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.469 
down a river of water and therefore
someone<00:05:12.220> couldn't<00:05:12.460> just<00:05:12.640> reach<00:05:12.790> in<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.210> get

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
someone couldn't just reach in and get

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.780 
someone couldn't just reach in and get
them<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:14.260> basically<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.430> for<00:05:15.669> the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
them so basically that is it for the

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.060 
them so basically that is it for the
slot<00:05:16.120> machine<00:05:16.500> while<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.620> cameras<00:05:17.919> were<00:05:18.040> off

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
slot machine while the cameras were off

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.800 
slot machine while the cameras were off
I<00:05:18.310> added<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.729> little<00:05:18.790> aesthetic<00:05:19.450> here<00:05:19.630> the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
I added this little aesthetic here the

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
I added this little aesthetic here the
win<00:05:20.110> big<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:21.300> so<00:05:22.300> that's<00:05:22.540> basically<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:23.110> any

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
win big and so that's basically it any

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.550 
win big and so that's basically it any
