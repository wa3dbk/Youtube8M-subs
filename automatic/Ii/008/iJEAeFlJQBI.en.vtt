00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
the body contracting the tricep at the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150 
the body contracting the tricep at the
bottom<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.600> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> fully<00:02:58.079> lengthen<00:02:58.739> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
bottom is going to fully lengthen the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
bottom is going to fully lengthen the
bicep<00:03:00.530> yeah<00:03:01.790> sorry<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.970> got<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> little<00:03:03.209> confused

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
bicep yeah sorry I got a little confused

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.349 
bicep yeah sorry I got a little confused
but<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:04.530> when<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.310> track<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.790> tricep<00:03:06.239> at

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
but so when you can track the tricep at

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.319 
but so when you can track the tricep at
the<00:03:06.450> bottom<00:03:06.889> you're<00:03:07.889> fully<00:03:08.190> lengthening<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
the bottom you're fully lengthening the

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.330 
the bottom you're fully lengthening the
Bison<00:03:09.900> which<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.769> going<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.190> work

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
Bison which is going to make it work

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.640 
Bison which is going to make it work
harder<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.480> even<00:03:12.930> though<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.139> might<00:03:13.380> do<00:03:13.620> a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
harder so even though you might do a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.650 
harder so even though you might do a
little<00:03:13.920> bit<00:03:14.100> less<00:03:14.340> weight<00:03:14.609> you're<00:03:15.389> going<00:03:15.569> to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
little bit less weight you're going to

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.009 
little bit less weight you're going to
get<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:16.079> better<00:03:16.350> muscle<00:03:16.709> fiber<00:03:17.040> recruitment<00:03:17.280> ok

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
get a better muscle fiber recruitment ok

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.910 
get a better muscle fiber recruitment ok
so<00:03:19.400> again<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:21.200> up<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.380> squeeze

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
so again just up and squeeze

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.960 
so again just up and squeeze
down<00:03:24.920> flex<00:03:25.989> up<00:03:27.220> all<00:03:28.220> right<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.580> one<00:03:28.730> thing<00:03:28.880> you

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
down flex up all right and one thing you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.370 
down flex up all right and one thing you
want<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.239> notice<00:03:29.569> when<00:03:30.020> you're<00:03:30.110> doing<00:03:30.349> your

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
bicep curls it doesn't matter on which

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.780 
bicep curls it doesn't matter on which
variation<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.260> these<00:03:33.410> when<00:03:34.340> you're<00:03:34.520> bringing
