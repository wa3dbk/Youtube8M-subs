00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.350
 you are not the center of the world 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.730
 would have said that often to bait me 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 as if it absolutely should not 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.299
 to be a reality but what is the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.929
 world the world is our planet our 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.900
 galaxy 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 the universe it's a lot of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.949
 people 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.250
 if the world is them I'm facing the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.439
 world 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.980
 but if the game becomes important or 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.019
 inversely the world ment globe so the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 world it's us 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.570
 and then if I love you the world it becomes 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.340
 you and me 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.340
 then you are not the center of the world 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.020
 the world is the world we all 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.620
 part of the world and we are all 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.460
 something so who am I in the world 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.909
 I do not know 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.979
 finally if I know in our world the one 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.740
 from the planet earth my name is james 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.500
 dio gentium austin she I come to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.210
 the year of my 21 years I was born on the 24th 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
 July 2012 in a country that was called 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.040
 France when my parents were my age 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.390
 since he changed his name a lot to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.080
 every time good political power has 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.460
 overthrown another 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.520
 just now I was talking about my agent 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.040
 but the world has made a name like a 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.960
 start if we live in a world that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.000
 is filled with individuals from groups of 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.660
 owned companies that shape our 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 reality 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.070
 so our world we built it 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.100
 so the beginning of our world 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.240
 his humankind debut if that's the case 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.460
 so the end of the world is not 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.259
 difficult to envision the end of the world 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.790
 maybe the end of humanity I 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.979
 grown up in a suburb of the capital 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.410
 and who by the way also saw her 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.759
 name changed many times my mother was 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.920
 a teacher in an elementary school 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.750
 close to home she was called 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.789
 hate and had a beautiful smile 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.530
 it was a loving mother still there 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.750
 for his child but who was wearing a 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.860
 great value to his work 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.390
 if they invest and so much that 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.650
 it was like a second life to such 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 point they meet there at my father 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.200
 it was the director of this same school 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.459
 my father a compassionate man 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
 is capable of great things 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.230
 if he had not been persuaded of the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.550
 truthfulness of his vision of the world 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 you noticed that I was talking about at 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.510
 past the end of humanity 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.780
 I think that every human being is a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.459
 day ask the question about his nature 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.930
 when I was born the world thought that his 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.819
 end was announced at the exhibition by a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.129
 tribe of central america since 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.330
 several hundred years each 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.430
 was unable to say what 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.739
 would actually actually happen each 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.989
 generation him his end of the world before 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.730
 Did 2012 happen in 2002 every 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.239
 religions human history have lived 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 in fear of an apocalypse 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.680
 so I grew up in single son protect 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.269
 educated by loving parents 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.010
 anxious to introduce the world to 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.840
 their children after school of my 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.190
 parents I went to college who 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.170
 was less than a kilometer from my home 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.459
 and then in high school that were him 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.730
 attached in fact 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.859
 in the end I never got out of this 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.230
 landscape between my house and my school at 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:20.540
 world and is rather reduced 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.200
 then my world is transforming little to 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.200
 little in hell 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.790
 this world there the one in which I live 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.890
 for 20 years now is a world 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.390
 tortured by extremism after a 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.310
 short period of growth in the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.200
 second half of the twentieth century our 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.980
 world slid slowly towards its loss 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.630
 a loss that starts in 2017 at the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.060
 fall of what was called republic 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.250
 nowadays this world is entitled to 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.870
 multiple violence the different 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.120
 powers that took over the country 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.420
 announced all to the people a kind of 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.800
 congratulate a loan a big crisis 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.360
 everyone said that social evil and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.890
 the country's economy was only 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.380
 and that they had the solutions that 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.180
 would lead the country to good weather after the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.590
 rain at least impulse been the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.640
 arguments they used to place 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.680
 emphatic powers that 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.930
 preceded and more time goes by and 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.500
 more and government approaching a 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.420
 dictatorship 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.950
 so the country has known about twenty 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.510
 of years a rise of extremism and 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.250
 today the last party to date 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.760
 totally lost control of the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.950
 population 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.320
 this malaise growing up a civil war 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.260
 unofficial settled down to live 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.460
 to do I mean survive you have to 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.650
 you're posted in front of your entry 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.180
 house with a rifle all night in 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.870
 hoping that no one will come to support 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.689
 your home 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.479
 and the people you love 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.099
 if not to massacre them it is so 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.299
 that my parents died my father 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.119
 wanted to prevent a man from us from 

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:44.259
 suitcases and what he's successful with using 

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:45.699
 tears he had bought two weeks 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.319
 earlier that he had not planned 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.989
 it was a second man slipped 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:54.789
 behind him accomplice of the first for 

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:55.809
 the dangers having seen my father get done 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.639
 murder under his eyes 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:59.319
 my mother rush inside and 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.959
 seize my arm to take me 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:07.739
 in the cellar where she hides me and ol 

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:07.739
 serve as a diversion to my escape 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.589
 I was 16 years old not pretty pretty humanity 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.699
 1 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.699
 that 's the end of the world 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:24.069
 so since the age of 16 so I 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.599
 tries to survive in the street by stealing 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.069
 abandoned or ruined houses 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.599
 following this crisis 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.599
 what are other countries doing to help us 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:35.039
 but it's all together with a smile 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.149
 we destroyed our world 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.219
 I remember when I was a bit more 

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:41.769
 young and that money still had some 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.919
 value at the time did not kill for 

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:43.919
 eat 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.240
 my only support my fellow travelers 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.950
 young vagrants sharing the same 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.870
 fate that me each having a story 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.280
 which he prefers to keep for himself for us 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.560
 there is no hope for the future 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.870
 the idea and survive this new world 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.350
 nothing more and for four years we 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.260
 got there until tonight 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.750
 well it must be 11 am I am 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.530
 waited there on a sidewalk in front of place 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.000
 it's raining in my chest the burn 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.530
 of a bullet that mad minister and the chief 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.900
 of a gang who had warned us 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.050
 to no longer publish on its territory 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.040

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.680
 trust 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.080
 the only one who was my friend another shot 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.210
 sounds and I see him crumble to five 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.700
 meters from my sad body or just fate 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.920

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.300
 that it is we are adapted to it and 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.990

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.810
 were intruders rain I do not feel it 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.550
 the more my eyes close and the black that 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.620
 are formed gradually engulfed the 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.660
 light of street lamps 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.920
