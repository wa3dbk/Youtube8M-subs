00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello girls welcome to this new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 video the tip this week has to 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.980
 see one of my beauty products 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.929
 favorites that are good lipsticks 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
 labial can completely change your 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.280
 face and raisin from being a zombie girl to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
 girl with attitude and today I 'm going to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.300
 teach three different ways to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:27.029
 occupy it today I'm going to use this 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.039
 red lipstick but these tips 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 work with any other color of the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.320
 skin the first way to occupy a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.270
 lipstick is like lip dye or lifting 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 for this what they are going to do is with their 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.250
 ring finger take a little lipstick and what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 they are going to put on their lips applying 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.629
 this flick will make 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.700
 the color is fixed and maintained for more 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.420
 time without having to apply lipstick 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.420
 directly 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.800
 the second way to use a lipstick is 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.110
 occupy it as cream blush for this 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.320
 what they are going to do is take the lipstick and 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.970
 apply a little on the back of your hand 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.159
 once they have done this they will take 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.050
 again your ring finger and they're going to 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.210
 blur 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.210
 once they feel that it is blurred 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.320
 they will apply small taps on their 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.320
 cheeks up 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.700
 and then they will fade with the greenery 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.830
 of the medium it is important that they begin 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.120
 less to more because if it's not going to be very 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.120
 difficult to remove the color 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.810
 there are two exceptions to use the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.820
 product in this way if they have 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.650
 granites or if they already got dust 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.390
 compact because if you do not you will not see 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.120
 natural and it's going to look like so there as 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.550
 a very strange makeup plant 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.950
 and finally the third way to occupy 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.780
 a lipstick is to use it to give it more 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 volume to our lips we're going 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.130
 to get it in the following way 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.410
 first they are going to apply a layer of lipstick 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.360
 and then they will remove it with a tissue 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.220
 Finally, they are going to apply some small 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.560
 drops of gloss in the middle part 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.930
 so that it is not very exaggerated and you see 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.210
 more natural they will realize that their 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.490
 lips will look thicker instantly 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.370
 is in the bottom part is not
