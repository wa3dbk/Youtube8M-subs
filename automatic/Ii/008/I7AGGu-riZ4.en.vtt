00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
only time they really stepped up into

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.140 
only time they really stepped up into
maybe<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.010> class<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:44.940> kind

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
maybe this kind of class so that's kind

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.790 
maybe this kind of class so that's kind
of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.300> red<00:01:45.480> flag<00:01:45.510> gear<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.140> did<00:01:46.260> have<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> you

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
in light of all that i'm thinking of

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.430 
in light of all that i'm thinking of
ohio<00:01:53.970> state<00:01:54.300> can<00:01:54.479> get<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.750> together<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.320> you

know you find the motivation here to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
know you find the motivation here to
give<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.870> hundred<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> five<00:01:58.500> percent<00:01:58.890> effort<00:01:59.070> i

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
give a hundred and five percent effort i

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700
