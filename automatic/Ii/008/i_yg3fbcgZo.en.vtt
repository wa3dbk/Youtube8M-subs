really like making those because they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.770 
really like making those because they
just<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.629> you're

the<00:01:12.450> magazine<00:01:14.240> does<00:01:15.240> remove<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> little

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the magazine does remove I have a little

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
the magazine does remove I have a little
bit<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> masking<00:01:18.330> tape<00:01:18.420> around<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.900> edges

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
bit of masking tape around the edges

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.280 
bit of masking tape around the edges
because<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.790> eight<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.780> they'd<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
because just the eight so they'd have a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.630 
because just the eight so they'd have a
tighter<00:01:22.350> fit<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> wouldn't<00:01:23.340> fall<00:01:23.430> out

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
tighter fit so it wouldn't fall out

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.289 
tighter fit so it wouldn't fall out
randomly<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> paper<00:01:25.860> tube<00:01:26.299> hardened

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
randomly this is a paper tube hardened

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.020 
randomly this is a paper tube hardened
so<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.650> charging<00:01:29.130> handle<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.640> work<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.000> just

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so the charging handle does work I just

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
so the charging handle does work I just
put<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.479> masking<00:01:30.840> tape<00:01:31.020> around<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
put some masking tape around here so it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.929 
put some masking tape around here so it
would<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.420> comfortable<00:01:34.340> as<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.610> see

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
would be more comfortable as you can see

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.830 
would be more comfortable as you can see
it<00:01:36.060> works<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:37.520> half<00:01:38.520> some<00:01:38.790> detail<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> fire

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it works on half some detail like a fire

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.480 
it works on half some detail like a fire
