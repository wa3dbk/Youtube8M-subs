00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the zig-zag stitch selected because that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.670 
the zig-zag stitch selected because that
allows<00:00:55.800> me

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.800 

or<00:00:59.100> anything<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.820> you're<00:01:00.030> sewing<00:01:00.450> which<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
or anything that you're sewing which is

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.460 
or anything that you're sewing which is
stretch<00:01:03.770> done<00:01:04.770> that<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.840> able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> stretch

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
stretch done that to be able to stretch

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.800 
stretch done that to be able to stretch
with<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> fabric<00:01:08.370> so<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.480> reason<00:01:09.600> why

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
with the fabric so that's the reason why

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.470 
with the fabric so that's the reason why
you<00:01:09.870> need<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.620> zig-zag<00:01:10.950> stitch<00:01:11.180> nice<00:01:12.180> as

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
you need to use a zig-zag stitch nice as

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.160 
you need to use a zig-zag stitch nice as
you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.730> that<00:01:14.850> there

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
you can see you can see that there

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
you can see you can see that there
there's<00:01:16.170> very<00:01:16.470> irregular<00:01:17.010> stitching<00:01:17.370> so<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
there's very irregular stitching so it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
there's very irregular stitching so it's
but<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.120> it's<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> zig-zag<00:01:18.720> stitch

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
but a little bit it's a zig-zag stitch

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.290 
but a little bit it's a zig-zag stitch
in<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.190> missed<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.730> in<00:01:20.940> there<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
in there and it's missed it in there so

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.790 
in there and it's missed it in there so
you<00:01:21.390> can't<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.080> definition<00:01:22.230> of<00:01:22.590> stitch

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
you can't see any definition of stitch

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.310 
you can't see any definition of stitch
in<00:01:22.980> there<00:01:23.190> so<00:01:23.760> that's<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.120> reason<00:01:24.450> why<00:01:24.690> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
in there so that's the reason why you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.640 
in there so that's the reason why you
shouldn't<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.680> using<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.600> regular<00:01:27.600> needle<00:01:27.840> now

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
shouldn't be using a regular needle now

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.720 
shouldn't be using a regular needle now
I'm<00:01:28.800> going<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.070> show<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.340> difference<00:01:29.670> between

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
I'm going to show the difference between

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.640 
I'm going to show the difference between
this<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.480> a<00:01:30.960> ballpoint<00:01:31.260> needle<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:34.440> now<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
searched my fourth one needle and as you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.740 
searched my fourth one needle and as you
can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.410> stretchy<00:01:37.710> fabric<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.750> I'm

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

the<00:02:06.570> first<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.489> that's<00:02:08.489> what<00:02:08.730> you<00:02:08.820> want

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the first one and that's what you want

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460 
the first one and that's what you want
and<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.660> ball<00:02:10.050> Point<00:02:10.380> needle

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and that's what a ball Point needle

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.130 
and that's what a ball Point needle
allows<00:02:11.010> you<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> reason<00:02:12.900> why<00:02:13.110> we

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
allows you to do now the reason why we

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.530 
allows you to do now the reason why we
don't<00:02:13.410> use<00:02:13.560> straight<00:02:13.950> stitch<00:02:14.300> can<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.360> hear

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
don't use straight stitch can you hear

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.759 
don't use straight stitch can you hear
that<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> see<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.709> it's<00:02:17.459> snapped<00:02:18.769> so

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
that we can you see that it's snapped so

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.949 
that we can you see that it's snapped so
now<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.519> show<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.540> exact

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
now I'm going to show you this exact

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:32.229 
now I'm going to show you this exact
stitch<00:02:22.700> under<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:23.820> sheet<00:02:28.519> down<00:02:29.550> screw<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.420> lip

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
stitch under my sheet down screw the lip

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.670 
stitch under my sheet down screw the lip
stitch

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
stitch

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:52.230 
stitch
and<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:46.560> friends<00:02:47.850> see<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.940> zigzag<00:02:51.090> six<00:02:52.090> like

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
and then friends see it zigzag six like

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.920 
and then friends see it zigzag six like
red<00:02:52.480> there<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.020> if<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.250> pull<00:02:54.810> there's<00:02:55.810> no

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
red there and if you pull there's no

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.930 
red there and if you pull there's no
snapping<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.620> that's<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.400> reason<00:02:57.850> you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
snapping and that's the reason you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.910 
snapping and that's the reason you
should<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.180> using<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.810> zig<00:02:59.140> zag<00:02:59.170> when<00:02:59.830> you

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
should be using a zig zag when you

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.410 
should be using a zig zag when you
actually<00:03:00.100> some<00:03:00.430> knit<00:03:00.760> fabrics

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.720 

just<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.570> recap<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.650> first<00:03:05.920> one<00:03:06.220> here<00:03:06.610> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
just to recap the first one here is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.030 
just to recap the first one here is
where<00:03:07.210> I've<00:03:07.420> used<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.930> regular<00:03:08.380> sewing<00:03:08.590> needle

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
where I've used a regular sewing needle

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.800 
where I've used a regular sewing needle
and<00:03:09.220> as<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:09.880> see<00:03:10.090> there's<00:03:10.300> lots<00:03:10.600> of

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
and as you can see there's lots of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.900 
and as you can see there's lots of
missed<00:03:11.080> stitches<00:03:11.560> there<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.520> that's<00:03:12.730> what

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
missed stitches there and that's what

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.330 
missed stitches there and that's what
happens<00:03:13.330> when<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.600> use<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.080> regular<00:03:14.560> needle<00:03:14.950> on

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
happens when you use a regular needle on

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.300 
happens when you use a regular needle on
knit<00:03:15.910> or<00:03:16.120> stretch<00:03:16.390> fabric<00:03:16.870> now<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.830> middle

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
knit or stretch fabric now the middle

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.910 
knit or stretch fabric now the middle
one<00:03:18.550> here<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.840> where<00:03:20.050> I've<00:03:20.380> used<00:03:20.710> a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
one here this is where I've used a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.100 
one here this is where I've used a
ballpoint<00:03:21.610> needle<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.300> I've<00:03:22.780> done<00:03:22.960> a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
ballpoint needle and I've done a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.110 
ballpoint needle and I've done a
straight<00:03:23.560> stitch<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.640> still<00:03:24.940> isn't

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
straight stitch and that still isn't

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.270 
straight stitch and that still isn't
working<00:03:25.390> as<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.440> see<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.980> break<00:03:27.250> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
working as you can see this break you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.780 
working as you can see this break you
drop<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.730> thread<00:03:28.050> there<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.560> there<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.280> it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
drop the thread there and there and it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.450 
drop the thread there and there and it
doesn't<00:03:30.940> allow<00:03:31.120> for<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:32.860> stretch<00:03:33.160> with

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
doesn't allow for it just stretch with

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.420 
doesn't allow for it just stretch with
the<00:03:33.490> fabric<00:03:33.810> now<00:03:34.810> with<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.290> final<00:03:35.800> one<00:03:35.920> here

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
the fabric now with the final one here

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.820 
the fabric now with the final one here
it's<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.300> zig-zag<00:03:37.750> stitch<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.290> I've<00:03:38.410> also<00:03:38.560> used

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
it's a zig-zag stitch and I've also used

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.360 
it's a zig-zag stitch and I've also used
the<00:03:38.980> ballpoint<00:03:39.550> needle<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.390> reason<00:03:40.870> why

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
the ballpoint needle and the reason why

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.560 
the ballpoint needle and the reason why
ballpoint<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.790> don't<00:03:42.970> get<00:03:43.060> any<00:03:43.210> breakage

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
ballpoint you don't get any breakage

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.080 
ballpoint you don't get any breakage
right<00:03:43.720> there<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.920> should<00:03:44.980> use<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.730> zig-zag

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
right there and you should use a zig-zag

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.850 
right there and you should use a zig-zag
stitch<00:03:46.300> because<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.810> stretches<00:03:47.290> with<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
stitch because it stretches with the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.920 
stitch because it stretches with the
fabric<00:03:48.340> I'll<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.030> pick<00:03:49.240> up<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:49.660> show<00:03:49.870> you

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
fabric I'll just pick up and show you

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.090 
fabric I'll just pick up and show you
see<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:51.490> doesn't<00:03:51.760> break<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:53.350> when<00:03:53.950> you're

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
see it doesn't break so when you're

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.480 
see it doesn't break so when you're
using<00:03:54.450> knit<00:03:55.450> stretch<00:03:56.200> fabric<00:03:56.740> zig-zag<00:03:57.460> stitch

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
using knit stretch fabric zig-zag stitch

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.410 
using knit stretch fabric zig-zag stitch
and<00:03:58.030> also<00:03:58.990> make<00:03:59.560> sure<00:03:59.590> you<00:04:00.220> use<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.640> ball<00:04:00.880> Point

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
and also make sure you use a ball Point

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.620 
and also make sure you use a ball Point
needle<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:03.210> hope<00:04:04.210> you<00:04:04.330> found<00:04:04.510> that
