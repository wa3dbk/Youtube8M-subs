lucas ridley com so here I am cutting
out<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> designs<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.350> took<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.710> four

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
out the designs this took about four

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.049 
out the designs this took about four
hours<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.489> cut<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> pieces<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.969> but<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
hours to cut all the pieces out but that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.380 
hours to cut all the pieces out but that
was<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> beginning<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.110> still

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
was just the beginning there was still

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
was just the beginning there was still
the<00:00:48.390> dividers<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.930> cut<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.100> gluing

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the dividers to cut and then gluing

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.630 
the dividers to cut and then gluing
everything<00:00:50.850> together<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.460> just<00:00:53.460> make<00:00:53.610> sure

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
everything together so just make sure

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
everything together so just make sure
when<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.180> cutting<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> put<00:00:54.930> some

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
when you're cutting that you put some

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.540 
when you're cutting that you put some
cardboard<00:00:55.350> underneath<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.070> don't<00:00:56.280> cut

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
cardboard underneath so you don't cut

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.709 
cardboard underneath so you don't cut
the<00:00:56.809> carpet<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.109> stuff<00:00:59.239> also<00:01:00.239> think

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the carpet and all that stuff also think

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.759 
the carpet and all that stuff also think
about<00:01:00.870> using<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> edges<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> cardboard

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
about using the edges of the cardboard

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.080 
about using the edges of the cardboard
putting<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.890> design<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> edge<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
putting your design at the edge of the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760 
putting your design at the edge of the
cardboard<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
cardboard so you don't have to make that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.719 
cardboard so you don't have to make that
extra<00:01:08.250> long<00:01:08.580> cut<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.710> total<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.580> need

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
extra long cut so all in total you need

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.880 
extra long cut so all in total you need
three<00:01:12.030> face<00:01:12.270> pieces<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.080> about<00:01:13.229> twenty

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
three face pieces and about twenty

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
three face pieces and about twenty
inside<00:01:14.700> pieces<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.390> those<00:01:15.540> 20<00:01:15.840> inside

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
inside pieces that those 20 inside

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
inside pieces that those 20 inside
pieces<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.650> sandwiched<00:01:17.189> by<00:01:17.369> those<00:01:17.549> face

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
pieces are sandwiched by those face

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.170 
pieces are sandwiched by those face
pieces<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.950> then<00:01:19.950> you'll<00:01:20.130> need<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> cut<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
pieces and then you'll need to cut a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.840 
pieces and then you'll need to cut a
bunch<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.720> dividers<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.680> yours<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.280> where<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
bunch of dividers and yours like where I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.800 
bunch of dividers and yours like where I
chose<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.710> place<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.540> reinforce<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
chose to to place them and reinforce the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
chose to to place them and reinforce the
bookshelf<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.770> those<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.759> serve<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
bookshelf and that those will serve to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.969 
bookshelf and that those will serve to
double<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> depth<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> bookshelf<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.540> to

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
double the depth of the bookshelf and to

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
double the depth of the bookshelf and to
that's<00:01:34.979> we're<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> glue<00:01:35.900> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that's we're going to put the glue so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130 
that's we're going to put the glue so
here<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.380> gluing<00:01:37.740> everything<00:01:38.159> together<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
here I'm gluing everything together and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.360 
here I'm gluing everything together and
I<00:01:40.170> only<00:01:40.560> did<00:01:40.800> about<00:01:40.830> three<00:01:41.160> at<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> time

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
I only did about three at a time

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.060 
I only did about three at a time
together<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.500> guerrilla<00:01:43.500> glue<00:01:43.650> sets<00:01:43.920> up

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
together because guerrilla glue sets up

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
together because guerrilla glue sets up
really<00:01:44.100> quickly<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.810> put

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
really quickly and you need to put

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
really quickly and you need to put
pressure<00:01:46.230> on<00:01:46.500> fairly<00:01:47.430> soon<00:01:47.730> after<00:01:48.000> you're

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pressure on fairly soon after you're

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
pressure on fairly soon after you're
done<00:01:48.570> boiling<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.440> only<00:01:49.830> did<00:01:49.980> three<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
done boiling so I only did three at a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
done boiling so I only did three at a
time<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.720> only<00:01:51.840> need<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.140> put

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
time for that and you only need to put

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.120 
time for that and you only need to put
like<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.770> dot<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.400> gorilla<00:01:54.150> glue

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
like a little dot because gorilla glue

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.220 
like a little dot because gorilla glue
increases<00:01:56.130> by<00:01:56.610> four<00:01:56.940> times<00:01:57.150> when<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.110> it's

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
increases by four times when when it's

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.000 
increases by four times when when it's
drying<00:01:59.660> so<00:02:00.660> here<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.500> am<00:02:01.620> just<00:02:01.710> putting

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
drying so here I am just putting

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.090 
drying so here I am just putting
everything<00:02:02.280> together<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:03.770> making<00:02:04.770> sure<00:02:05.010> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
everything together and making sure to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.359 
everything together and making sure to
put<00:02:05.250> pressure<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.730> it<00:02:05.760> after<00:02:06.300> I'm<00:02:06.390> done<00:02:07.369> so

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
put pressure on it after I'm done so

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.680 
put pressure on it after I'm done so
cutting<00:02:08.670> all<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.940> dividers<00:02:09.300> probably<00:02:09.630> took

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
cutting all the dividers probably took

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.940 
cutting all the dividers probably took
about<00:02:09.899> eight<00:02:10.110> hours<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.710> gluing

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
about eight hours and then gluing

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.240 
about eight hours and then gluing
everything<00:02:11.190> together<00:02:11.640> provider

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
everything together provider

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.110 
everything together provider
or<00:02:13.640> something<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.490> when<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.000> was

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
or something like that so when I was

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.280 
or something like that so when I was
thinking<00:02:17.240> about<00:02:17.360> mounting<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:17.990> wasn't

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
thinking about mounting and I wasn't

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.510 
thinking about mounting and I wasn't
sure<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.410> was<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.680> do<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.250> luckily

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
sure I was going to do it but luckily

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.990 
sure I was going to do it but luckily
with<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.880> design<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:21.110> able<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.380> hang<00:02:22.070> the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
with this design I was able to hang the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.120 
with this design I was able to hang the
bookshelf<00:02:23.420> from<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.350> inside<00:02:24.740> square

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
bookshelf from that inside square

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.000 
bookshelf from that inside square
instead<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.730> trying<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> mount<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.620> bottom

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
instead of trying to mount it the bottom

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.980 
instead of trying to mount it the bottom
the<00:02:28.790> only<00:02:28.910> thing<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:29.270> holding<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.630> up<00:02:29.750> is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the only thing that's holding it up is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.940 
the only thing that's holding it up is
it's<00:02:30.200> actually<00:02:30.290> hanging<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.270> two<00:02:32.270> nails<00:02:32.540> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it's actually hanging from two nails and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.700 
it's actually hanging from two nails and
have<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.100> extra<00:02:34.550> curtain<00:02:34.910> rod<00:02:35.120> holder<00:02:35.710> to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
have this extra curtain rod holder to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.190 
have this extra curtain rod holder to
hold<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.980> up

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.240 

another<00:02:43.200> nice<00:02:43.410> thing<00:02:43.440> about<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:43.860> design<00:02:44.190> is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
another nice thing about this design is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.390 
another nice thing about this design is
the<00:02:44.580> extra<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.120> pockets<00:02:46.160> outside<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the extra little pockets outside of the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.660 
the extra little pockets outside of the
cloud

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
cloud

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.210 
cloud
so<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.450> hope<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.630> all<00:02:50.870> made<00:02:51.230> sense<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.770> hope

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
so I hope that all made sense and hope

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.000 
so I hope that all made sense and hope
you<00:02:52.340> give<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.610> try<00:02:52.819> it's<00:02:53.780> uh<00:02:54.020> took<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.860> little

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
you give it a try it's uh took a little

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.590 
you give it a try it's uh took a little
long<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.430> thought<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.730> would<00:02:55.850> but<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.150> was

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
long and I thought it would but it was

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.440 
long and I thought it would but it was
worth<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.080> think<00:02:57.760> also<00:02:58.760> feel<00:02:59.000> free<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.209> check

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
worth it I think also feel free to check

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.690 
worth it I think also feel free to check
