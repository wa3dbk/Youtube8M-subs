00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
can see how the glass is curved this is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.290 
can see how the glass is curved this is
like<00:00:24.529> a<00:00:24.560> magnifying<00:00:25.070> glass<00:00:25.400> that<00:00:25.910> you<00:00:25.939> might

where was I the diameter the lens and
the<00:02:18.530> focal<00:02:18.980> length<00:02:19.010> determine<00:02:19.819> what<00:02:19.969> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
the focal length determine what the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:53.940 
the focal length determine what the
f-stop<00:02:20.629> is<00:02:21.790> formula<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:23.060> f-stop
