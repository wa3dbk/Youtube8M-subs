00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
industry that they know very well

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.469 
industry that they know very well
because<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> feel<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.360> an

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
because I feel like they have an

because I feel like they have an

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
experience and if from information

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.800 
experience and if from information
advantage<00:01:53.579> over<00:01:53.880> most<00:01:54.149> others<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.750> they

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
advantage over most others and they

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.899 
advantage over most others and they
probably<00:01:55.020> due<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.470> some<00:01:55.979> degree<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.729> that's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
probably due to some degree so that's

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.510 
probably due to some degree so that's
that's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.420> trend<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:58.680> last<00:01:58.860> two<00:01:59.070> trends<00:01:59.310> I've

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's a trend the last two trends I've

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.260 
that's a trend the last two trends I've

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
seen the first one is mergers and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.690 
seen the first one is mergers and
acquisitions<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:05.100> seeing<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.549> of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
acquisitions I'm seeing a lot of

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.059 
acquisitions I'm seeing a lot of
interest<00:02:07.420> from<00:02:08.200> some<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.590> larger<00:02:08.920> more

their national or global brand and i
also<00:02:22.989> just<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.880> industry<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.630> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
also just see that the industry is the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.839 
also just see that the industry is the
last<00:02:26.709> trend<00:02:26.950> here<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> industry<00:02:27.640> is

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
last trend here is that the industry is

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.120 
last trend here is that the industry is
fragmented<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.650> relates<00:02:29.860> to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
fragmented and this relates to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.320 
fragmented and this relates to
everything<00:02:30.190> else<00:02:30.519> i<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:30.790> talked<00:02:30.970> about<00:02:31.090> it

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
everything else i just talked about it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.640 
everything else i just talked about it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
of those things are leading to a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.240 
of those things are leading to a

and acquisition demand and really

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.160 
and acquisition demand and really
eventually<00:02:51.459> there<00:02:51.730> will<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.329> three<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.959> five

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
