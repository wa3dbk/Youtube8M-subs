00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
 all right 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.950
 this is one of the most 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.960
 repeated by a broker look at his plan 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.639
 of training equal to the manager 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.590
 of an important company consult your 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.660
 agenda before starting to work the 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.459
 rones we should have this paper as 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.850
 an elusive line that marks us the 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.850
 path 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.160
 now that you have raised a challenge not 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.530
 you must forget that a good 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.750
 planning is the key to success and you 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.610
 you have blunt to the trainings of the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.860
 table four days a week four 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.740
 days a week with a coach 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.540
 four days a week usually the 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.610
 planning is essential to have a 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.080
 schedule routine workouts 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.220
 just as you are starting to run that 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.110
 go to do a test of 10 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.329
 kilometers a half or that you have 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 raised the marathon 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.050
 in three weeks so we're going 68 km 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.270
 and Saturday 10 km and Sunday 12 15 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.500
 Tuesday Thursday Saturday mingo is very 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.480
 habitual is something that we do some 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.820
 popular race on weekend and what 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.040
 I make active rest also that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.930
 we have good to run so some kind of 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.420
 sport to not also saturate the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.400
 body every person is a world and by 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 There is so much a training plan for 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.000
 each runner 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.400
 it also depends a bit on the ability 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.900
 of each person, everything is the same, there is 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.050
 people who are very prepared and who 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.570
 they have that has a high capacity and 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.670
 can do more, that's not why it's important 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.220
 that people mark some 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.830
 objectives that are realistic your body 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 He gave you to accompany you the resistance to 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.750
 the essences are worked we are going to put 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.479
 as an example to a middle runner with a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.460
 age of 35 years old man and she leads 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.560
 We will prepare a running time 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.970
 for a 10- kilometer race 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.130
 our plan states that we must 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.479
 train four days a week with 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.530
 distances that we will go up 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.600
 progressively 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.910
 we will also combine slower rhythms 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.950
 with other faster like this for two 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.140
 months we have our plan 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.369
 training if you do not follow you will have more 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.369
 the half way
