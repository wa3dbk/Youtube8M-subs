 Water 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.850
 Doña Maura who lives from her crops of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.000
 Salt and pumpkins spent on buying 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.130
 water 400 soles himself 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 we bought with tank truck and 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.630
 sometimes many times we have brought 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.410

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.410
 in drums 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 but in a time of crisis is that they arise 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.620
 the best ideas and that's how the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.440
 trancebright creation of the movement 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.710
 Peruvians without water at the national level 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.950

 we are not giving water to them 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.420
 through these large meshes that 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.759
 Suspended in the air trap moisture 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.150
 from the mist they filter it and they carry 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.280
 its tanks so a gray day is synonymous 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.909
 of joy and life

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.980
