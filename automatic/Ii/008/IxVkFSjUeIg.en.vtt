00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.350
 yes hello dear bodybuilding friends 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.420
 it would be breitstein next to me 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.320
 is never accesses it German champion 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.100
 2007 and now in his comeback 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.540
 the german championship 2010 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.270
 Today we show you some belly 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.570
 exercises and directed once for it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.000
 demonstrate 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.190
 as the first exercise for drive us the wreath 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.200
 show the classic abdominal muscle 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.200
 crunch an exercise specifically for the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.729
 upper abdominal muscle is suitable 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.960
 or exactly this 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.630
 you can practice very well 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 see how the abdominal muscles work 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.660
 wonderful back is always beautiful 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.130
 flat on the bench that is here too 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.399
 no overload in the bottom 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.280
 Spine comes and the breathing drive 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.180
 is clear when exhale when high 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 inhale 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.220
 as a second exercise shows us ripe the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.369
 reverse can be an exercise specific to 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.420
 The lower abdomen is on here 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.579
 the musculus rectus abdo - on the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.830
 straight abdominal muscles and here at the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.110
 lower abdomen wonderful to see 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.929
 Here we see that mature in top form is 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.929
 and a super six pack is very good 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.879
 yes and for a very good 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.670
 abdominal muscle belongs next to one 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.860
 very high chiseled upper and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 lower abdominal muscles also a very 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.269
 good visible lateral abdominal muscles 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.580
 the very atus muscle or sawtooth 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.620
 Muscle called to it and that too shows 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.050
 Here we are almost perfect 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.120
 for rotating the upper body a little 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.120
 on the side and was very specifically the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.950
 lateral abdominal muscle the serratos dem 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.950
 routes dental muscles in training 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.640
 important is also about the optimal 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.560
 to get that in the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.420
 end position in the controlled 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 position once pressed correctly 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.530
 in the abdominal musculature, too 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.760
 very mature that you have optimized here 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.769
 can see how the abdominal muscles get in 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.829
 the strongest position right now 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.599
 Optimal control only records that 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.639
 also a pro from what he exactly 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.719
 here knows the muscles specifically 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.719
 can burden 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.409
 the exercise that ralf us now for this 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.680
 it is impressively demonstrated 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.239
 In addition to hanging an exercise special or 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.129
 primarily for advanced 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.290
 athletes because they are already higher 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.750
 requirements for contraction 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.920
 skill of the abdominal muscles we provides 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.930
 See this very nice the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.549
 lower abdominal muscles again first 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.519
 line would be strained now 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.319
 the knee slightly to the side then turns the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.150
 we again like the very atus muscle here 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.310
 very nice the above 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.720
 back muscles contract and that 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.040
 same goes next to it for the other 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.340
 page 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.530
 Here we see that kind of technology is like that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.359
 far as I think, as always 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.060
 at the strenuous phase at the leg 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.199
 lift out and exhale when lowering 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.199
 inhale legs 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.370
 yes, this exercise that ralf us here now 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.710
 shows is an exercise specifically for the 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.010
 transverse abdominal muscle 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.290
 so-called musculus transfers 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.850
 dominice his hold exercise the too 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.010
 at the same time the lower back 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.410
 strengthens that is also important that 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.990
 abdominal muscles and the lower 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.960
 back muscles evenly built 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.990
 becomes optimally around the spine 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.180
 Support by a strong muscle corset 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.730
 this exercise for the musculus transfers 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.170
 ab dominant is this muscle is one 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.080
 muscle even at low 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.330
 Body fat percentage is not visible but 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.790
 to an optimal medium 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.280
 but it is decisive 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.390
 because this muscle gives the whole 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.950
 medium part strength and stability 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.780
 important here is that the back of the 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.030
 we are always watching very nice here 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.370
 will be kept the abdominal muscles 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.600
 moved in and so we come 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.250
 here to an optimal tension 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.930
 advanced athletes can too 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.060
 in this exercise, the intensity 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.000
 By doing so they increase one almost for 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.350
 lift one foot and a few to the front 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.060
 pull and then we have that we see 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.230
 here a very very strong tension then 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.520
 grabs very nice 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.000
 the same applies to the other one 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.810
 leg still briefly to the duration of the hold 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.570
 if we have the normal position 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.880
 The goal is up to 60 seconds to do this exercise 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.410
 to hold on the piece and of it two to 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.690
 to complete three passes 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.220
 lifting the leg then reach 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.220
 over a 10 to 15 seconds
