should I either get blonde highlights
again<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.150> could<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.750> home<00:02:12.780> it'll

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
again I could just do it at home it'll

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.110 
again I could just do it at home it'll
be<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.520> they'll<00:02:14.670> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
be like for a little but they'll you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.820 
be like for a little but they'll you
know<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.050> gonna<00:02:16.170> look<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.500> my<00:02:16.650> hair

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830

know it's just gonna look all my hair
always<00:02:16.950> looks<00:02:17.040> or<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.030> was<00:02:18.390> thinking<00:02:18.810> should<00:02:19.260> I

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
always looks or I was thinking should I

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.610 
always looks or I was thinking should I
get<00:02:19.590> brown<00:02:20.310> highlights<00:02:20.970> everywhere<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
get brown highlights everywhere so that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.979 
get brown highlights everywhere so that
kind<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.550> for<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> colder<00:02:24.270> season<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:24.870> going

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
kind of for the colder season I'm going

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.390 
kind of for the colder season I'm going
to<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> little<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.500> darker<00:02:25.709> hair<00:02:26.129> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
to have a little bit darker hair and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
to have a little bit darker hair and
also<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.480> reason<00:02:27.629> why<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:28.260> thinking<00:02:28.530> of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
also the reason why I was thinking of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860 
also the reason why I was thinking of
doing<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.040> because<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.269> won't<00:02:30.720> have

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
doing that is because then I won't have

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.660 
doing that is because then I won't have
to<00:02:30.959> do<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.260> roots<00:02:31.530> as<00:02:31.709> much<00:02:31.920> because<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
to do my roots as much because if the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.540 
to do my roots as much because if the
highlights<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.840> more<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.190> brown

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
highlights like more of the brown

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.369 
highlights like more of the brown
highlights<00:02:35.849> kind<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.330> matched<00:02:36.540> my<00:02:36.810> roots<00:02:37.110> it

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
highlights kind of matched my roots it

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.380 
highlights kind of matched my roots it
will<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.680> easier<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.459> me<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.819> get<00:02:39.060> away<00:02:39.120> with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
will be easier for me to get away with

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.229 
will be easier for me to get away with
not<00:02:40.140> touching<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.920> my<00:02:40.950> roots<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> long<00:02:41.940> time

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
not touching up my roots for a long time

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.390 
not touching up my roots for a long time
do<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.629> guys<00:02:42.720> something<00:02:43.019> because<00:02:43.530> I'll<00:02:44.010> do

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
do you guys something because I'll do

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.040 
do you guys something because I'll do
highlights<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.879> kind<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> match<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.629> natural

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
highlights that kind of match my natural

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.949 
highlights that kind of match my natural
hair<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.459> thinking<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.120> those<00:02:48.569> those<00:02:48.930> are

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
hair so thinking that those those are

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.110 
hair so thinking that those those are
the<00:02:49.110> two<00:02:49.260> options<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.819> should<00:02:50.819> i<00:02:50.910> go<00:02:51.090> for

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the two options for should i go for

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.690 
the two options for should i go for
ombre<00:02:51.750> ombre<00:02:52.620> however<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.190> say<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.430> where

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
ombre ombre however you say it where

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
ombre ombre however you say it where
it's<00:02:53.790> laying<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.239> bottom<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.810> then<00:02:55.319> dark

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it's laying on the bottom and then dark

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.040 
it's laying on the bottom and then dark
at<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.830> top<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.459> if<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.910> did<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.840> I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
at the top and if I did that then I

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.050 
at the top and if I did that then I
would<00:02:58.140> probably<00:03:00.650> like<00:03:01.650> lighten<00:03:02.489> some<00:03:02.819> hair

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
would probably like lighten some hair

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.530 
would probably like lighten some hair
down<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.620> only<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.909> all<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
down here like only not all of it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
down here like only not all of it
because<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.900> don't<00:03:07.050> want<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.260> too<00:03:07.379> dramatic<00:03:07.980> but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
because I don't want it too dramatic but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.990 
because I don't want it too dramatic but
like<00:03:09.860> imagine<00:03:10.860> highlights<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.640> bottom

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
like imagine highlights on the bottom

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
like imagine highlights on the bottom
like<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.629> I<00:03:12.659> could<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.349> easily<00:03:13.650> at<00:03:13.860> home

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
like that I could do that easily at home

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
like that I could do that easily at home
and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:15.000> I'd<00:03:15.209> probably<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.720> let<00:03:16.170> my<00:03:16.319> roots

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
and then I'd probably just let my roots

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.410 
and then I'd probably just let my roots
grow<00:03:16.860> out<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.459> should<00:03:17.849> I<00:03:17.909> have<00:03:18.120> blonde

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
grow out so should I have blonde

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.210 
grow out so should I have blonde
