I'm<00:01:37.140> using<00:01:38.060> silver<00:01:39.060> wire<00:01:39.500> now<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I'm using silver wire now do like the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
I'm using silver wire now do like the
UTC<00:01:41.490> solve<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.479> wire<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.200> nice<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
UTC solve a wire because it's nice and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.179 
UTC solve a wire because it's nice and
bright<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> catch<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.860> where<00:01:50.070> there

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
bright so catch that same as where there

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
bright so catch that same as where there
are<00:01:50.310> flies<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.479> tie<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> length

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
are flies on will it tie it the length

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.190 
are flies on will it tie it the length
of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> body<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.189> gonna<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
of the body so I'm gonna go right on

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.780 
of the body so I'm gonna go right on
doing<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> catch<00:01:56.579> an

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
doing that up I'm just going to catch an

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.130 
doing that up I'm just going to catch an
another<00:01:56.909> start<00:01:57.270> because<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> last<00:01:57.719> thing<00:01:57.840> you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
another start because the last thing you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.310 
another start because the last thing you
want<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> body<00:01:59.490> varnish<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
want as you do the body varnish all and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410 
want as you do the body varnish all and
then<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.590> go<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
then you go back to do that up and that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
then you go back to do that up and that
I<00:02:03.450> popped<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:04.049> because<00:02:04.350> you've<00:02:04.590> only<00:02:04.829> secured

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I popped out because you've only secured

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.029 
I popped out because you've only secured
that<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.700> two<00:02:05.969> or<00:02:06.090> three<00:02:06.240> thumbs<00:02:06.540> after<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
that with two or three thumbs after it

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.469 
that with two or three thumbs after it
right<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.550> nice<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.759> secure

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
right so it's nice and secure

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.130 
right so it's nice and secure
you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:09.989> ya

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
you can see ya

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.500 
you can see ya
you<00:02:11.650> see<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.920> running<00:02:12.100> rate<00:02:12.460> up<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.000> seed<00:02:13.210> I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
you see it running rate up the seed I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.540 
you see it running rate up the seed I
mean<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.440> basically<00:02:14.620> running<00:02:15.160> right<00:02:15.370> up

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
mean it's basically running right up
