00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.750
 good evening everyone and 21 European and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.480
 today I will teach you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 heal from nique to groupies so 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.670
 first of all you should go you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 have to go to covan full goal 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 death it was possible for you to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.720
 to heal you are going to have to recover 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.780
 a witch's head 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.630
 finally two pistons trees that are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.410
 in the cave during the missions of 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.120
 companions called blood debt 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 you have as a goal we owe 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 kill out the witches out of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.050
 bengorine and recover one of their 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 heads 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.890
 so what are we going to do a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 second time 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 then you go up 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.830
 find the location of the strings 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 awful that you killed before 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.580
 so mine 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.870
 yes she is here so after they are 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.840
 dead where you just have to look for it 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.170
 can directly see that you can 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.620
 directly retrieve the head of the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.930
 witch 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.600
 so the only thing you have us at 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.560
 to do it's just to recover ya no 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.260
 so one therefore no steps 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.600
 particular to do for you there up 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:47.110
 the kill recuperator after that 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.110
 stand out from the right 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:25.970
 once out you will lead 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:27.069
 to the tomb 10 grams gold all 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.599
 honor of the map 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.599
 justin moves from the green party academy 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.480
 m 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.900
 so once inside you go 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.420
 must have made the path that you 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.459
 have before but if you already have 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.159
 completed the mission would have to take 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.629
 the path you were given at the end 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.629
 a desire for truth 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.900
 and you will come back to this room and 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.750
 so you're going to use the flame of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.850
 the hÃ©rault and after you have to ask if 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.840

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.760
 witch in the flames in order to 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.760

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:03.130
