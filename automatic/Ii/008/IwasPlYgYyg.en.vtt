00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.960
 I learned by year 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.379
 only in a second course that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.449
 found between the arches there a street of 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.269
 Arcane and Sieve Street 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.309
 there was in the second courtyard a 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.140
 monument that was interested me 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.449
 it's a neighboring owner who 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.790
 told me so go see that and as I 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.480
 did not know he led me what did 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.600
 not been my amazement to see in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 this shabby little courtyard a gallery 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.160
 undisturbed rebirth two arcades 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.009
 supported by columns hex 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.110
 with an extraordinary capital and 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:15.330
 mostly interconnected by the arches 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.119
 lowered which are the characteristic of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 rebirth in addition to above the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.110
 gallery there is a pure handrail 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 birth this monument was therefore a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.140
 left tackle there by chance and yet 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.420
 we have suffered lons saloon as 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.220
 in all France counted 100 times 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.289
 of war 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.899
 this discovery the best yet 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.119
 this considerable because it's a hassle 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.880
 perpetual that France counts there suffered 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.830
 we completely wiped out the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 saunier was wiped out three times of 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.080
 after all it was necessary to rebuild everything it took 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 same round have repopulated these are 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.660
 Savoyards who repopulated France 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.450
 therefore counted how to explain that this 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.390
 monument is not destroyed and well 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.270
 it's this can i stay on can not 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 know now listen that he has his 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.500
 original place is what it would be 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.360
 maybe some stones that have been 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 re-used that would come from 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.590
 cat castle no it could be 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.050
 very well this gallery could have 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.700
 belong to the entourage in cats 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.140
 no it is very likely 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450
 especially since there have been rays 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.030
 further from the stones of the castle of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.610
 cats no so the number 14 of the street 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.550
 Cordeliers where street art 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.500
 arcades where there is a gargoyle 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.280
 at the front door of the hallway 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.340
 this gargoyle and last 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.500
 without it comes from the castle see you 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.330
 she we have the pieces of clay that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.450
 say that when the castle was 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.150
 destroyed the stones were sold in 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.190
 adjudication then all that's hers but 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.080
 it gives us no explanation all of 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.640
 same from this gallery is she is there 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.709
 this is the main 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.020
 it is certain that if it is repaired 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.720
 results in a bit shaggy 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.560
 especially since I told you about 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.830
 two arcades 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.870
 but there are four in fact both 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.570
 others are hidden by a little a little 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.239
 wall that helped to make a small 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.340
 shed but all that but it's the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.860
 glory of lons the saunier is our 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.860
 ancient history these are our ancestors
