heavy line here you can't afford a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.620 
heavy line here you can't afford a
tangle<00:01:46.700> when<00:01:46.820> you're<00:01:46.939> shooting<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.420> big

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
tangle when you're shooting for a big

tangle when you're shooting for a big
fish<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.799> rod<00:01:49.070> has<00:01:49.579> are<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> new

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
fish and this rod has are a new

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.810 
fish and this rod has are a new
proprietary<00:01:51.530> technology<00:01:52.130> for<00:01:52.310> us<00:01:52.399> what<00:01:52.640> we're

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
proprietary technology for us what we're

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.459 
proprietary technology for us what we're
doing<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.600> we're<00:01:53.780> using<00:01:53.810> four<00:01:54.439> different

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
doing is we're using four different

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.100 
doing is we're using four different
carbons<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.490> generate<00:01:55.909> this<00:01:56.060> rod<00:01:56.329> what<00:01:56.899> that

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
carbons to generate this rod what that

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.450 
carbons to generate this rod what that
does<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.560> gives<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> little<00:01:58.100> bit<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.399> a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
does is gives you a little bit of a

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.580 
does is gives you a little bit of a
softer<00:01:58.850> tip<00:01:59.090> while<00:01:59.630> still<00:01:59.930> maintaining<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
softer tip while still maintaining the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.170 
softer tip while still maintaining the
power<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.250> need<00:02:01.280> for<00:02:01.729> fighting<00:02:02.060> these

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
power that you need for fighting these

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.950 
power that you need for fighting these
big<00:02:02.570> big<00:02:03.320> toothy<00:02:03.770> critters<00:02:04.130> right<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.820> know

day I you have a tendency to over grip
the<00:02:25.250> rod<00:02:25.459> yeah<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.390> work<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.750> you're

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the rod yeah you know to work and you're

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.660 
the rod yeah you know to work and you're
really<00:02:27.230> squeezing<00:02:27.709> down<00:02:28.100> at<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.549> as<00:02:28.640> a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
result what happens is as you're hauling

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.860 
result what happens is as you're hauling
this<00:02:30.769> you're<00:02:30.950> starting<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.310> throw<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.790> mean<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
this you're starting to throw I mean you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
really putting too much pressure into

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.610 
really putting too much pressure into
the<00:02:34.879> ride<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.360> letting<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> rod<00:02:35.959> load<00:02:36.379> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
the ride out letting the rod load and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.380 
the ride out letting the rod load and
release<00:02:36.950> we're<00:02:37.580> trying<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.909> push<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.269> through

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
release we're trying to push it through

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.610 
release we're trying to push it through
and<00:02:38.480> you're<00:02:38.659> actually<00:02:38.959> pushing<00:02:39.140> yourself

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
and you're actually pushing yourself

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.470 
and you're actually pushing yourself
through<00:02:39.890> your<00:02:39.920> cast<00:02:40.340> yeah<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.030> timing<00:02:41.420> is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
through your cast yeah and the timing is

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.390 
through your cast yeah and the timing is
off<00:02:41.659> on<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.930> but<00:02:42.049> I<00:02:42.200> mean<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> way<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.890> sits

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
off on it but I mean the way this sits

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.009 
off on it but I mean the way this sits
in<00:02:43.549> your<00:02:43.670> hand<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:44.090> mean<00:02:44.239> it's<00:02:44.360> just<00:02:44.390> it's<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
in your hand I mean it's just it's a

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.990 
in your hand I mean it's just it's a
marketing<00:02:45.799> it's<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.190> remarkably<00:02:46.730> comfortable

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
marketing it's a remarkably comfortable

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420 
marketing it's a remarkably comfortable
handle<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.989> enables<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.709> push<00:02:49.190> through

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
handle it enables you to push through

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.640 
handle it enables you to push through
that<00:02:49.549> final<00:02:50.090> cast<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.170> comfortable

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
that final cast that it's so comfortable

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.979 
that final cast that it's so comfortable
yeah<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.340> less<00:02:52.610> effort<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.150> use<00:02:53.390> generally

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
yeah the less effort you use generally

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.660 
yeah the less effort you use generally
is<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.260> best<00:02:54.470> way<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.680> go<00:02:54.950> go<00:02:55.159> ahead<00:02:55.310> trying

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
is the best way to go go ahead trying

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.789 
is the best way to go go ahead trying
too<00:02:55.849> hard<00:02:55.879> makes<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.480> rod<00:02:56.659> fail<00:02:56.959> or<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.590> line

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
too hard makes the rod fail or the line

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.949 
too hard makes the rod fail or the line
tale<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.239> gives<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.569> that<00:02:59.599> much

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
tale so this just gives you that much

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.569 
tale so this just gives you that much
better<00:03:00.200> ability<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.620> do<00:03:00.799> that<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.190> can<00:03:01.340> feel

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
better ability to do that you can feel

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.399 
better ability to do that you can feel

everything yeah not saying the court

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.589 
everything yeah not saying the court
doesn't<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.099> this<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.819> just<00:03:05.180> something<00:03:05.480> new
