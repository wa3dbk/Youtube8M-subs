figure<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.570> what's<00:00:18.750> wrong<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:20.869> yeah

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
figure out what's wrong with it yeah

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.920 
figure out what's wrong with it yeah
doesn't<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.590> look<00:00:22.800> great<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.269> does<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
doesn't that look great it just does and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.870 
doesn't that look great it just does and
it's<00:00:28.830> been<00:00:29.039> making<00:00:29.220> more<00:00:30.000> noise<00:00:30.269> than<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
it's been making more noise than that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
it's been making more noise than that
except<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.930> gone<00:00:34.140> gone<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
except it so now it's gone gone to this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.190 
except it so now it's gone gone to this
solid<00:00:35.070> color<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:37.550> then<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.610> flickers<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.510 

this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.350> actually<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> new<00:00:43.890> pattern<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this is actually a new pattern for the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.639 
this is actually a new pattern for the
last<00:00:44.670> couple<00:00:44.850> weeks<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.390> been<00:00:45.600> doing<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
last couple weeks it's been doing that

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
last couple weeks it's been doing that
moving<00:00:47.489> noisy<00:00:47.969> pattern<00:00:48.360> there<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> right

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
moving noisy pattern there on the right

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
moving noisy pattern there on the right
but<00:00:49.260> now<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.800> starting<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
but now it's starting to out with a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.680 
but now it's starting to out with a
solid<00:00:51.629> pattern<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> takes<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> few<00:00:54.390> minutes

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
solid pattern and it takes a few minutes

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.930 
solid pattern and it takes a few minutes
before<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:56.149> resolved<00:01:01.520> but<00:01:02.520> eventually

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
before it's all resolved but eventually

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.710 
before it's all resolved but eventually
the<00:01:03.000> picture<00:01:03.300> will<00:01:03.420> start<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> materialize

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
the picture will start to materialize

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.789 
the picture will start to materialize
it's<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.990> frustrating<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.560> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's really frustrating because this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's really frustrating because this
thing<00:01:07.979> costs<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.640> money<00:01:09.290> back<00:01:10.290> when

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
thing costs a lot of money back when

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.270 
thing costs a lot of money back when
these<00:01:10.590> things<00:01:10.770> were<00:01:10.979> still<00:01:11.189> really<00:01:11.610> expensive

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.040 

so<00:01:15.880> if<00:01:16.060> there's<00:01:16.210> anybody<00:01:16.390> out<00:01:16.570> there<00:01:16.690> who<00:01:17.020> can

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
so if there's anybody out there who can

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.690 
so if there's anybody out there who can
help<00:01:17.290> me<00:01:17.470> I'd<00:01:17.590> really<00:01:17.770> appreciate<00:01:17.980> figuring

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
help me I'd really appreciate figuring

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.610 
help me I'd really appreciate figuring
out<00:01:18.790> what's<00:01:19.000> wrong<00:01:19.120> with<00:01:19.300> this<00:01:19.390> thing<00:01:19.630> maybe

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
out what's wrong with this thing maybe

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.380 
out what's wrong with this thing maybe
it's<00:01:20.830> just<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.130> its<00:01:21.280> way<00:01:21.430> out<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.640> that's<00:01:22.090> that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
it's just on its way out and that's that

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.860 
it's just on its way out and that's that
but<00:01:22.770> there's<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.860> way<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:23.979> fix<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.430> without<00:01:24.870> that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
but there's a way to fix it without that

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.330 
but there's a way to fix it without that
it<00:01:25.990> costing<00:01:26.350> more<00:01:26.500> than<00:01:26.560> buying<00:01:26.860> another<00:01:27.160> one

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
it costing more than buying another one

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
it costing more than buying another one
then<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.570> would<00:01:28.690> be<00:01:28.750> great

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.899 

and<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.830> doesn't<00:01:59.100> matter<00:01:59.250> which<00:01:59.400> input<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and it doesn't matter which input that I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.140 
and it doesn't matter which input that I
put<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.330> I'll<00:02:00.540> switch<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> efforts<00:02:05.150> that's

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
put it on I'll switch the efforts that's

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.010 
put it on I'll switch the efforts that's
the<00:02:06.330> DVD<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.190> pretty<00:02:08.670> much<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> same<00:02:12.200> PC

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
the DVD so it's pretty much the same PC

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.730 
the DVD so it's pretty much the same PC
and<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> regular<00:02:15.490> TV<00:02:15.880> which<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.740> coming

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and this is a regular TV which is coming

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.100 
and this is a regular TV which is coming
through<00:02:17.830> our<00:02:18.070> replay<00:02:18.640> TV<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.810> there's<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
through our replay TV but see there's a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.730 
through our replay TV but see there's a
picture<00:02:20.380> there<00:02:22.110> starting<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.200> materialize

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
picture there starting to materialize

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.680 
picture there starting to materialize
but<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.130> everyday<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.700> takes<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.090> little<00:02:25.300> bit

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
but it's everyday it takes a little bit

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.500 
but it's everyday it takes a little bit
longer<00:02:25.960> every<00:02:26.350> time<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:26.650> turn<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.070> TV<00:02:27.510> I'm

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
longer every time we turn on the TV I'm

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.820 
longer every time we turn on the TV I'm
thinking<00:02:28.840> well<00:02:28.960> maybe<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.320> just<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.710> leave

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
thinking well maybe we just got to leave

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.500 
thinking well maybe we just got to leave
it<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> time<00:02:30.490> now<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.970> thing<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.240> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
it on all the time now this thing is a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:03:00.140 
it on all the time now this thing is a
lot<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.750> power

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.850 

and<00:03:01.150> just<00:03:01.450> letting<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:02.020> play<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.650> long<00:03:02.800> as

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
and just letting it play for as long as

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.220 
and just letting it play for as long as
it<00:03:03.069> takes<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.460> for<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.480> picture<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.810> come<00:03:05.080> up

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
