00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.750 

also<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> stop<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.219> might<00:00:44.370> find<00:00:44.670> when

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
also when you stop you might find when

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.190 
also when you stop you might find when
you<00:00:44.910> stop<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> traffic<00:00:45.660> lights<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.020> wind

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
you stop the traffic lights the wind

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.420

sometimes<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.510> high<00:00:48.660> winds<00:00:48.899> I'll<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.230> both

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
sometimes in high winds I'll have both

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
sometimes in high winds I'll have both
feet<00:00:49.710> down<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> front<00:00:50.309> brake<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
feet down in the front brake on and that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
feet down in the front brake on and that
way<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> balance<00:00:52.410> either<00:00:52.890> way<00:00:53.010> depending

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
way I can balance either way depending

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.240 
way I can balance either way depending
where<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> winds<00:00:53.850> coming<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:55.100> also<00:00:56.100> watch

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
where the winds coming from also watch

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.180 
where the winds coming from also watch
out<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.610> things<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.149> open<00:00:57.539> junctions

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
out for things like these open junctions

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.500 
out for things like these open junctions
because<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> might<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.760> sheltered<00:01:00.210> around

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
because it might be sheltered around

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
because it might be sheltered around
these<00:01:00.690> buildings<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.739> over<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
these buildings when you get over like a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
these buildings when you get over like a
bridge<00:01:02.670> over<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> river<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> large

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
bridge over a river or or a large

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
bridge over a river or or a large
Junction<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> find<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Junction you're going to find that the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.390 
Junction you're going to find that the
wind<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.170> suddenly<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.710> stronger<00:01:08.189> just

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
wind will suddenly be stronger just

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
wind will suddenly be stronger just
there<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> lot<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.900> see

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
there so a lot there you go look you see

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
there so a lot there you go look you see
that<00:01:10.110> you've<00:01:11.010> got<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> allow<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.760> extra

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that you've got to allow for the extra

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.990 
that you've got to allow for the extra
gust<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.570> between<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.979> building's

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.080 

also<00:01:18.000> clothing-wise<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:20.310> you've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:20.939> any

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
also clothing-wise if you've got any

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.789 
also clothing-wise if you've got any

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
loose clothing on it is going to grab

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
loose clothing on it is going to grab
your<00:01:22.920> clothing<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.610> bit<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:23.970> you'll

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
your clothing a little bit more you'll

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.890 
your clothing a little bit more you'll
also<00:01:24.869> find<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:25.740> bikes<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.280> mine<00:01:26.900> that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
also find that some bikes like mine that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.109 
also find that some bikes like mine that
haven't<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.350> any<00:01:28.500> gaps<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.820> end<00:01:29.939> up

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
haven't got any gaps in them will end up

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
haven't got any gaps in them will end up
being<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.780> sheet<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:33.119> wind<00:01:33.360> will

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
being more like a sheet the wind will

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.060 
being more like a sheet the wind will
actually<00:01:33.900> take<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.170> more<00:01:34.500> than<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.950> these

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
actually take you more than one of these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
actually take you more than one of these
bikes<00:01:35.340> with<00:01:35.610> holes<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.930> bit

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bikes with holes in and you see that bit

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
bikes with holes in and you see that bit
of<00:01:37.170> debris<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.619> floor<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.159> there<00:01:38.340> that's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
of debris on the floor just there that's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.100 
of debris on the floor just there that's
just<00:01:38.610> blown<00:01:38.909> across<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> front

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.950 

so<00:01:44.800> just<00:01:45.220> keep<00:01:45.400> your<00:01:45.430> speed<00:01:45.700> down<00:01:45.970> anticipate
