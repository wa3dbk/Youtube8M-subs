00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.970
 I do not know 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.440
 but it's not right like that with what is the 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.940
 information beyond the Geneva auto 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.490
 and that has to do with an element of 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.810
 very interesting technology normally 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.960
 when we are on board a vehicle my 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.189
 Cristian son attraction friends 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.320
 we usually have to be adjusting 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.240
 not the rearview mirror to be able to have 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.130
 good visibility towards the part 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.320
 later on some occasions if 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.780
 people get a little big and 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.449
 robust we can start to have a little 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.320
 blocking in visibility in some 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.600
 moments 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.720
 that there is fogging the glass what if 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.129
 the blind spot we do not reach 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 calibrate with full 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.909
 we could have some kind of risk 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.979
 well the nissan brand will be presenting 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.900
 just the next web these days 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.019
 there is a new gin show 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.150
 mirror system rearview mirror 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.080
 rear-view mirror that will have two functions the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.820
 first is the rearview mirror 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.860
 conventional as we know it 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.330
 but with just pushing a button on 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.000
 the rearview mirror you are going to be able 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.310
 turn this mirror into a screen 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 lcd you will see that it will be connected 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.939
 directly with a camera that will be 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.619
 placed on the back and 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.020
 then you can go circulating 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.759
 frontal way and you can come 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.670
 You can go see what is happening 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.070
 behind you but with a high definition 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.679
 and in the same way when you need 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.000
 somehow this modify the 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.549
 visibility only with pressing a 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.920
 button you return to the conventional mode this 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.659
 it does not replace the camera at all 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 of rear view that the camera 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.069
 back view you will surely bring it 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.409
 placed as usual on the console 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.509
 central but this is simply a 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.979
 more benefit that will give you the have 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.929
 this technology in the rearview mirror 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.049
 and with this maintain a greater security 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.489
 now the nissan brand is not is not 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.530
 improvising in these moments with the 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:55.119
 camera technology you have to remember 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.209
 that for example when it launches path finder 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.909
 the spear with this monitoring system 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.670
 around the vehicle sight view of 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.079
 someone in which cameras placed in 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.989
 different points of the vehicle are 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.780
 four cameras allow a view 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.819
 360 degrees of the car and then it's like 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.410
 if you were watching what happens in 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.810
 your vehicle but it's the part from the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.129
 top so is the only thing then 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.079
 what is doing to the nissan brand is 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.299
 involving or incorporating new 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.650
 technologies in these systems I do not 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.720
 it attracts attention because 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.879
 it will make driving much safer 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.010
 with this possibility of maintaining a 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.720
 rear view through a screen 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.519
 from led or through your mirror 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.470
 conventional rearview we invite you to 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.459
 keep questioning the information with 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.459
 the following videos
