you know why I was originally miffed
that<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.280> cast<00:01:44.729> um<00:01:45.170> uh<00:01:46.549> Johnny<00:01:47.549> storms<00:01:48.090> dead

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that they cast um uh Johnny storms dead

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.350 
that they cast um uh Johnny storms dead
at<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.110> why<00:01:49.560> he's<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> scientist<00:01:50.939> running

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
at all why he's the scientist running

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
at all why he's the scientist running
the<00:01:51.509> experiment<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.200> he's<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> one

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the experiment right he's the one

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.830 
the experiment right he's the one
narrating<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> teaser<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.750> just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
narrating in the teaser and it's just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440 
narrating in the teaser and it's just
like<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.270> drawing

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
like I don't get it so if you're drawing

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.389 
like I don't get it so if you're drawing
this<00:01:57.659> big<00:01:57.869> experiment<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.159> where<00:01:59.310> it

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
this big experiment this is where it

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
this big experiment this is where it
makes<00:01:59.820> even<00:02:00.030> less<00:02:00.149> sense<00:02:00.329> again<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.619> just

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
makes even less sense again this is just

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.139 
makes even less sense again this is just
maybe<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.340> being<00:02:02.490> angry<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.030> with

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
maybe not being angry but this is with

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.719 
maybe not being angry but this is with
the<00:02:03.270> logic<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.740> why<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> casting

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the logic of it this is why you casting

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.130 
the logic of it this is why you casting
these<00:02:05.850> youngsters<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.810> they're<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.110> ones

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
these youngsters and they're the ones

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.749 
these youngsters and they're the ones
that<00:02:07.380> they're<00:02:07.770> sending<00:02:08.069> off<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.550> like

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that they're sending off on this like

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.010 
that they're sending off on this like
interdimensional<00:02:10.550> interdimensional<00:02:11.550> test

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
interdimensional interdimensional test

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.910 
interdimensional interdimensional test
they're<00:02:13.020> they're<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.470> 20

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
they're they're like 20

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.680 
they're they're like 20
five<00:02:14.040> years<00:02:14.280> old<00:02:14.550> these<00:02:15.150> would<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.450> something

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
five years old these would be something

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
five years old these would be something
that<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.170> 40<00:02:16.590> year<00:02:16.740> olds<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.069> do

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
that like 40 year olds would do

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.760 
that like 40 year olds would do
astronauts<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.270> 25<00:02:18.840> now<00:02:19.140> astronauts

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
astronauts for not 25 now astronauts

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.370 
astronauts for not 25 now astronauts
were<00:02:19.950> these<00:02:20.340> hardened<00:02:20.940> professional<00:02:21.380> pilots

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380

that<00:02:22.440> are<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> 30s<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.400> 40s<00:02:23.700> that

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that are like in the 30s and 40s that

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
that are like in the 30s and 40s that
word<00:02:24.300> have<00:02:24.720> been<00:02:24.840> doing<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.290> 20<00:02:25.620> years

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
even the fact that ok on its surface if

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.160 
even the fact that ok on its surface if
this<00:02:36.330> was<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.600> people<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> lot<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.080> people

saying well this wasn't called been
tested<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:39.000> probably<00:02:39.360> looked<00:02:39.569> pretty

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
tested for it probably looked pretty

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.449 
tested for it probably looked pretty
cool<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.350> would<00:02:40.739> agree<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.130> like
