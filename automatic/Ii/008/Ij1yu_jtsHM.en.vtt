 here alexandra smallpox Ã¡brego and them 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.620
 I wish to welcome another episode of 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.020
 alexandra tv I always wake up before 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.340
 let the sun rise in the morning if you have 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.860
 seen my video that a few 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.869
 I did months on how to get up 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.820
 early you know I wake up at 5 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.950
 in the morning and where I live at 5 in the morning 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.050
 tomorrow in the winter is still 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.270
 dark outside this morning when I 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.070
 I woke up I was looking outside I was 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.020
 still in my bed and is looking outside 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.780
 and it was all dark and I saw the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.730
 cars and the lights of the cars move to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.320
 one by one and I saw that there were some 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.970
 they were a bit more rushed than others 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.160
 sure they were coming after the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.040
 work and I was thinking I got to 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.450
 think when I was 18 if I did not 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.160
 they know my story and they have never 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.140
 heard about my story at 18 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 years I lived an apartment with a 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 friend 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 at that age I worked in a job that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 I hated hated this job because 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 it was not something that I liked to do was not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.200
 my passion and I had to work there 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.850
 because it was clear to pay the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.159
 invoices because at the end of the month I had to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
 pay electricity and rent and all 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 those things but I remember that all the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.000
 morning my 18 years and it was like 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.549
 for 2 years that I did that I had to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.710
 wake up like at 4 in the morning to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.960
 take a bus at 5 and a half of the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.970
 tomorrow to get to that job two 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.340
 hours later because it took two hours 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.800
 get there by bus and I remember 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 how much I hated that and I remember 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.940
 every morning when he left at 5 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.159
 something the morning and we're still curved and 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.960
 it was cold outside and I went into that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.330
 bus and all the people around me 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.360
 they were tired and they looked 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.830
 sad and they did not like it go where 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 they were going to work where they were 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.289
 unfortunately, many people live 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.299
 so he lives a life in which he does not live 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.970
 his passions in which he has to go to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.740
 a job that he simply hates for 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.899
 be able to pay bills at the end of the month 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 Many of us believe that we are 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.620
 free simply because 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.240
 in jail but really if from 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.280
 you really think about the life you're in 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.950
 living and you spend for example your week 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.380
 going to a place where you do not like to go is 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.790
 that you really are free the one that 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.160
 truth we are free I remember my 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.500
 18 years was not free was a person who 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.360
 I had to live that life to all 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.040
 days and I had no other choice because I knew 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.550
 that if I did not wake up to take out though 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.440
 I was tired because you were leaving me as they say 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.790
 in English my manager would vote for me 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.550
 I was going to have a job and I was not going to be able to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.230
 eat or pay my bills and this 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.870
 tomorrow when I was there made of my 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.930
 bed and looking outside I realized that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.660
 I am finally free I live a free life 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.090
 where what I do I love doing it 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.160
 where I live of my passion and I do not like 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.720
 use the word luck because I do not 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.990
 I believe in luck I believe that luck 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 it happens when the preparation finds 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.130
 the opportunity is there that one has 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.370
 lucky but I actually felt this 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.740
 tomorrow so lucky to live the life that 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.420
 I'm living and doing what I do and 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.950
 that I love and do what I do I gave 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.840
 mind that if this morning I wanted 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.930
 stay in my bed and sleep or a few 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.870
 how many more hours 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 to make it clear I did not do it because I love 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.750
 what I do and I want to wake up and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.090
 I want to go to work and film these 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.609
 videos for you but I realized 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.370
 I was lying but I could stay 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.989
 pitch had that option that freedom of 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.060
 choose what I want to do 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.370
 simply because there is no one above 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.409
 of me who is going to vote for me and who is going to 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.900
 Say you do not have a job anymore but something 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.180
 because I am my own you go as they say 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.040
 in English my own manager in 2002 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.920
 had created a program that was called 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.989
 the seven-week program in that 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.849
 program there was a course there were four 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.370
 different courses but one of them was 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.950
 how to start your own company was a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.810
 course for all the people who have 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.299
 and a company and they want to grow it 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.040
 or for people who still do not 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.799
 they have a company and maybe they have a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.569
 idea and they want to work on that idea and 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.719
 make the company grow 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.340
 and that course was a great success in 2012 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.769
 there were more than 100 people 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.230
 they signed up and many people started 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.109
 their companies and today they have very companies 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.680
 successful after the program seven 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.720
 weeks it became the academy 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
 and there exists in which there are four 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.530
 different courses on the four 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.139
 needs of the human being and the course 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.600
 on how to start throwing their own 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.610
 company like you forget it in 2012 and what 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.280
 I left behind but lately I've been 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.310
 thinking about that in freedom and what 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.020
 point to have your own company although yes 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.639
 it's a lot of work do not believe that because 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.800
 you have your own company you can do what 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.810
 that you want when you want if it is 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.400
 a lot of work and you're probably going 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.340
 to work more than the people who work 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.949
 for someone else then if it's work 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.320
 but when you love what you do when you 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.020
 what you do is your passion because you do not feel 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.360
 that is work and that really is the 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.970
 freedom the freedom of every day 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.150
 do something you love and that's what 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.560
 I want to give you then this 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.840

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.000
 decided to re-launch my program 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.590
 for entrepreneurs for people 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.240
 that maybe they already have a company and 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.699
 they want to make it grow they want to earn more 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.130
