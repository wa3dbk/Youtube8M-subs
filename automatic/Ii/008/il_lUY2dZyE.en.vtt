00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.920
 So doing something should change 31 days of water at least eleven days 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.100
 more than average 1 to enter the time yet a lot of board 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.889
 arrived 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.740

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.010
 Premium money sign it on 30 we want with 13 7 meters

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.149
 the good piece 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.220
 I still had luck EUR 81 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.399
 tasted 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.329

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.490
 Bad luck 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.629
 I have to say, though 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.019
 May 83 were also a bit lucky because stocks were there 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:41.920
 hold you 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.770
 can cultivate very fast on the web during working hours and therefore 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.550
 is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.260
 nothing to say 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.290
 I think what it might look like 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.700
 in the video all this does not sound very well-made "at all 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.800
 nothing to complain about Â»this is Barber Band as such works flawlessly 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 Concept of a production error 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690
 the plastic is very popular 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.170
 As he calls for help, there is also a worldwide trend 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.980
 the run 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.880
 this part the 13 centimeter diameter variant I've got Marie Vell 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.900
 Description unfortunately missing now 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.340
 can you give it yes has really ADSL and I say so 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.310
 If you think he played Dufry that fast, then you have a lot of fun 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.500
 So I'm still at 11 78 now 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.650
 It's fair to start again from the beginning so that there is 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.680
 but possibly also predictable 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.590
 Dr you have to play the whole really three-dimensional why on 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.800
 this level 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.640
 but you want it so optimally 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.160

 you have to drop it sometimes two inches Google 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 this is really not a safe matter anymore 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 well I think I think that's not synonymous to say 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.729
 who or what you are looking for 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:18.029
