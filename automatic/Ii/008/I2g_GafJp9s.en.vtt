00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.560 
you're going to think it's a little
rough<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> does<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> job<00:01:41.909> done<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
rough but it does get the job done and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.700 
rough but it does get the job done and
it's<00:01:42.750> absolutely<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.439> hundred<00:01:43.470> percent

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it's absolutely one hundred percent

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.139 
it's absolutely one hundred percent
better<00:01:43.950> than<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.490> sponge<00:01:44.880> tip<00:01:45.090> applicator

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
better than any sponge tip applicator

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999 
better than any sponge tip applicator
that<00:01:45.630> comes<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.049> anything<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.530> elf<00:01:46.770> gives

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that comes with anything that elf gives

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.460 
that comes with anything that elf gives
you<00:01:47.479> because<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:48.600> stopped<00:01:48.869> giving<00:01:49.049> brushes

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you because they stopped giving brushes

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
you because they stopped giving brushes
in<00:01:49.680> their<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.490> books<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.329> started

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
in their little books they started

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.179 
in their little books they started
giving<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> sponge<00:01:52.079> tip<00:01:52.200> applicator<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.770> no

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
giving the sponge tip applicator or no

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.499 
giving the sponge tip applicator or no
applicator<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.329> really

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
applicator at all so this is really

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.789 
applicator at all so this is really
great<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> pick<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.409> need<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> brush

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
great to pick up if you need a brush

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
great to pick up if you need a brush

powder<00:01:58.170> brush<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.590> horrible<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
powder brush to be horrible it's really

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.420 
powder brush to be horrible it's really
really<00:02:00.119> small<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.950> what<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
really small I don't know what kind of

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.010 
really small I don't know what kind of
powder<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.939> expect<00:02:03.270> us<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> apply<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:03.899> this

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
powder they expect us to apply with this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.569 
powder they expect us to apply with this
because<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.409> already<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.100> blush<00:02:05.310> brush

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579

in<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.869> terms<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> foundation<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.190> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
in here in terms of foundation this is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
in here in terms of foundation this is
quite<00:02:08.610> small<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.239> guess<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.929> good

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
quite small I guess this would be good

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.770 
quite small I guess this would be good
for<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.590> guess<00:02:10.800> slight<00:02:11.099> bronzing<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:12.330> um<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
for I guess slight bronzing but um it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.210 
for I guess slight bronzing but um it
just<00:02:13.020> doesn't

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
just doesn't

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.140 
just doesn't
it's<00:02:14.580> very<00:02:14.790> rough<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.480> not<00:02:15.690> smooth<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150

it's very rough it's not smooth I I
personally<00:02:18.150> did<00:02:18.390> not<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.440> powder<00:02:19.770> brush

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
