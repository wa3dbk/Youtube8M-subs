00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.260
 currants 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.840
 I tried this recipe that year 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.930
 I found him on the Internet and he did not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 came up for me is very important to cook 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.129
 fast and tasty 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 it is prepared to be stored very quickly 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.160
 long 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.129
 you can use this jam everywhere and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.260
 even with a cup of fragrant winter tea 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.379
 in the evening it's just a fairy tale 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.960
 and enjoying the flavors of the summer so 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.250
 let's start I have two kilograms 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 black currant 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 as you can see from the photo there falls white 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.850
 currant 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.820
 but you can like me mix or with white 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.600
 or red but black currant should 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.299
 to prevail 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.390
 if you don't want to mix then 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.360
 take only black because black 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.729
 currant has excellent gelling 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 no gelatinous properties on 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.790
 we will not need to add on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.880
 two kilograms of currants 1 liter of water and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.830
 two and a half kilograms of sugar 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200
 these proportions jen is not obtained 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.320
 too sweet with a little sourness 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.710
 to my taste it is itself passing by 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 ways if you don't like and like 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.520
 sweeter jam then take this 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.320
 amount of currant 3 kilograms of sugar 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.480
 pour our currants one by one 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.510
 liter of clean drinking water and put on 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.330
 bring the fire to a boil and keep on 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.300
 fire for 10 minutes and turn off the gas 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.390
 and leave for a while so that our berries 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.150
 lightly started and became soft topics 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.710
 time preparing our jars for these 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.980
 proportions it took me four 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 1 half-liter jars 3 to 700 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.300
 milliliters and one small container 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.410
 300 milliliters coming 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.200
 I sterilized the use of the jar 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.050
 for 15 minutes every necessary 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.210
 for good storage since I store 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.340
 it's jim in the fridge and our jars 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.860
 closed with plastic caps 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.960
 if you keep conservation in the cellar 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.610

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.280
 jars in the usual way with 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.860
 metal covers further took 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.350
 a large pot and poured into it two with 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.260
 half a kilo of sugar and there too 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.710
 through a sieve poured the resulting juice from 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.190
 berries 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.450
 berries laid in a separate bowl and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.810
 ground into a homogeneous mass submersible 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.330
 blender it came out very quickly and 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.100
 to a uniform consistency if you 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.010
 no blender you can use 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.940
 grinder skip the berry through it 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.470
 or rub through a large sieve 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.739
 then send our berry puree in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.890
