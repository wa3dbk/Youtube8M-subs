locked<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.320> launch<00:01:01.739> pad<00:01:02.100> app<00:01:02.930> okay<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.430> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
locked to launch pad app okay so you can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.940 
locked to launch pad app okay so you can
do<00:01:08.729> multi<00:01:09.119> task<00:01:09.869> sweeping<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
do multi task sweeping with this but I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.530 
do multi task sweeping with this but I
don't<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.400> multi<00:01:11.729> testing<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.360> let's

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
don't have multi testing and so let's

00:01:12.540 --> 00:03:15.930 
don't have multi testing and so let's
just<00:01:12.600> start<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> up

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.210 

okay<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.000> now<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:17.660> we<00:03:17.830> adjust<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.490> tempo<00:03:20.000> let's

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
okay so now if we adjust the tempo let's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.290 
okay so now if we adjust the tempo let's
let's<00:03:22.220> take<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.430> look<00:03:22.610> really<00:03:22.850> fast<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:23.270> can

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
let's take a look really fast so we can

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.740 
let's take a look really fast so we can
hear<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.690> difference<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.260> should<00:03:24.470> be

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
hear it difference so we should be

00:03:25.750 --> 00:04:17.960 
hear it difference so we should be
hopefully<00:03:26.950> synced

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:41.990 

I<00:04:31.340> ain't<00:04:32.340> Sinkin<00:04:38.780> see<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.990> we<00:04:40.110> can't<00:04:41.000> we've
