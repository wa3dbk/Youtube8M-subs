00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.770
 that was the premiere yesterday 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.000
 Wednesday has the FC Inter pushing its 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.220
 recorded operation 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.820
 the two ligature competitors tsv 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:45.739
 lindewitt and fc inter dragon met in the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.829
 Circular on one actually existed 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.050
 opponent in this partie three because 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.570
 both teams had additional 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.460
 Still fighting against the weather always 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.460
 big and big again 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 About 100 spectators left 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.670
 but do not be put off 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.420
 quickly you noticed the two teams 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
 that she is still in the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.770
 preparation phase 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.050
 the on both sides were missing important 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.159
 players who are still in the earned 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.940
 sommerurlaub were 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:26.510
 Let's first take the result 1 to 2 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.369
 for the kites only that 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.860
 sounds at first glance after one 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.500
 short result and a broad one 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.810
 balanced game but in fact 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.659
 was at least in the first half of the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.520
 fc behind push the clearly dominant 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.350
 team 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.110
 already in the fifth minute could 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.530
 daniel alexander pushes the only to 1 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.530
 to lead 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.200
 who made it three minutes before 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.780
 break for another hit 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 Unfortunately we can not give you this gate 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.260
 demonstrate 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.060
 the rain has ours in between 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 put technology out of action 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.500
 in the second half came the tsv 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.390
 lindewitt with his young team 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.390
 much better in the game 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 the fc interlaken took the tempo out 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.830
 and tried the game too 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.830
 check 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.510
 a carelessness in the 62 minute 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.420
 had consequences 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.650
 Raphael GÃ¤rtig justifiably received the red 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.790
 card and had to leave the place 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.950
 at the same time, the prudent showed 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.640
 Referee team on the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.640
 elfmeter point 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:10.110
 Well, when guests turned the penalty 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.110
 and thus achieved the 1 2 endstand 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.200
 seven yellow cards as in lindewitt and 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.840
 3 against the dragons are a clearer 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.260
 evidence of the militant use of 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.260
 teams 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.450
 you can be curious as the two 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:42.720
 Coach the point game in august 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:43.229
 to tackle tactically today 2 2 1 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.320
 won 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.780
 how was the game yes we think so 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.030
 Starting well is not easy 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.530
 if you do not know where you stand it was 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.280
 first obligation game what we had today 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.510
 before that just a preparatory game 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.919
 and that's why we started well 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.620
 because one has already noticed that the 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.530
 strength has waned after a good one 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.930
 Of course, the weather is still the hour 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.030
 not so easy not the ball 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.500
 to play and as you already noticed 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.150
 that we have not been together so often 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.110
 have played and that the forces 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.610
 have subsided 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.470
 but by and large we have 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.539
 have been good in the back 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.600
 played in the first half that 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.979
 It was quite neat 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.470
 There are supposed to in between but some 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.240
 the yellow cards were distributed 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.460
 was not justified 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.900
 friendship game but cup and 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.180
 think that was all still on the 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.010
 normal level that happens and if you do 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.690
 leads and the opponent plays at home 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.450
 they want to beat us inter dragon 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.460
 yet nobody knows here as on the space 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.940
 how to play by and that the 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.300
 Of course winning is clear and that 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.669
 then of course you fight that too 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.740
 is also normal and therefore is not 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.020
 hard game was such a situation even 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.430
 nation is okay so on the whole 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.880
 are you happy with the 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.729
 power 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.860
 yes we know that we still have a lot to do 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.789
 have to 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.949
 conditional or whatever is there 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.419
 still many construction sites but until they have 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.979
 we are on a good way and we are 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.809
 must continue to work hard to be the 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.399
 We do the week and next week 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:16.289
 and so on and then the 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:20.059
 we are looking forward to it 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:20.059
 then you can right now
