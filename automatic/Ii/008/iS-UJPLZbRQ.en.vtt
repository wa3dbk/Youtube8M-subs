00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.900
 breast cancer is an extremely frequent disease the world 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.210
 western 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.370
 today 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.729
 it is said that one in eight women 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.239
 has had to attend to a breast cancer 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.409
 this gives us the magnitude of this disease and the repercussion 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.449
 that has at the level of women and public health 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.919
 women who are most at risk 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.699
 risk factors for having breast cancer 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.839
 they are first that in age 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.490
 70% 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.649
 of tumors of breast cancers 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.700
 occurs in women over 50 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.420
 the second element is the background 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 relatives 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.840
 of breast cancer in both the first degree family director 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.280
 that is mother sister or daughter 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.900
 the third element of irrigation 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.880
 is one that has suffered breast cancer killa from a breast cancer 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.710
 in one of your breasts 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.730
 have a lot of chances to win it in another 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.720
 and those women who have received some type of violence and who have 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.129
 some histological element of illness in his mom 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.430
 kiir commenting 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.260
 seeing the possibility 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.510
 having 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.350
 e this one 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.980
 this sickness 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.690
 the most important thing is early diagnosis 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.430
 mirotic to the disease of its initial stages 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.110
 when it is still not palpable when the woman 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.220
 still does not have any symptoms 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.160
 and in this way we resort to element 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.550
 image diagnosis is that love like that 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.420
 zamora fÃ­a 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.520
 it's a simple study that in 20 30 minutes 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.890
 is done 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.020
 does not need any previous preparation 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.130
 and there is no new information diagnostic elements 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.890
 in early stages 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 of this disease 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.230
 when we associate it with ultrasound 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.130
 and other studies such as resonance 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.500
 good we mention the possibility of acoustics cancer its stadiums 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.760
 there is an old element that also does not have to be discarded 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.780
 what is said of the breast self-examination 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.440
 The artisanal woman exam is performed 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.409
 herself every month after the explosion 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.079
 and when they find a different different element with which to concur 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.750
 at your doctor's office 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.929
 so that this one 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.109
 percent and chairs and it's the right time to perform some kind of 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.219
 study 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.219
 we must emphasize that mammography together with ultrasound 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.519
 it is an element 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.969
 I imagine logical 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.229
 of diagnosis when the disease returns to reiterate what 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.229
 has not yet given any kind of manifestation 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.199
 this has numerous advantages 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.819
 The first one is that 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.579
 If this patient, this woman needs surgery 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.969
 surely the animal will not consent to use that the woman does not talk about her 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.959
 mom 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.959
 and that generally you will not have to receive treatments 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.979
 Saturday parliament hard as in the front line 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.949
 that is to say that maybe with a simple surgery 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.479
 associated with a radiant treatment 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.119
 and some treatment with some medication 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.210
 came as aggressive as chemotherapy 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.099
 out on your problem 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.229
 that's why we stressed that every woman 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:16.009
 for 100 between 25 and 40 years old he had to have his first love affirmed 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.859
 shamam basic prayer 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.760
 and after 40 years 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.809
 the recommendations in national and international 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:27.189
 they talk about a mammogram every year or every two years 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.449
 being eta of much more 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.449
 performance after 50 years because of what we said previously 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:38.909
 that 70% of breast cancer occurs in older women in the pool 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.759
 of the 50's 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.459
 between the diagnostic elements 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.099
 that we have today 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.399
 to which we have to add 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:51.689
 that when someone sees a suspicious image on mammography grandma 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.669
 ultrasound 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.969
 one can realize an airplane be warned of this injury of this manifestation 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.399
 radiological 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.269
 It is intensity d 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.610
 and hospitalization 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.639
 without needs that are generated 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.219
 on an outpatient basis 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.729
 with local anesthesia 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.819
 through a small abuja where a car makeup by the ultrasound machine 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.119
 guided by the mammographer 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.820
 took a small sample 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.979
 that then the pathologist in analyzing here will tell us if this is 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.430
 a malignant tumor or is it a lyme disease 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.670
 that you are a mammogram a new office of ethics some injury 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.779
 there is no alteration in the radiological study 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:35.389
 there are elements of study that in the relatively simple entity 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.440
 and that can give us the diagnosis 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.430
 with precision 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.430
 nowadays I must name the first place 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.200
 that has been more than 20 years 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.700
 of the block before sleep or partial mastectomy or lumpectomy 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.759
 that is to say 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.039
 the surgery have been carried out without need 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.969
 must take out the whole breast 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.110
 in the one that you have to do what you have to take out the mom I hear and tarimoro 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.419
 there was the possibility of conserving the skin, that is, the coverage of the breast 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.020
 only the big doubt 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.180
 leave the skin that makes some time of reconstruction 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.120
 that you may want cortical prosthesis or with women's own tissue 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.779
 d can take the skin and muscle of the lower abdomen 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.270
 one understands the back 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.139
 in this way one can 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.080
 percent went into a woman to the operating room with a breast cancer that 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.469
 it is that this gave details to finish the whole breast can be reconstructed in 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.170
 Immediate form freedom not only trying 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.710
 his malignant tumor but also he is giving back to the woman a fun 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.689
 new mom 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:40.660
 so that when you leave the operating room 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.909
 knew the closest thing to what it was before entering 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.539
 another of the advances that in recent years 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.830
 in what is called the sentinel ganglion 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.190
 breast tumors first send the cells towards the armpit towards 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:54.009
 the neighborhoods 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.020
 the murder we have a numerous number of years 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.100
 but some 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.689
 that is called have to feel on the island will be encouraged the density 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.050
 where are the first to go? 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.580
 if you take from galileo 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.610
 it is analyzed from 9 bilbao operation and the pathologist from a similar 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.080
 if there are no malignant hybrid cells 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.650
 Yes last year 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.469
 she is sick I do not need more in intensity I like to make more changes 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:19.589
 with the advantages and benefits 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.080
 that today can not give here 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.770
 minor surgery 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.789
 without the islands the complications 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.669
 inherent in a depletion that is that what happened will be cleansed sensitivity 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.919
 today have modifications in mobility 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.310
 I believe that in summary 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.129
 these are the advances 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.520
 and there the last years referred to surgery 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.180
 that the surgery in less with much reason of the breast hopefully that 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.529
 you have to take out the reconstruction mom 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:49.059
 we also remember that not only can reconstruction be immediate 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.770
 but that woman that she has had 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.639
 an amputation of your breast 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.480
 it can also be rebuilt 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.789
 I repeat again with prostheses or with own tissues organism 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.809
 these officials in general 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:05.079
 are the great advances that have been in surgery 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:06.689
 breast cancer
