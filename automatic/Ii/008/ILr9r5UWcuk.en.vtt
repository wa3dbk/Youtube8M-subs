00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:09.450
 so good day to all small 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.929
 block repair video report 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:20.990
 climate control to date 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.990
 climate control unit worked inadequately 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 then add added speed 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.359
 The fan happened to refuse at all 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.359
 wanted to work 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.180
 work done as follows 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:51.699
 at first took just such a panel she just 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 snaps on and and then pulled out the block itself 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:59.199
 climate control rests on these 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.510
 hex bolted 2 here they stand here 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.259
 here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 hex on 4 in my 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.460
 given 4 unscrewed these bolts 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.020
 the next thing i shot is this one 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.950
 monitorchik in this thing I do not heal 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.160
 I will it and the outside he keeps 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.990
 on 3 bolts as we see from the inside 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:35.310
 parties, that is, from here it will be 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:41.970
 probably seen here it is one hole 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 the second and the bottom 3 unscrew them unscrewed 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:53.560
 disconnected this loop 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:56.770
 appreciated the train further here such here 8 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 fixers here they are 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:06.460
 they just twist and this one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:12.190
 the screen is shot here out under which 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.269
 there are connectors from this loop on 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.799
 I saw four of them 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:23.019
 microcracks which disappeared 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.910
 I can tell you a soldering iron can be thin because 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.620
 that the contacts are very close 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:39.750
 each other and so I demonstrate that we 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:42.750
 turned out added 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.750
 appears 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.970
 way down 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.739
 everything is working 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.870
 specially 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.870
 but 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.350
 my assembly accordingly produce in 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:19.170
 reverse order we put the cover 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:24.140
 fasten everything in place are you not happy 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.140
 forget to wipe the dust all thanks
