00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.780
 well, then we are going to place the 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.740
 pretty remote flash as far away 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 possible because you see for that area a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.410
 the wall to see what it is like 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.130
 flash and good to see how much it covers 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.509
 Well, in principle we put them 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.509
 at the minimum power 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.850
 and now where I put the camera 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:45.659
 well now we configure 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:45.659
 the camera because in principle we go there 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.630
 this first shot with flash and the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.630
 study let's shoot that area 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.910
 yes 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.110
 wow super good there you have the photo in 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.590
 screen 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.380
 Miguel 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.380
 ok let's increase 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.690
 one step 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 of authentic 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.920
 it shows the passage of power is another note 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.920
 little step more 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.690
 it's amazing piece of power another 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.690
 more step 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.689
 to her a lot of conscience but good 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.689
 let's keep going up to see what happens 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.040
 ah 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.050
 well this already white total we're almost going to 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:00.210
 activate the sound 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:03.180
 sorry the sound this is the here it's worth 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.030
 and we went up another step for that truth 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.030
 so we can see what to recycle 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.140
 when it makes the sound is that it is already 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.980
 ready to fire again we had 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.980
 another step more 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.330
 and finally 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.080
 at maximum power 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.080
 to see how 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.680
 well, really well, the truth 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:50.360
 that is, using only one power step and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.360
 I liked how it came out we're going to see it like that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.140
 effectively if an elimination arrives 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.650
 quite correct fixes we are giving 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.470
 only 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.750
 it is a minimum power 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.310
 let's put an umbrella for 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.310
 see how it diffuses light 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.930
 to see what effect 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.930
 you disappoint cause in the drop 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.060
 well they say that the umbrella opens 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.500
 inside the house brings bad luck 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.370
 the photographers then we have to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.370
 have unbelievable bad luck 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.489
 then we have placed in the umbrella 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.740
 I will put more or less exactly 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.040
 just where I was before 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.180
 and let's start 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.010
 then that at the minimum power of the flash 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.010
 first we make a test shot 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.820
 and I'm going to take you inside the frame 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.820
 ticos 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.150
 there is a difference and there is a lot 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.680
 difference comes out a lot more 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.000
 blurred the most distributed light 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.000
 another power step 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.770
 acs I like how it comes from boosting the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.460
 light this created 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.460
 three steps 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.180
 well we get a uniformity 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.710
 quite general there is everything very 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.280
 evenly lit pretty well 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 I like with three steps of power this 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.970
 is perfectly lit fixes that 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.970
 this habituation right now is 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.830
 practically very dim of light there is a 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.289
 pair of lights there understood very dim 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:54.149
 very soft let's put 1234 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.149
 we are in the fourth step of power 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.560
 yes yes it shows that I like it because 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.590
 he is noticing he is not noticing 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.380
 blatantly the power the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.370
 luminosity is noticing 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.310
 progressively and I like that because 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.820
 it means more control 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.620
 another little step 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.070
 let's make it a little different from a 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.740
 picture although good let's leave it as 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.780
 it was very good here we are noticing the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.780
 power another step more 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.320
 super diffuse I'm thinking this to 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.900
 mode of when we are already in a fund and 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.260
 all neutral that we do that to be 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.449
 some 83- centimeter umbrellas that are 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.699
 in diameter these are the little ones the 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.350
 true that it expands and diffuses 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.350
 pretty good we're going to see there 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.870
 here we have more power 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.100
 last step 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.100
 and maximum power 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.820
 good 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.220
 perfect 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.910
 very well we are going to lower it in through to 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.980
 minimum 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.540
 good good good good it's all 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.820
 it looks pretty good you things 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.920
 two new guys here and we're going to leave 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.100
 the video for today we have been testing 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:26.570
 the studio flash and now that I'm 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.640
 quite happy I think to begin with 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.550
 I think it's a flash are the flashes that 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.660
 they're pretty good and 330 watts the 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.770
 truth that is power more than enough 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.740
 Remember that good because unless 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.330
 have a theme of power is 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.170
 quite important the flashes to I do not know 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.840
 so you have a huge room 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.450
 very very very large a very large room 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.160
 you are not going to need more power than 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:57.770
 these 300 even I even think 250 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.930
 watts for a flash is pretty good 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.750
 I think we're going to be able to do a lot 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.340
 interesting things with them and nothing and 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.620
 little by little, you will be able to see it 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.810
 here in the arrived photo situation 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.570
 let's just say that a first shot 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.760
 of a test contact with the phrases 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.720
 that we will be doing things more seriously 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.550
 Y 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.650
 and I hope you liked guys 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.750
 leaving our like if you liked it and 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.310
 if nothing happens and a comment if 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.100
 you want too and see you in the 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.000
 next chapter here in the draw pictures 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.000
 see you later
