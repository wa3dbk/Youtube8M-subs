 aircraft in the hangars of 6th the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.560
 Argentine airline owner Mariano 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.070
 recalled after a balance the actions of 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.240
 the company in this 2011 that ends 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.679
 It was a very hard year for all the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.899
 commercial industry have gone bankrupt 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.600
 other companies have had to do 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.399
 Strong adjustments many airlines 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.350
 we have had problems as well 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.179
 for we say that the catastrophe that all 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 Argentines suffer with the rash 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.979
 of a volcano that continues in the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.179
 activity after more than six months and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.009
 despite all that airlines 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.330
 argentinas kept flying followed 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.299
 growing continues to incorporate aircraft 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.220
 continued adding passengers and that's why 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.890
 we say that having survived 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.690
 this storm have passed this test and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.009
 have continued flying and with 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.009
 projection makes us very happy
