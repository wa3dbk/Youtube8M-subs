00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.939
 these guys are I am alan aguilar and 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.420
 we are now seeing this model of 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.769
 caterpillar coulant this is a boot 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.760
 for work in the cen and vote for 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.210
 work 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.619
 composed of steel tip that we're going to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.630
 indicate one more time the chapel 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.220
 It is completely made in leather not 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.820
 mouth yellow or young child color honey 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.820
 then in the chapel 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.810
 and this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.170
 and has some touches of brown especially 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.550
 at the top as you can 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.989
 appreciate here this part of the part 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 superior is composed of this fiber 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.760
 but synthetic leather type is very good 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 Bedspread gives comfort and in charge of canvas 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.890
 small 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.410
 same in the external lateral part as 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.970
 you see we are going to see the internal forum that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.940
 It is composed of this textile material 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.850
 it is brown 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.829
 and has riveted on the inside and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.719
 I took the template here too 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.580
 so that we give him to create a 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.340
 revised inverted 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.650
 thin if with in the part of it has 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.119
 a diego insert for general extra 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.790
 comfort when walking some perforations 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.909
 for transpiration generate a template 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.509
 basic 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.439
 but with the shoe in the part of the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.920
 upper part of the tongue is 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.560
 composed of this material that we 're going 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.079
 yellow color with your logo 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.090
 embroidered caterpillar and the middle part of 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.780
 the tongue if this one is made of this 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 brown canvas 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.260
 I 'm not mail in the cut 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.770
 to some specifications if we go 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.760
 first with the steel tip now the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.760
 steel tip is 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.729
 made to withstand 2,500 pounds of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.640
 pressure before breaking this is more or 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.909
 less about one thousand 134 kilos is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.729
 say it exceeds the ton ok 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.159
 well this certified by the stm that is 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.270
 the america society of testing and 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.039
 materials that is an organization 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.039
 international standardization 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.180
 and also serves for the protection of 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.180
 everyone 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.800
 another indication the sole that is a the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.320
 srx with rx technologies as you see this 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.780
 It is an extra extra sole resistant to 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.480
 I slip in dry conditions and in 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.360
 wet conditions correct 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.670
 in addition it also has a sole has cuts 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.390
 polite for flexion though as seen 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.069
 flex area or flex zone is for 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.249
 that these cuts the big cuts 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.909
 reflection we indicate that this type of 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:51.209
 shoes is excellent and tough for 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.299
 the oil is 600 chemicals as well 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.359
 also resistant to heat water 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.280
 also generally when you put a 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.900
 shoe with leaving a shoe with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.900
 in exhibition that usually does not take off 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.870
 in time and it is necessary to say it but 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.660
 good abrasion resistant is a 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.730
 very resistant area and very well elaborated 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.080
 well we had not noticed that these 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.550
 shoes had between sole of eva but 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.530
 in this case this is not a sole diet 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.540
 Polyurethane is a different material 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.260
 a bit in this case in this density a 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.570
 bit harder if you give it a little more like 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.240
 I am like but this one here is much more is 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.870
 as fully as light elevates 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.150
 hardest group 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.840
 for what reason 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.840
 good 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.800
 I think it must be because it also has 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.290
 the advantage of having 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.890
 resistance to good electrical risk 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.910
 this protects the user against 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.440
 following current is not in 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.650
 contact with the current this supports 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.680
 18 thousand volts at 60 hertz during a 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.710
 minute in dry conditions this is a 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.780
 drop resistant to electricity or to 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.310
 electrical risk towards guys these are 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.750
 the caterpillar tails 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.750
 how can oppression 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.209
 and that 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.910
 let's go one more lap 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.960
 the pins are also round like 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.490
 it is appreciated we go on the bottom and this 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.520
 this one did not have I want the green of 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.460
 the label to see if it is appreciated to stm 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.670
 that already indicates the American society 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.240
 of testing and materials 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.699
 Y 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.360
 the number of standards efe 24 13 and 11 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:48.550
 Right 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:51.490
 and 75 and 65 the good of 1,075 against 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.550
 impact and the 75 is will put the compression 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.580
 both resistant and the electric dh are 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.870
 here is the electrical risk not the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.699
 guys from the reviewed available already 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.039
 has the sport point computation p from 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.409
 size 40 which is 7 in caterpillar 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.409
 up to the size of 10 which is 43
