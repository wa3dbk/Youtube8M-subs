00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 you will need a little time 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.030
 tooth bells clip a group and to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.330
 give a special touch and differentiate this 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.099
 hairstyle a tiara I already showed in 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 another video how to do a hairstyle 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.390
 similar to this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 in various places 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.220
 To start, I'm going to untangle my 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.150
 hair so I tried the well shot everyone 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.329
 the newborns with care when pulling 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.329
 wires 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.470
 now I'm going to split my hair in half 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.470
 with the tooth itself even due 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.840
 Now I'm going to put the tiara on my 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.960
 head just to see where she's staying and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 Where I'm going to do that one part 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.110
 more up then I put on the tiara and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.600
 back there I start pulling my hair there 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.729
 will stay a move snow will stay 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.580
 how can I say 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.330
 in the high pet because it is a little behind 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.530
 but it will stay high then you with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.780
 yourself try you 're pulling a handle 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.530
 good amount of hair but no stick 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.750
 a very thick amount is now I 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.909
 shot my tiara straightens the fringe and there 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.030
 O give you more or less to see 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.770
 amount of hair I got 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.369
 glad I'm going to split this fuse into 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.369
 I put two're there to help me comb 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.759
 I separate 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.360
 play the first part because 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.660
 she will cover and finish and in this 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.090
 The second part that stayed I'm going to divert the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.880
 I worked well with my own tooth 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.730
 to give volume 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.070
 to be well, my dear princess 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.980

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.480
 hand 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.450
 I'll spend a bit of if shampoo to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.730
 dry because I do not want to use only spray 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:38.720
 to give it more movement and leave this 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.430
 Mouse nest is not very cute 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.380
 so I apply the shampoo he goes the hair 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.540
 from above that I'm bringing back 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.390
 now it will cover so it will not show up 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.220
 white then gently or pulling 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.370
 that first part that we played 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.910
 For the front I'm pulling back to 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.580
 cover what we said okay I 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.350
 tightening a twisted one the more 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.840
 you play forward 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.860

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.959
 tuft 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.570
 then only learn with grampinho 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.739
 straighten the tail behind the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.230
 hair is almost ready if a 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.540
 side gets taller than the other you give 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.270
 a raise even with the tip of the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.890
