00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi friends from youtube I hope you are 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 great today after a long time 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.300
 I bring a tutorial so that everyone can 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.900
 play one of my favorite games 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.299
 Lordships for play 1 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.490
 first they go to the description and they 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.890
 download the two discs and the emulator the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:26.450
 which I have uploaded to mega 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.450
 [Music] 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.260
 once downloaded we start extracting 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.260
 the emulator 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.140
 is the final ps x although there are others this 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.180
 be far the most stable 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 [Music] 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.580
 now we extract the two discs each 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.410
 comes with the image of the disc and a 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.300
 sub file which bring the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.430
 subtitles of the game since it is in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 English in text and japan- is native 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.290
 where those two files put them 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.840
 they must go together 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.840
 [Music] 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.720
 Now although this is not necessary, 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.970
 I recommend for comfort and not 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.680
 leave everything watered move the four 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.660
 files the two discs and the two 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.460
 subtitles to the folder within the 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.940
 emulator folder called access 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.940
 images 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.280
 [Music] 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 that's what all emulators and roms have in a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.330
 only site 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:44.550
 [Music] 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.170
 well now we open the emulator and 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:55.720
 we are going to configure 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.640
 [Music] 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 do what I do well they do not have 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.370
 problems when saving the game or with 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:10.759
 lips and you will come to ask 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.759
 [Music] 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.220
 the god file comes within the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.800
 bios folder that is within the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:28.470
 emulator that simple 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.470
 [Music] 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.520
 and they also give the folder that 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590
 call memories and even if I do not put this 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.320
 nothing inside give you to open and the emulator 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.590
 he creates a memory link and 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.249
 automatically 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.249
 [Music] 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 you can also configure the graphics 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.970
 to be seen in a panoramic way or in 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.760
 full screen that is with soul ' 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.750
 center apply and accept and we are already 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.750
 ready to play 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.850
 it gives you I did not think of image and look for the 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.670
 folder where they have the game obviously 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.390
 they open the disc 1 and once they pass 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.670
 this disc already open the second 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.459
 [Music] 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.260
 As you can see, he is ready to play and he is 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.180
 in all subtitles to Spanish even 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:37.940
 the kinematics 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:40.520
 [Music] 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.770
 and they can also connect joysticks and they 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.450
 accommodates them or configure the keyboard to 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.550
 make it easier to use since 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.850
 we will have to use all the buttons of the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:56.430
 I send 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:56.430
 [Music] 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.700
 and they do not have to touch anything else anymore 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.190
 just enjoy but good this emulator 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.620
 bring two books with this game the first 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.080
 is that by taking a certain item the game is 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.880
 freeze when you enter inventory like this 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.370
 that it would always be good to keep 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.019
 twice in different boxes so if 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.060
 you get them from women they will have the 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.130
 backing and they will know more or less which item 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.080
 cause them the error in my case was the 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.060
 crystal crown but I have seen that no 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.860
 it's always the same item so now 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.990
 know and the second bourgeois that at 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.790
 face for the first time with deus in 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.890
 the second disk since it stays 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.900
 unloading his fifth infinitely 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.360
 attack I think remember the solution is 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.490
 kill him as soon as possible so if 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.740
 they want they can look at a guide or something that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.530
 this is a box puzzle has its mana for 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.600
 kill him without further hope I enjoy this 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.760
 wonder of game do not forget about 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.560
 comment give thumb and all that advise if 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.580
 the game or the emulator is dropped and if 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.580
 they have a fight and they look
