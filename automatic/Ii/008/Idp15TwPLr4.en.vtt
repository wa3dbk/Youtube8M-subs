where<00:00:18.850> I've<00:00:19.090> been<00:00:19.240> operating<00:00:19.420> because<00:00:19.990> fluid

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
where I've been operating because fluid

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.530 
where I've been operating because fluid
will<00:00:20.770> accumulate<00:00:21.130> there<00:00:21.610> in<00:00:21.850> many<00:00:22.120> procedures

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
will accumulate there in many procedures

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.130 
will accumulate there in many procedures
such<00:00:23.380> as<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.560> tummy<00:00:23.830> tuck<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.540> we<00:00:25.540> want<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:25.990> get

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
such as a tummy tuck and we want to get

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.430 
such as a tummy tuck and we want to get
that<00:00:26.320> fluid<00:00:26.560> out<00:00:26.740> so<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.220> healing<00:00:27.490> will<00:00:27.730> go<00:00:27.850> on

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
that fluid out so the healing will go on

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.230 
that fluid out so the healing will go on
successfully<00:00:29.440> now<00:00:30.280> the<00:00:30.340> drain<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:30.820> composed

the drain is coming out of the skin and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
the drain is coming out of the skin and
this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.060> where<00:01:33.300> Manny's<00:01:33.750> fingers<00:01:34.140> are

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320

this is where Manny's fingers are
holding<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> sometimes<00:01:35.670> you'll<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.480> some

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
holding it sometimes you'll get to some

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.290 
holding it sometimes you'll get to some
small<00:01:37.950> blood<00:01:38.160> clot<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.760> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.180> of

close to where it comes out from the
skin<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.420> pull<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.830> out

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
skin and then you pull all this out

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.050 
skin and then you pull all this out
towards<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.940> bowl<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:58.160> then<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.729> release

that which creates a vacuum bringing
this<00:02:03.149> towards<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> bulb<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.560> do

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
this towards the bulb and you can do

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
this towards the bulb and you can do
this<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.399> way<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> ball<00:02:09.229> so

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
this all the way out to the ball so

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.160 
this all the way out to the ball so
basically<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.840> squeezing<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
basically you're just squeezing it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.840 
basically you're just squeezing it
together<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.739> moving<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.250> fingers<00:02:14.550> away

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
together and moving your fingers away

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
together and moving your fingers away
from<00:02:15.150> where<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> skin<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:16.709> letting

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
from where the skin is and then letting

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.140 
from where the skin is and then letting
go<00:02:17.070> close<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> skin<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.040> helps<00:02:20.150> move

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
go close to the skin and that helps move

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.840 
go close to the skin and that helps move
any<00:02:21.510> debris<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.680> blood<00:02:23.040> clots<00:02:23.310> towards<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
any debris or blood clots towards the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.500 
any debris or blood clots towards the
reservoir

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.470 

now<00:02:29.290> we're<00:02:29.650> going<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.890> show<00:02:30.099> you<00:02:30.159> how<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.849> empty

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
now we're going to show you how to empty

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.649 
now we're going to show you how to empty
and<00:02:31.690> record<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:33.159> fluid<00:02:33.610> that's<00:02:34.090> coming<00:02:34.480> out

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
and record the fluid that's coming out

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.039 
and record the fluid that's coming out
of<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.870> reservoir<00:02:35.700> okay<00:02:36.700> during<00:02:37.690> your<00:02:37.840> pre-op

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
of the reservoir okay during your pre-op

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.740 
of the reservoir okay during your pre-op
but<00:02:38.440> we<00:02:38.560> will<00:02:38.830> discuss<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.970> go<00:02:40.120> over<00:02:40.450> drain

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
care you will see that the fluid is in

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.410 
care you will see that the fluid is in
