some<00:03:06.500> things<00:03:06.740> there<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.310> some<00:03:07.550> things<00:03:07.820> that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
some things there and some things that

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.850 
some things there and some things that
aren't<00:03:08.300> Google<00:03:08.780> will<00:03:08.870> surely<00:03:09.260> update<00:03:09.650> over

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
aren't Google will surely update over

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.440 
aren't Google will surely update over
the<00:03:09.950> course<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.459> coming<00:03:10.670> months<00:03:11.060> as<00:03:11.150> new

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
the course of the coming months as new

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.720 
the course of the coming months as new
features<00:03:11.810> become<00:03:12.110> available<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.950> api's<00:03:13.489> are

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
features become available the api's are

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.850 
features become available the api's are
all<00:03:14.060> there<00:03:14.390> but<00:03:14.600> no<00:03:14.810> apps<00:03:15.050> use<00:03:15.320> them<00:03:15.530> yet<00:03:15.709> so

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
all there but no apps use them yet so

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.440 
all there but no apps use them yet so
it's<00:03:16.010> kind<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.370> hard<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.670> look<00:03:16.880> at<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> deeper

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
it's kind of hard to look at the deeper

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.660 
it's kind of hard to look at the deeper
features<00:03:17.870> with<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.500> said<00:03:18.800> let's<00:03:19.220> get<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.519> to

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
features with that said let's get on to

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.759 
features with that said let's get on to
part<00:03:19.910> two<00:03:19.940> during<00:03:20.630> my<00:03:20.750> testing<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.290> wasn't<00:03:21.620> able

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
part two during my testing I wasn't able

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.320 
part two during my testing I wasn't able
to<00:03:21.980> check<00:03:22.190> out<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.459> new<00:03:22.610> permission<00:03:23.120> system

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
to check out the new permission system

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.330 
to check out the new permission system
because<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.080> available<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.709> yet<00:03:25.040> in

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
because it's not available just yet in

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.100 
because it's not available just yet in
this<00:03:25.700> new<00:03:25.910> permission<00:03:26.390> system<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.840> won't

this new permission system you won't

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.750 
this new permission system you won't
agree<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.530> permissions<00:03:28.130> when<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.400> install

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
agree to permissions when you install

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.850 
agree to permissions when you install
applications<00:03:29.510> but<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.989> will<00:03:30.200> agree<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.590> them

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
applications but you will agree to them

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.530 
applications but you will agree to them
when<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> application<00:03:31.760> actually<00:03:32.120> needs<00:03:32.330> them

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
when the application actually needs them

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.509 
when the application actually needs them
and<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.959> can<00:03:33.140> approve<00:03:33.470> or<00:03:33.709> deny<00:03:33.950> them<00:03:34.310> then

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
and you can approve or deny them then

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.790 
and you can approve or deny them then
however<00:03:35.239> part<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.750> this<00:03:35.840> system<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.440> in<00:03:36.680> the

however part of this system is in the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.620 
however part of this system is in the
preview<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.459> go<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.060> settings<00:03:38.450> and

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
preview you can go to the settings and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.449 
preview you can go to the settings and
check<00:03:38.780> out<00:03:38.959> which<00:03:39.200> applications<00:03:39.980> have<00:03:40.220> which

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
check out which applications have which

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.220 
check out which applications have which
permissions<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.209> then<00:03:41.390> turn<00:03:41.690> them<00:03:41.810> off<00:03:41.989> from

permissions and then turn them off from

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.530 
permissions and then turn them off from
there<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.010> back<00:03:43.220> end<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.640> present<00:03:44.209> just

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
there so the back end is present just

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.420 
there so the back end is present just
not<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.870> google<00:03:45.170> play<00:03:45.200> store<00:03:45.380> part<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.070> you

looked<00:03:51.500> for<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.010> couldn't<00:03:52.370> find<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
looked for and couldn't find is the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.090 
looked for and couldn't find is the
chrome<00:03:53.269> custom<00:03:53.570> tabs<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> built-in

chrome custom tabs this is a built-in

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.800 
chrome custom tabs this is a built-in
version<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.760> Chrome<00:03:56.030> browser<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.630> app

version of the Chrome browser that app

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.810 
version of the Chrome browser that app
developers<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.620> add<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:58.010> their<00:03:58.130> applications

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
developers can add to their applications

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.190 
developers can add to their applications
so<00:03:59.180> they<00:03:59.269> don't<00:03:59.390> have<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.630> build<00:03:59.989> their<00:04:00.140> own

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200

we'll<00:04:12.049> see<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.470> more<00:04:12.739> developers<00:04:13.280> support<00:04:13.730> it

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
we'll see as more developers support it

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.780 
we'll see as more developers support it
unfortunately<00:04:15.049> Android<00:04:15.560> pay<00:04:15.799> is<00:04:16.010> not<00:04:16.370> in<00:04:16.640> the

unfortunately Android pay is not in the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.699 
unfortunately Android pay is not in the
Developer<00:04:17.359> Preview<00:04:17.630> at<00:04:18.020> least<00:04:18.229> we<00:04:18.380> couldn't

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
Developer Preview at least we couldn't

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.849 
Developer Preview at least we couldn't
find<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.430> tat

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
find it the tat

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.619 
find it the tat
pay<00:04:20.009> section<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.549> still<00:04:20.819> in<00:04:20.969> the<00:04:21.090> settings<00:04:21.419> but

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:21.629 
pay section is still in the settings but

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.480 
pay section is still in the settings but
it's<00:04:21.750> essentially<00:04:22.259> empty<00:04:22.530> there<00:04:23.099> are<00:04:23.250> any

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it's essentially empty there are any

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.249 
it's essentially empty there are any
applications<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.419> use<00:04:24.629> those<00:04:24.870> features

applications that use those features

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.140 
applications that use those features
anyway<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:26.009> makes<00:04:26.219> sense<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.610> Android

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
anyway so it makes sense that Android
