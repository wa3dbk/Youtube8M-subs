connected to the motherboard and that's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.830 
connected to the motherboard and that's
128<00:00:16.470> megabytes<00:00:17.000> and<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.720> really

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
128 megabytes and it's just really

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.099 
128 megabytes and it's just really
crappy<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.310> dual<00:00:20.609> displays<00:00:20.970> now<00:00:21.210> even

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
crappy and I have dual displays now even

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.570 
crappy and I have dual displays now even
though<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.410> right<00:00:22.619> here<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> big<00:00:23.189> clunky

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
though this right here is a big clunky

though this right here is a big clunky
CRT<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.840> my<00:00:24.990> other<00:00:25.140> LCD<00:00:25.740> which<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.099> 19

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
CRT I have my other LCD which is 19

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910 
CRT I have my other LCD which is 19
inches<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.170> they'd<00:00:28.170> still<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:28.590> display

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
inches so they'd still go display

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529 
inches so they'd still go display
whether<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> CRT<00:00:29.789> or<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:30.060> whatever<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
whether it's a CRT or not whatever it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.490 
whether it's a CRT or not whatever it
works<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.630> graphics<00:00:34.050> card<00:00:34.260> won't

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
works and so that graphics card won't

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
works and so that graphics card won't
really<00:00:34.770> work<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.160> door<00:00:35.340> displays<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> got

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270

Macintosh<00:01:57.289> okay<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.780> reading<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.020> little

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
Macintosh okay I'm just reading a little

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.600 
Macintosh okay I'm just reading a little
things<00:02:01.440> on<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> side<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> doubt<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.430> read

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
things on the side I doubt you can read

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.490 
things on the side I doubt you can read
them<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.600> pause<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.840> probably<00:02:04.440> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
them but you can pause it probably and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.670 
them but you can pause it probably and
probably<00:02:05.039> make<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:06.570> anyway<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.170> just

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
probably make that out but anyway I just

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.600 
probably make that out but anyway I just
don't<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
now is just PCI well I had the on board

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.380 
now is just PCI well I had the on board
and<00:02:19.530> then<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:19.739> friend<00:02:20.040> let<00:02:20.250> me<00:02:20.280> his<00:02:20.850> old<00:02:21.120> video
