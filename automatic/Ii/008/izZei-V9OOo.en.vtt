00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:09.309
 whiskey punkt.de meeting point fine 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.079
 spirits welcome whiskey store 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.209
 the meeting place in front of a ghost and 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.369
 Today I have the Oceans champagne bottle 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.490
 while a large bottle one 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.850
 liter bottle from the meeting value 40 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.720
 volume percent suffering and this 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.390
 you can select that almost so 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.940
 have the old russian classic pictures 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.129
 I tried this is the entry 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.719
 there is no special painting 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.210
 age information can be made 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.039
 but almost stated that is one 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.960
 clear special of this entry was 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.589
 but is also distilled in bags 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.989
 triple 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.030
 This makes the alcohol particularly mild 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.269
 and soft on people say that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.109
 Flavors stay behind as you do 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.469
 it wants and this light whiskey 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.839
 along with light barrels so 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.409
 not the extreme flavors up there now 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.930
 give the whiskey leads to one 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:09.520
 light mild soft single paints 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.830
 whiskeys the classic I mean 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.690
 now out of print 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.430
 the select is going in this direction 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.010
 for the liter bottle comparatively 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.070
 cheap and thus one would like to say one 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.600
 einstiegs paints and from below I have 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.670
 already tried a lot and have here 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.010
 I use the playlist because they can times 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.050
 click on everything from bags here 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:38.320
 Already looking at the almost now 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:40.870
 We triple on the box is as 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.370
 drive attests high alcohol content 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.770
 burn with over 80 volume percent 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.240
 out of the third blister out at rai 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.520
 founded in 1823 at the very beginning of the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.110
 Big licensing wave in Scotland 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.360
 The distillery is located north of the dress 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.140
 This is the sea arm of Glasgow 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.270
 Feels pure and the 160 I think gave it 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.220
 to the world merchant fleet at over two 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.460
 third of this world merchant fleet is in 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.750
 So I was there 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.209
 The industry was really busy 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.500
 and there was the authentic one too 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.800
 Distillery right there at the source or 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.630
 on the thirsty throats of the whole 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.280
 shipyard worker you have the to the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.940
 You can not afford it 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 and then there's the electro casting 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.290
 selected oak barrels yes if that only 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 is a positive choice or that only 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.360
 negative because it takes me here only 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.100
 the simply matured no idea and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.440
 they advertise for the other whiskeys 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.239
 so you have fresh oak barrels 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.250
 use with the others so they do 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.750
 the cherry and otherwise port wine 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 friborg and so use and say here 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.459
 she selected oak barrels is one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.519
 a bit thin for those of you 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.830
 go in and read balance 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.470
 wonderful thing for the author already 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.380
 up and down knows it is nothing here 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.300
 good here always distilled three times in 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.010
 this carefully selected 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:14.670
 oak casks a subtle roland single 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.769
 paints whiskey with a distinctive aroma 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.420
 on christina's process with one 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.530
 special aroma of green apples yes 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:30.380
 probably a bit hesitant 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:34.260
 fruity fresh citrus and the soft 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.590
 delicious authentic taste will 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.530
 now see what comes out there like in 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.769
 case a murder bottle have something in the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.150
 hand 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.150
 really a liter in it 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.340
 We are heavy on three ministers 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.340
 All have gotten here 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:23.720
 do not look pushy 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:28.490
 too much oak cute beautiful fruitiness 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.620
 above may the green apple I have it 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.620
 but not absolute will I have yes 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.590
 and pull the foul 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.849
 yes and that is not all this totally 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:49.430
 sour but a bit juicier 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:51.830
 over to the clementines maybe the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.660
 Malerin note is not very strong there 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.099
 speaks for that either refill 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:03.880
 barrels or the whiskey not really 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:08.870
 old but beautiful dog balanced 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:11.680
 now it depends a little bit on him 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.680
 from the distance 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.740
 little stronger certainly influenced 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.749
 here and now in the background is the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.439
 So not just three years old has the 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:50.849
 seen me more than three years is 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:52.259
 Already rich with young people 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.819
 I find a metallic character even 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.569
 certainly not because he 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:00.379
 its worth three times and yes has 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:04.110
 speaks for others that is even older 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.819
 get a bit drier now 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.520
 I do not want to leave it as a departure 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:20.419
 really long but soja 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:20.419
 medium fruity fruity 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:35.779
 now less apples over too 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:39.729
 sweet fruits so juicy pears and the 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.729
 Citrus wants that now very sweet 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:46.459
 to have nice dns out there have it 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:48.439
 should not be too expensive if the 

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:50.089
 Presented a large amount wants 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.559
 and they still do not rage 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:53.509
 want to let a decent piece 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:55.969
 deliver work craftwork here 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.659
 also want to disappoint select is exactly 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.429
 the right one 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:00.139
 Look at me if system like 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:01.819
 the classic has it already 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:05.509
 caught he is currently not available 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:08.569
 but the select now fills this gap 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.809
 thank you very much 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.809
 watch
