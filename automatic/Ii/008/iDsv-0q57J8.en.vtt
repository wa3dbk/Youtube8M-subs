00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.490
 Club az 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.980
 Ask some somewhat maniac issues about it from now on 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.239
 To do 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.009
 Please answer in the form of Marubatu. 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.539
 Change in the first 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.949
 It is a game that Jockey wears in a race game. 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.060
 Well, that game is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.740
 If Jockey cooks on the day of the race on the day of the race 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 Punishment 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.499
 Great circle 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.390
 Sorry 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.359
 After all 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.510
 It is punishment 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.010
 The match clothes are each 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.340
 No horse for horse, that is, a difficult item and the design of idea is also a property of horse 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.080
 I am supposed to wear what I decided 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.660
 what is it 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.530
 Then it is the second mon 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.080
 Thoroughbred is not a good investment for my birthday 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.940
 Covered covered 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.400
 At ultra baht 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.410
 It's a shame the world is around now or 32 people are doing it all year round 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.530
 I do not mean that 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.369
 Yes or not everyone is good every January 1st 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.770
 Do you go out and get older? 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.620
 Then the third problem organizer 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.640
 The night before the race 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.240
 Jockey does not go to the convenience store 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 A bunch of turns 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060
 Is the correct answer 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.600
 You know 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.580
 I see, this is the evening before the day to ensure the race's fairness 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.040
 Enter the room from the adjustment m 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.990
 Limit price range high and low price so as to make contact with the outside 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.410
 Well, I knew well, but I did this 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.280
 Then continue to the 4th Mon 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.480
 The helmet is worn when the jockey is s 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.009
 Made of Styrofoam 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.770
 Covered covered 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.210
 And he is better 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 There is also a good point of the angle 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.910
 Are you a committee member 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 Trigger 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.310
 As a catcher 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.050
 Sorry it was a circle 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.749
 The minimum is ahead 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:13.559
 Because I've been waiting for the hot river and I'm looking for a good file 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.490
 It's exactly like having a stab 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.060
 Styrofoam is actually surprisingly strong with everyone 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.529
 9 wins for helmets 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:23.149
 Complete deer horse finish 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.149
 Then followed by the first Yamaba 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.869
 Horse dung in horse racing terms 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.859
 In other words, between fares 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:32.740
 It is called 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.549
 Marka punishment 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.939
 Joint 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.939
 City is like 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.789
 It is a part 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.529
 The correct answer is late 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.429
 Can you ask me there? 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.429
 Unfortunately it is a policy to discontinue results and balls 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.139
 Then the sixth one 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.870
 It is invalid if the betting ticket is not refunded to the person emigration 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.150
 Become 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.269
 1 round off Marutaba 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.909
 That's right 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
 It is all right within 6021 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.809
 The problem is over at the hall 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:12.659
 Thank you very much 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.659
 Was 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.209
 March
