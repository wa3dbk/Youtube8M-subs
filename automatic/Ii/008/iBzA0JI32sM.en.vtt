everything is well combined that's
called<00:04:40.919> tempering<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.490> end<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.360> that's<00:04:42.570> just

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
called tempering the end and that's just

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.270 
called tempering the end and that's just
bringing<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.080> up<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.229> a<00:04:43.380> temperature<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.130> it's

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
bringing it up to a temperature so it's

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.310 
bringing it up to a temperature so it's
not<00:04:44.400> going<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.970> curdle<00:04:45.389> we<00:04:45.600> added<00:04:45.870> directly<00:04:46.229> to

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
not going to curdle we added directly to

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.490 
not going to curdle we added directly to
