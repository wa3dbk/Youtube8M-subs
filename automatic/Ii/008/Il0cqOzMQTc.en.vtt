00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 yo everyone I hope it me 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.470
 it's going great today I present you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.760
 a little video about how and about 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.460
 techniques how to attack with 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.530
 people so I stopped 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.780
 I stopped trying me crazy troops and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.949
 now I'm going to techniques 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.330
 my last crowd projection it was the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.220
 witch I think it was a small 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.510
 nice girl and now I'm going on 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.279
 the techniques had this time 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.449
 it's a giant technique then as 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.480
 you can see it was a village 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.279
 easy and not very easy so easy 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 because they did not have to be mom 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.690
 she had no very good defense the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 walls separates then goes for them 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 walls it's useless to put any 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.870
 put the two walls like that there 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.910
 around because ak I bet it's silly 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 both at the same time so it serves to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 nothing and then it was easy too because 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.950
 they did not have small squares 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 so wary he was doing it and it was 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.160
 good and not very easy at the same time 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.570
 because they were spaced apart and one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.010
 village spaced for people it's 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 never very good and there as you can 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 see him I'm gonna he had kidnapped the queen 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 and the king of the barbarians but that's 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 forget the castle plan what put me 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.809
 a little problem elsewhere on 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.100
 millions so here's showing you after 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 the technique 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.689
 finally how to attack with people 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 that's it someone buddy to me who you 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.760
 have given and I find 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.140
 friendly who walks who works when 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.700
 we want to gain resources easily 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 after if you want to win 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.009
 the election of gold even more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.320
 easily attack with friends but 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.490
 with seysses pigs of elections so 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.189
 you want to save for excellence 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.220
 and by his faux-pas tech with pig 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.360
 to attack people with dirty tricks 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.159
 so I had then I had 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.170
 makes a video about mythos to 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.150
 solo goblins so I'll make you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.100
 because they are still a little 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.320
 hard and now finally it's enough 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.210
 friendly and I was told that already 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 made with scarves at cissÃ© I was told 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.460
 that someone tries with archers that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 who told me that it had not worked 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.049
 so if you want I 'll do it with 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.479

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.759

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.130
 I'm speeding up so I made a 100% 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.130
 but I had a bowl 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.180
 that's it, as you can see 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.220
 I attack with 12 there at all 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.780
 if you bought 8 you attack had 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.270
