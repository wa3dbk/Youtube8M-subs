00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
month or whatever but it's clear and

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.510 
month or whatever but it's clear and
it's<00:00:50.270> effectively<00:00:50.720> UNAIDS<00:00:51.140> it's<00:00:52.130> just<00:00:52.370> what

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
it's effectively UNAIDS it's just what

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.220 
it's effectively UNAIDS it's just what
comes<00:00:52.640> out<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.880> still<00:00:53.239> essentially<00:00:53.780> can<00:00:54.170> you

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
comes out of still essentially can you

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.630 
comes out of still essentially can you
also<00:00:54.410> have<00:00:54.650> your<00:00:54.829> spiced<00:00:55.100> rum

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
so those oftentimes are white rums maybe

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.900 
so those oftentimes are white rums maybe

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
are like pitch black and then you have

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.610 
are like pitch black and then you have
the<00:01:16.880> least<00:01:17.180> popular<00:01:17.870> of<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.140> wrong<00:01:18.320> it's<00:01:18.530> as

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
far as the fabric stayed so I'm gonna

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.590 
profile getting any aged rum is coming
from<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.070> barrel<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.670> lot<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:52.970> people<00:01:53.150> they

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
from the barrel so a lot of people they

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.310 
from the barrel so a lot of people they
mistake<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.170> sweetness<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.770> their<00:01:54.920> team

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
mistake the sweetness of their team

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.130 
mistake the sweetness of their team
in<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.430> run<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.970> know<00:02:00.090> sugar<00:02:00.810> that

comes out of the molasses and that's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
comes out of the molasses and that's
nothing<00:02:04.890> further<00:02:05.160> than<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.460> truth<00:02:05.580> what

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
nothing further than the truth what

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.660 
nothing further than the truth what
happens<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.870> fermentation<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.800> yeast

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
happens in fermentation is the yeast

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
happens in fermentation is the yeast
consume<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.600> sugar<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> molasses

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
consume all the sugar in the molasses

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.070 
consume all the sugar in the molasses
converted<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> alcohol<00:02:11.850> and<00:02:12.120> then<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
converted the alcohol and then in the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.680 
converted the alcohol and then in the
distillation<00:02:13.470> process<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.880> concentrate

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
distillation process you concentrate

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.020 
distillation process you concentrate
that<00:02:15.900> alcohol<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.010> when<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.640> coming<00:02:17.910> out<00:02:17.970> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that alcohol so when it's coming out of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.900 
that alcohol so when it's coming out of
the<00:02:18.210> still<00:02:18.510> there's<00:02:19.110> no<00:02:19.230> sugar<00:02:19.530> left<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
the still there's no sugar left in and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.150 
the still there's no sugar left in and
so<00:02:21.170> what<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> end<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.590> doing<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.890> doing<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
so what you end up doing is doing a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.580 
so what you end up doing is doing a
putting<00:02:23.370> sugar<00:02:23.640> back<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.540> when<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.170> agent

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
putting sugar back in it when you agent

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.530 
putting sugar back in it when you agent
in<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.740> barrel<00:02:26.070> because<00:02:26.430> what's<00:02:27.120> happening

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
in the barrel because what's happening

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.690 
in the barrel because what's happening
is<00:02:27.660> these<00:02:27.870> barrels<00:02:28.380> they'll<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.250> cut<00:02:29.490> down<00:02:29.670> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is these barrels they'll just cut down a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.840 
is these barrels they'll just cut down a
tree<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.570> barrel<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.040> whole<00:02:32.130> possible

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
tree in a barrel like the whole possible

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.330 
tree in a barrel like the whole possible
so<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.750> barrel<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.620> only<00:02:34.740> cleaning<00:02:35.100> up

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
so the barrel is not only cleaning up

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.730 
so the barrel is not only cleaning up
the<00:02:35.490> spirit<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.330> also<00:02:36.510> allowing<00:02:36.930> allowing

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the spirit it's also allowing allowing

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.410 
the spirit it's also allowing allowing
it<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.830> oxidize<00:02:38.370> over<00:02:38.640> time<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.270> not

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
it to oxidize over time but it's not

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.530 
it to oxidize over time but it's not
airtight<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.130> then<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.790> also<00:02:42.000> imparting

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
airtight and then it's also imparting

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.860 
airtight and then it's also imparting
the<00:02:42.690> spice<00:02:42.959> character<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.970> sweetness<00:02:45.240> as

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the spice character and the sweetness as

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.080 
the spice character and the sweetness as
well<00:02:46.080> as<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> color<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.770> oak<00:02:46.980> players<00:02:47.489> to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
well as the color in the oak players to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.449 
well as the color in the oak players to
the<00:02:48.239> rough<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.709> kind<00:02:50.340> of
