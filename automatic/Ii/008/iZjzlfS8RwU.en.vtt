00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.799
 when there is a recognition problem 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.469
 of an epson cartridge in status monitor 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.759
 the message is displayed 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.820
 impossible to recognize the cartridge of 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.070
 ink or a similar message 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.880
 in printers without display the light 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:31.660
 corresponding to the stop ink button 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.030
 or assistance is red or yellow for 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.710
 the first thing to identify is the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.830
 ink cartridge that does not come 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.080
 recognized in display printers 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.239
 unrecognized cartridges come 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.180
 indicated in a message or with an icon 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.280
 on the display in printers without 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.230
 display you can know which cartridge 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.129
 causes the problem by status 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.930
 monitor is better to use the status monitor 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.300
 to check the status of the cartridges 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.219
 ink since the lights can be used 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.280
 turn on for many different problems 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.470
 not just unrecognized cartridges for 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.070
 further information read the manual 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.070
 of the printer 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.550
 once identified it extracts from the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.360
 printer the cartridge that has problems e 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.460
 inspect the cartridge carefully 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.810
 may lose ink and stain 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 clothes or furniture to avoid 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.830
 damage the printer do not force 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.830
 manually moving the cart 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.130
 check that the yellow tab is 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.600
 been removed from the top 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.340
 of the cartridge this tab closes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.990
 the ventilation hole and prevents 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.990
 to the ink to use correctly 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.250
 clean the cartridge chip with 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 isopropyl alcohol and a pair 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.830
 soft paying attention to not 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.830
 damage 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.780
 check that the cartridges are in place 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.210
 in the correct slots in many 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
 printers the correct order is indicated 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.960
 from the applied colored guide label 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.790
 on the plastic support in 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.840
 correspondence of the position of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:29.520
 cartridge replacement checks 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.310
 that the cartridge is actually 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.770
 suitable for the Epson printer model 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.690
 for own commercial policies to a 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.290
 infinite number of cartridge types 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.020
 often very similar it detaches the thread 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.970
 electric 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.580
 and clean contacts between printers 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.340
 cartridge may have ink 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.350
 dry paper or dust that prevents 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.950
 the correct contact between printer and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.950
 cartridge 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.210
 or they could be crooked or 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.880
 damage the contact strips in the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.030
 case replace using a small one 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.030
 screwdriver 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.640
 do not leave the printer too long 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.130
 without a cartridge inserted 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.319
 the ink may dry in the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.319
 head and cause printing problems 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.480
 check that the seal has stopped 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.560
 correctly if you have not pierced furan 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 with the tip of a scissors 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.780
 replace the cartridge by pressing the well 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.610
 downward 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.269
 check that they are all correctly 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.269
 installed 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.810
 if you still don't try this, turn on the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.400
 printer remove the cartridge you don't 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.400
 is recognized by the printer 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.330
 turn off the printer 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:17.709
 after a few minutes turn the power back on 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:21.570
 printer return the cartridge sometimes 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.570
 it works and the printer restarts 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.430
 if the problem persists remove 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.000
 again the cartridge following the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.790
 instructions in the manual test a 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.040
 replace the cartridge with another one 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.650
 if the problem resolves the cartridge 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.110
 it was bad the epson to prevent 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.510
 the use of compatible cartridges creates many 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.490
 sometimes even complications 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.400
 original cartridges have problems with 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.530
 clear recognition given that if 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.330
 use compatible cartridges to put one 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.400
 original cartridge may cause problems 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.920
 recognition of cartridges not 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.900
 originals she doesn't do anything for 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:10.130
 complicate life for those who do not use their own 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:11.450
 cartridges check that the cartridge does not 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.340
 has expired 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.440
 it also happens that a cartridge has expired 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.770
 causes an error signal though 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.770
 new 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.030
 or leave the printer off for a 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.250
 little then try to replace all the 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.170
 not just that printer cartridges 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.350
 defective with new cartridges 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.350
 original 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.930
 if it still does not resolve, uninstall i 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.880
 driver and and install a driver more 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.780
 recently downloaded from the official website 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:53.490
 epson if you need this is a guide on 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.490
 how to download install a driver 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.870
 however, never update drivers a 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.810
 unless it is necessary as in 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.910
 this case driver updates 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.340
 cause recognition problems 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.490
 compatible cartridges and carry very few 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.490
 advantages 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.920
 if there is still the error message 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.600
 unplug the cable leave the printer 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.600
 turned off for an hour or even longer 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:32.620
 then put the cable back and turn it back on 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:33.190
 printer sometimes unlocks if not 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.410
 it works 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.050
 the printer is probably defective 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.640
 send it to Epson assistance but first 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.960
 remember to install cartridges 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.120
 original 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.610
 otherwise the epson assistance will give the 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.780
 fault to compatible cartridges 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.780
 refusing the warranty or repair
