and I get that I agree with that makes
sense

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
sense

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.890 
sense
and<00:02:02.010> once<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.369> left<00:02:02.580> Dream<00:02:02.820> Theater<00:02:03.150> I<00:02:03.450> think

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
and once I left Dream Theater I think

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.590 
and once I left Dream Theater I think
too<00:02:04.050> much<00:02:04.260> attention<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:05.100> brought<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.420> them

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
too much attention got brought to them

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.199 
too much attention got brought to them
for<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> wrong<00:02:07.110> reason<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.580> once<00:02:08.940> my

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
for the wrong reason so I think once my

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.060 
for the wrong reason so I think once my
time<00:02:09.630> we<00:02:10.050> agreed<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.470> original<00:02:10.830> agreed-upon

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
time we agreed the original agreed-upon
