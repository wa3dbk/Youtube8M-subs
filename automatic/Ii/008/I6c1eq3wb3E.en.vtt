00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
and I thought it would be a good idea to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.710 
and I thought it would be a good idea to
do<00:00:48.440> anyway<00:00:48.830> since<00:00:49.520> I<00:00:49.640> have<00:00:49.850> all<00:00:50.120> these<00:00:50.270> empty

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
do anyway since I have all these empty

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.619 
do anyway since I have all these empty

water<00:00:53.960> enhancer<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:54.800> what<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.250> is<00:00:55.519> pretty

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
water enhancer so what it is is pretty

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.640

it's terrible for you this has been over

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.140 
it's terrible for you this has been over
the<00:01:12.620> course<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:13.040> months<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.700> months<00:01:13.850> I<00:01:14.120> just

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
the course of months and months I just

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.390
