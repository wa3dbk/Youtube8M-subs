see<00:01:03.660> heat<00:01:04.559> range<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.660> adjust<00:01:08.450> room<00:01:09.450> fan

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
see heat range you can adjust room fan

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.670 
see heat range you can adjust room fan
every<00:01:10.740> fan<00:01:11.010> till<00:01:11.220> 9:00<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> auto

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
of with the heat range alone three I

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.870 
of with the heat range alone three I
don't<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.510> I<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.320> mixture
