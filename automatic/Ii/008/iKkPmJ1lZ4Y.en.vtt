done this if you go to settings displays

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.789 
done this if you go to settings displays
and<00:01:53.840> arrangement<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.109> could<00:01:55.289> choose<00:01:55.529> how<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
do it and I've got mine on vertical

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.620 
do it and I've got mine on vertical
because<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.939> how<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.270> it
