00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.610
 with some friends and the escoles they watch you videos are speculated 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 of course by putting more videos channels of different types of 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.509
 exercises 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.219
 is a new person also of showers classes and I hope you like to hear it 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.230
 and you can tell I have earthenware 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.429
 the long socks and and funny steve 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.999
 but 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.339
 to the thread of it a video 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.839
 about more than anything else successful explanation of the psoe explains the csic 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.310
 he explained that this problem with that 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.150
 and so 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.250
 more than anything for these people who asked me for this video 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.590
 I hope you enjoy 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.990
 but good chinchilla expressed is one of the biggest problems to occur 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.960
 in this game here 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 he is called in Spanish the table also pimple 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 from this afternoon until you can see it 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.560
 because this problem occurs 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.990
 because I'm sad comes to not read text this part the kia so much that you do not 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.300
 let it run 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.850
 one of the most frequent causes for which hide problem is 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990
 when you go running a lot of the time when you go running 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.510
 the pass pasture 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.740
 the people that happened apart from that Tehran rejects 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.880
 type of toll 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.420
 and that's where the problem starts 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.330
 the most when you go with henrique tello 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.790
 20 million 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 that filmax the first hypothesis that you hit here 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 the bus on the other hand of its activity 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.240
 the current moment 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.290
 but certainly a muscle 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.190
 103 there the problem starts here is one of the most problems 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.960
 because people got hurt here 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.450
 Another problem can also be a shoe fights shoe 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.010
 emma las was the oriental although this part 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.000
 and also because they can be broken down 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.300
 by simple implies having problems with this 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.010
 others with problems that cause this is when you are running 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.460
 many times when poorer mostly the athletes we want 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.970
 learn to run well 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.970
 we started running against him 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.120
 I do not think it's wrong that's fine because when you want to learn by 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.529
 what you have to know 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.709
 one day before Nestor pitana answer 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.629
 now it's about the tip 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.519
 so much learning but true 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.519
 this part tends to grow this muscle that is here 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.449
 I hope you can please you can make beds the camera 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:28.619
 so that he looks capable of everything 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.239
 they came to give 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.519
 then this part 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.530
 why 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.149
 with whatever the sixth 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.099
 the problem now 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.159
 I am solving problems as it happens in chile sprint very big problem that 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.459
 it starts to hurt and does not let you run saints that you have to do when you 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.359
 have this problem 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.099
 remember 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.869
 First 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.969
 three times a day you have to put ice 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.829
 for ten minutes 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.529
 you put 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.769
 A study 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.789
 and that's why for 10 minutes after that 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.599
 after 10 minutes for purposes a little 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.639
 i after five minutes 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.639
 its strength on the other hand ten minutes 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.609
 and then the afternoon at noon can do 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.189
 this week 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.469
 if you want more if you want to be able to run a little 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.069
 work in cinema the fine for too much excess to the establishment 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.189
 it hurts a lot that tapatía who cover the plot 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.219
 if you plan 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.789
 then you can run 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.609
 I recommend you not to run 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.979
 or what is better for them better than tandil 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.809
 why 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.139
 the problem halters are not only sterile remember that it can be more 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.390
 that an intern called out the external 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.850
 external problems by internal regulation are more difficult 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.850
 these products leaving aside it's better to stop running 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:53.499
 then the other 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.559
 is that if you are going to run 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.519
 besides laptops more or less strong 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.479
 that you squeeze stage and posts to pinotti questions 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.499
 even his server had a problem also a few months ago stopped 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.079
 by the civil guard 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.909
 and that's why Carlos Martínez Garbino 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.639
 the long socks what they do is that they squeeze up 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.570
 not now 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.009
 the times live 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.660
 of things that are specifically to cover this part of the csic 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.909
 which are the tigers mortgages that are 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.409
 open is to say that it does not concern us 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.289
 They are also great 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.780
 to compose is what you want is prix that is called in English from 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:32.680
 sparkle 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.789
 tic goods head 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.539
 they are agreements made soul 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.009
 three times a day 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.430
 long socks and said stop running for a good time until it's coming 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.120
 because that is an internal problem 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.560
 the internal problems you have to have faith that you pay them a lot of attention 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.000
 recent video
