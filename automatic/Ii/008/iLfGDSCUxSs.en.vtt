00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.820
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.820
 ahhhhhhhhh 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:20.100
 Culdcept starting with one sent by Culdcept 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.950
 Episode 3 is a battle of territory 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.920
 Please see here 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.080
 2 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.000
 If you place a monster from the card you have in the empty trout root in Culdcept 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.850
 Become my territory 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.020
 You can raise your level by spending money on your territory 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.950
 The higher the level, the stronger the monster's strength. 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.000
 To rise 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:53.110
 eh 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.250
 I monster that physical strength is increased will be very advantageous in the less likely to lose in the battle 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 Further noteworthy points are here 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.090
 It is the traffic volume 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.600
 When the level is raised, the traffic is also low 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.690
 I'm going up 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:16.230
 Hopefully it will be happy 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.250
 However, such high toll areas have a chance to steal much money from the other party 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.110
 One side 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.170
 There is a risk of being targeted and taken away exactly as it is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.800
 In preparation for when the other party has set up a fight 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.900
 It is Daisetsu to keep with the card to protect the room to 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.900
 For example, please look at this scene 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.990
 The other party is terrific in a high traffic area 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.670
 I've set up a battle with a monster that looks strong 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:54.970
 The opponent's attack power is higher than this strength 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 As the monster protecting the site is high school, it will lose in this way 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:05.360
 Such time, for example, this aidem curl 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.110
 Even high school monsters can attack before their opponents 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.110
 Then 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.270
 Is poly 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.820
 You did it, did not you 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.820
 Now we are approaching victory 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.830
 In this way, it is a battle to combine cards well 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.600
 It can be said that the best of Culdcept 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.740
 It is the point of today 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.740
 The battle of the source area uses victory with squares and cards 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.280
 Hmm 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:54.080
 Well Culdcept to start from scratch at this time is that it is the end that you introduce 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:59.140
 Honored you think If you can understand even a little of the Culdcept 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.140
 Board game cardo fight with cards
