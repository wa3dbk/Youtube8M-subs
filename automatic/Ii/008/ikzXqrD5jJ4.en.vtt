00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
radar it's no different color like my

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.300

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820

whatever
anyway<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:34.970> think<00:01:35.150> there's<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.480> pretty<00:01:35.630> solid

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
anyway I think there's a pretty solid

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.810 
anyway I think there's a pretty solid
gameplay<00:01:36.260> of<00:01:36.680> course<00:01:36.890> running<00:01:37.160> non-lethal

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
gameplay of course running non-lethal

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.360 
gameplay of course running non-lethal
going<00:01:38.570> with<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:38.780> lower<00:01:38.930> non-lethal<00:01:39.590> there's

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
going with the lower non-lethal there's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.100 
going with the lower non-lethal there's
two<00:01:40.520> versions<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:41.000> non-lethal<00:01:41.420> says<00:01:41.870> the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
two versions of non-lethal says the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.640 
two versions of non-lethal says the
counter<00:01:42.800> UAV<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> vm<00:01:44.150> visa<00:01:44.660> I'm<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.990> UAV

up<00:03:20.900> close<00:03:21.880> um<00:03:23.200> statistically<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.350> shows<00:03:24.560> that

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
up close um statistically it shows that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.920 
up close um statistically it shows that
it<00:03:24.920> has<00:03:25.070> all<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.700> two<00:03:25.940> little<00:03:26.360> boxes<00:03:26.570> filled

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
it has all but two little boxes filled

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
horrible range i mean i think it's like

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.340 
horrible range i mean i think it's like
you<00:03:34.220> might<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.400> less<00:03:34.730> range<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.180> shotgun<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
you might have less range in shotgun the
