00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 my question is such should be for something 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:14.889
 because in these difficult times and 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.619
 our taste like mustache bases and 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.770
 how are you now you have good 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.830
 Obviously when you go to a new country 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.560
 and good are different outputs today 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.260
 there are still complicated moments in 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.779
 low times and well I think it's 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.150
 which is a tool to improve for 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.000
 make yourself strong for that the moments 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.000
 hard go much better goalie 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.640
 for the left talking through the center 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.170
 the child to Spain once again I 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.950
 I would like to ask you about the absence of 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.410
 iker how do you value it and if you think 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.850
 It can be an advantage for you that 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.640
 best port in the world is not for 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.710
 I think winning shade whenever 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.199
 lack of iker because something is missing you should not 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.650
 he is the captain of the selection we are 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.650
 to the good Madrid is a great 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.900
 loss for Madrid because it does not have 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.540
 it has very good port montt not now 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.650
 with you the pc and with adam and well what 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.800
 will do just as well that it did that a 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.800
 great a sensible low for them 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 it has been seen that the level that is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.740
 finalized is marking us from outside the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.080
 area and the speed of the shots and 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540
 how do you prepare for that 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.370
 Yes I think everyone around the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.770
 world knows how they swallowed it aldo 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.930
 how ronaldo plays and good is clear 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.660
 what if the negative aircraft is 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.370
 complicated is not being able to defend your 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.890
 use but we're here to 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 try it and we will do our best 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.030
 so that in order to stop it and I do not believe 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.680
 that he is the only one who can stop to see 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.970
 how it hits you but how do I tell you 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.970
 we will try to do all possible
