00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 do not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.410
 in this video we are going to show you a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.090
 album we made for a birthday 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.000
 of a girl who wants him to put 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.700
 pictures of his daughters 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.420
 well we have mixed several collections 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420
 for do 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.199
 what are tapas 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.650
 and then what's inside is made with a 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.650
 single collection that is that of baby girl 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.560
 with which we made the boxes for the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.760
 christening 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.390
 I think it's from Jim Allister 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.620
 then for him 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.620
 for the covers we used another connection 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.270
 wv 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.310
 it's called the home foam stark 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.630
 then we have opted for a closure with 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.380
 a tie 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.380
 it opens like a window 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.420
 and then what's inside is that of 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.170
 the other collection of the one of imagine you 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.730

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730
 what does javi green 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.540
 and well all the back covers 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.430
 we have lined with the same paper 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.700
 and then the first page we have 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.979
 left blank to put a photo 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.049
 pretty big 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.150
 then every page and page there are pockets 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:20.470
 and we have made some shooters with some 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.400
 flowers with the 6 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.280
 as the girl is called laura because in the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.590

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.590

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.630

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.549

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.319

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.989
 tags that come all the cuts that 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.909
 come in the collection and we have 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.859
 put here stuck leaving a 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.439
 little hole to put the photos without 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.209

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.840

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.900
