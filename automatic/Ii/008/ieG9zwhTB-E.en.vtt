00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hello everyone from Germany, I'm glad 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:14.219
 greet you in your kitchen and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.050
 today i will cook for 6 this is such 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.119
 permanent ice need say or like ice 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.310
 which melts or vice versa which 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.009
 freezes 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.849
 we bought special syrup my children 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:34.120
 love this beach 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.160
 general syrup generally call it a blessing 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.809
 byronu put blueberry or what not 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 I know it is natural here is worth it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.530
 natural as he is divorced here 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.609
 It was 5 liters now how much we already 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.039
 did it delicious turns out 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.289
 he divorces one to five 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.600
 not today I will do it and show it 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:04.930
 in general, but probably who in 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.120
 Germany and knows usually in pools or 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.070
 if you go to the lake there always 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.070
 spinning so big 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.790
 but there are vehicles there this ice is spinning 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 and then you put the cup down and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.470
 pours 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 already say such a snowy snowy water 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.299
 or how it is not frozen there will be ice 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.060
 such growth and so we need clean water 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.009
 I picked it up from the cleaner and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.799
 sent the fridge to cool it 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:46.350
 here is 500 milliliters of this 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.350
 vodichke pure water and pour the 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:55.440
 ice cream bucket 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:01.490
 now syrup 100 milliliters 1 1 5 this 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:05.190
 5 parts water video and one part syrup 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.670
 100 milliliters I take a glass from 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.080
 bread maker years multicooker times but here 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.450
 it smells like you will immediately smell here 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.650
 There are divisions and therefore I eat them 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.050
 I measure here 100 milliliters so it is possible 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.530
 already turn on and pour out 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.530
 yes that's all 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.900
 there will be a way now 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.790
 c 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.790
 and everything was placed there 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.170
 The recipe for this is so 500 milliliters of water 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.510
 100 milliliters of syrup 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.819
 anybody is not necessarily so just mine 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.540
 kids like that i make cherry i 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.540
 doing all sorts of 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.710
 so what else do i add i add 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.770
 citric acid because so too 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.350
 sweet can be less syrup 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.380
 add well then I think it will not be tasty 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.850
 we just add more citric acid 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.850
 on the tip of a teaspoon 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.400
 somewhere here so here a little bit 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.860
 and now you need to wait about 30 minutes 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.080
 and then show what happens 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:35.850
 everything is ready 30 minutes have passed now I 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.850
 show shawls are turned 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.670
 here it should be 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.290
 it is even already very cold 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.689
 less 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.010
 okay, he will stand glass 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:54.010
 and will be 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.040
 everything is fine and now we take the most 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.069
 beautiful long such a cup of it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.650
 special glass and chairs 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.650
 freshness and recruit 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.920
 Here we recruit a full cup 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.920
 add a wand 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.630
 we are laying 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.940
 lid and here's a listen here well I 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.430
 a little bit 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.980
 incomplete typed well, I think enough 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.720
 and here is such a slide 6 and then it starts 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.720
 you can melt it later 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.340
 through the straw to drink very, very tasty 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.340
 refresh cools 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.030
 here he is 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.030
 it turns out 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.160
 and I wish you all good luck and see you soon 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.639
 in my kitchen 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.639
