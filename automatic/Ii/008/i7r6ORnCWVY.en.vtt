00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.140 
gopro hero4 camera having just come out
we<00:00:06.870> decided<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.440> do<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> tests<00:00:08.340> testing<00:00:08.760> for

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
we decided to do a tests testing for

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.110 
we decided to do a tests testing for
different<00:00:09.480> types<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.870> GoPro<00:00:10.580> battery<00:00:11.580> brands

different types of GoPro battery brands

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:22.340 
different types of GoPro battery brands
so<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:13.080> goes

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

now for this first test all of the
different<00:00:24.990> battery<00:00:25.320> brands<00:00:25.830> were<00:00:26.580> tested<00:00:26.910> at

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
different battery brands were tested at

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.340 
different battery brands were tested at

let's do some more tests only this time

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.230 
let's do some more tests only this time
we're<00:01:19.120> going<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.300> have<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.570> GoPro<00:01:19.990> at<00:01:20.260> 120fps

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
we're going to have the GoPro at 120fps

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
second and these last tests are just to

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.630 
second and these last tests are just to
give<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> rough<00:01:32.650> estimate<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:33.160> how<00:01:33.460> long

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
give you a rough estimate of how long

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.880 
give you a rough estimate of how long
you<00:01:33.850> can<00:01:33.880> expect<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.990> batteries<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.350> last<00:01:35.680> at

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
you can expect the batteries to last at

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:52.200 
you can expect the batteries to last at
these<00:01:36.340> different<00:01:36.729> settings

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.820 

all<00:01:52.720> right<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.140> as<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.500> see<00:01:53.650> in<00:01:53.740> these

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
all right and as you can see in these

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.109 
all right and as you can see in these
last<00:01:54.040> tests<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.580> was<00:01:54.640> really<00:01:54.880> interesting

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
last tests it was really interesting

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.180 
last tests it was really interesting
because<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.750> GoPro<00:01:56.170> having<00:01:56.530> been<00:01:56.680> filmed<00:01:57.010> at

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
because the GoPro having been filmed at

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.410 
because the GoPro having been filmed at
1080<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:58.510> at<00:01:58.659> 120<00:01:59.619> fps<00:02:00.150> actually<00:02:01.150> came<00:02:01.300> in

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
1080 in at 120 fps actually came in

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.050 
1080 in at 120 fps actually came in
first<00:02:01.720> place<00:02:01.990> as<00:02:02.260> far<00:02:02.470> as<00:02:02.560> battery<00:02:02.920> power<00:02:03.130> was

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
first place as far as battery power was

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.570 
first place as far as battery power was
concerned<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.680> other<00:02:05.710> two<00:02:05.950> new<00:02:06.130> MOA<00:02:06.310> and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
concerned the other two new MOA and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.059 
concerned the other two new MOA and
wasabi<00:02:06.970> batteries<00:02:07.630> were<00:02:08.200> fairly<00:02:08.590> similar<00:02:08.860> in

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
wasabi batteries were fairly similar in

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.160 
wasabi batteries were fairly similar in
time<00:02:09.789> differences<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.750> smart<00:02:11.020> tree

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
time differences and the smart tree

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.030 
time differences and the smart tree
battery<00:02:11.410> came<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.800> at<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.010> low<00:02:12.160> 39<00:02:12.580> minutes<00:02:14.040> all

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
battery came in at a low 39 minutes all

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.260 
battery came in at a low 39 minutes all
right<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> concludes<00:02:15.670> our<00:02:15.730> test<00:02:16.000> but<00:02:16.209> I'm

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
right that concludes our test but I'm

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.160 
right that concludes our test but I'm
going<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> leave<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> up<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.959> guys<00:02:16.989> to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
going to leave it up to you guys to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.680 
going to leave it up to you guys to
decide<00:02:17.680> which<00:02:18.010> battery<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.790> think<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.120> best

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
decide which battery you think is best

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.479 
decide which battery you think is best
for<00:02:20.470> me<00:02:20.560> personally<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.040> would<00:02:21.220> go<00:02:21.280> with<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
for me personally I would go with the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.059 
for me personally I would go with the
new<00:02:21.610> MOA<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.209> because<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.630> seemed<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.989> do<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
new MOA just because it seemed to do the

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.410 
new MOA just because it seemed to do the
best<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.489> all<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.000> tests<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.300> I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
best in all of the tests that I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.140 
best in all of the tests that I
performed<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:27.400> liked<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.670> video<00:02:27.970> make
