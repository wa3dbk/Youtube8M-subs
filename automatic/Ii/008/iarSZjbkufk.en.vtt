00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
gonna go ahead and read outline them

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:32.600

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.070 

getting<00:02:33.610> into<00:02:33.760> character<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.569> definitely

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
getting into character it's definitely

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.009 
getting into character it's definitely
better<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.409> use<00:02:35.739> thinner<00:02:36.610> tips<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.329> outline

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.880 
better to use thinner tips and outline
tips<00:02:42.989> kind<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.049> like<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.319> graffiti<00:02:44.680> piece

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890
