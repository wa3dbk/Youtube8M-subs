00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.280
 I had to travel on many many trips 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.290
 i really say problems with 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.160
 spring elements with leaked 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:25.630
 shock absorbers with bent rods with 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.670
 So really with very many 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.650
 shock absorbers also with retrofit products 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.770
 we thought about it 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.170
 means a shock absorber better too 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.830
 do it the right way to do it that way 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.500
 to measure that he's all bats all 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.930
 bumps all all 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.149
 record terrain features around it 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.160
 to protect the vehicle itself too 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.440
 so that's just not through the blows 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.440
 then go to the material of the motorcycle 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.090
 Who were 25 30 years as exempt 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 we already used our damper 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.930
 just to bring the travelers to the end 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.580
 because it was the fall then 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.080
 just do not build robust enough 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 nowadays is at the motorcycle manufacturer 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.270
 That's a little bit more robust, though 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.460
 Nevertheless , the manufacturers can not do so 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 individually on the chassis and pushes 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.750
 just like we do with ours 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.750
 goalkeeper extension banker can do 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.450
 every traveler will travel longer with his 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.430
 the motorcycle is on the road knows that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.560
 Suspension that's what's strongest 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.260
 is burdened by the takeover of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.149
 luggage or a straight on 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.310
 long trips you notice like the landing gear 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.040
 Diminished accordingly duratec has 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.150
 Years of experience in the field 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.550
 Adaptation of undercarriages 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.650
 therefore the touratech suspension 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.560
 Suspension in cooperation with the company 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.970
 track tÃ¼v creates the know-how and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.360
 the experience of touratech the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.380
 past years 20 years in the reason 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.660
 used to the perfect 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 suspension components already in the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.769
 production school 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.690
 and then of course the adjustments for 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.230
 the customers accordingly too 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.230
 optimize 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.610
 there is a good example for testing 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.160
 touratech suspend we have this for 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.260
 the ore mountain 20 that is built up with it 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.730
 the prologue did not start up like that 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.040
 bad second class we were 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.650
 third and fifth from i believe 80 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.970
 start second class again here 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.010
 Of course, a good one has been important 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.680
 landing gear also with over 180 otter 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.120
 but extreme example still works 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.870
 again just one example of how 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.820
 we test 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.180
 the focus is on touratech suspension 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.590
 Of course, on the long-distance journey 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.080
 of course, feather legs develop easily 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.730
 in the rally area or in the race area 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.810
 but of course the topic is long-distance travel 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.270
 for us the most important in the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.380
 Creation of the suspension components of the 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.330
 to win the one at the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.600
 has suspension components on safety 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.480
 on traction 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.850
 simply working out is simply not 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.220
 simply in focus that is on long 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.830
 traveling where I am in difficult terrain 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.960
 changing weather conditions with 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.870
 the corresponding luggage just that 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.610
 perfect suspension needs to reach over 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.370
 textes people carefully and helps 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.370
 ultimately to the perfect suspension 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.110
 before us, ethiopia travel went for tura 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.210
 tech's cooperation with the company 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.610
 track texas people in holland 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.460
 we really have the first one here 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.740
 completely out of tested driver now in there 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.020
 this is a spring leg what all 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.470
 has options and what 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.320
 especially at touratech of ours 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.330
 We have been voted on 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.100
 have very very long test phases in the 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.340
 shot the load with no load 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.070
 I did not travel on any trip 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.190
 ever a landing gear in my motorcycle 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.740
 it was confident all load-states 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.190
 all duties conditions the sand the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.430
 temperatures also range from 4,000 to 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.160
 minus 140 meters has compensated so 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.020
 The landing gear was absolutely never on 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.660
 his limits i had so the first one 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.660
 never piercing 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.660
 spring elements 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.580
 because
