been really keen to get our hands on a

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.810 
been really keen to get our hands on a
final<00:00:29.050> production<00:00:29.260> sample<00:00:29.650> here<00:00:30.430> it<00:00:30.520> is<00:00:30.640> and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
final production sample here it is and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.519 
final production sample here it is and
the<00:00:30.880> first<00:00:31.029> thing<00:00:31.240> you<00:00:31.330> notice<00:00:31.509> is<00:00:32.050> the<00:00:32.290> very

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
the first thing you notice is the very

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.549 
the first thing you notice is the very
classic<00:00:33.190> retro<00:00:33.580> design<00:00:34.090> used<00:00:34.420> here<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:35.140> let's

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
classic retro design used here so let's

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.770 
classic retro design used here so let's
take<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:35.770> closer<00:00:36.070> look<00:00:36.160> at<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.480> now<00:00:37.600> getting

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
take a closer look at it so now getting

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.240 
take a closer look at it so now getting
away<00:00:37.960> from<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.230> fact<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.650> engineers<00:00:39.100> at

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
away from the fact that the engineers at

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.890 
away from the fact that the engineers at
fuji<00:00:39.550> film<00:00:39.670> were<00:00:39.820> taking<00:00:40.120> inspiration<00:00:40.449> from

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
fuji film were taking inspiration from

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.410 
fuji film were taking inspiration from
the<00:00:41.620> classical<00:00:42.190> rangefinder<00:00:42.790> cameras<00:00:43.210> like

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
the classical rangefinder cameras like

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.320 
the classical rangefinder cameras like
the<00:00:43.600> Leica<00:00:43.840> M<00:00:44.379> series<00:00:44.980> but<00:00:45.879> it's<00:00:46.059> really

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
the Leica M series but it's really

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.910 
the Leica M series but it's really
successful<00:00:46.989> even<00:00:47.260> though<00:00:47.350> it's<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.500> compact

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
successful even though it's a compact

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.979 
successful even though it's a compact
camera<00:00:48.100> it's<00:00:48.400> got<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:48.550> lovely<00:00:48.820> feel<00:00:49.239> this<00:00:49.780> is<00:00:49.960> a

camera it's got a lovely feel this is a

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.139 
camera it's got a lovely feel this is a
die<00:00:50.380> cast<00:00:50.680> magnesium<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:51.730> gives<00:00:51.880> really

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
die cast magnesium so it gives really

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.560

doubt<00:01:18.280> soon<00:01:18.820> as<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.000> pick<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.300> x100<00:01:19.899> up

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
doubt soon as you pick the x100 up

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.690 
doubt soon as you pick the x100 up
you're<00:01:20.500> dealing<00:01:20.800> with<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:20.979> precision<00:01:21.460> of

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
you're dealing with the precision of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.670 
you're dealing with the precision of
photographic<00:01:22.299> tool<00:01:22.570> it's<00:01:22.869> a<00:01:22.960> lovely<00:01:23.229> camera

fantastic<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.640> moving<00:01:28.180> on<00:01:28.299> what<00:01:28.540> are<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.869> main

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
fantastic so moving on what are the main

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.289 
fantastic so moving on what are the main
features<00:01:29.320> have<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:29.979> got<00:01:30.130> here<00:01:30.310> well<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.150> next

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
features have we got here well the next

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.050 
features have we got here well the next
one<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.720> this<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.619> hybrid<00:01:33.130> viewfinder<00:01:33.850> it's

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
one is this the hybrid viewfinder it's

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.230 
one is this the hybrid viewfinder it's
got<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> clever<00:01:34.680> electronic<00:01:35.680> optical

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
got a clever electronic optical

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.359 
got a clever electronic optical
viewfinder<00:01:37.240> combination<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.439> let's<00:01:39.070> see<00:01:39.220> how

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
viewfinder combination so let's see how

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.679 
viewfinder combination so let's see how
that<00:01:39.549> works<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.430> moment<00:01:42.549> with<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.939> x100

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
that works at the moment with the x100

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.570 
that works at the moment with the x100
i'm<00:01:43.780> using<00:01:43.960> their<00:01:44.259> optical<00:01:44.770> viewfinder<00:01:45.460> which

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
i'm using their optical viewfinder which

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.730 
i'm using their optical viewfinder which
is<00:01:45.700> got<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.909> 90<00:01:46.360> percent<00:01:46.450> coverage<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.590> it's

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
is got a 90 percent coverage and it's

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.710 
is got a 90 percent coverage and it's
overlaid<00:01:48.159> with<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.549> load<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.729> digital<00:01:49.299> shooting

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
overlaid with a load of digital shooting

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.230 
overlaid with a load of digital shooting
information<00:01:50.320> they<00:01:50.920> then<00:01:51.159> simply<00:01:51.670> use<00:01:51.909> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
information they then simply use the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.050 
information they then simply use the
viewfinder<00:01:52.840> selector<00:01:53.770> switch<00:01:54.040> mounted<00:01:54.970> on

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
viewfinder selector switch mounted on

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.520 
viewfinder selector switch mounted on
the<00:01:55.180> front<00:01:55.299> of<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.509> camera<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.990> select<00:01:56.290> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the front of the camera to select the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.830 
the front of the camera to select the
EVF<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:58.180> I've<00:01:58.450> now<00:01:58.630> got<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:59.020> fully<00:01:59.500> digital

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
EVF so I've now got a fully digital

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.969 
EVF so I've now got a fully digital
display<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.290> same<00:02:02.500> shooting

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
display with the same shooting

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.160

those two as I shoot so you can see the

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.630 
those two as I shoot so you can see the
viewfinder<00:02:11.200> changed<00:02:11.980> at<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.220> moment<00:02:12.459> I'm<00:02:12.549> an

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
viewfinder changed at the moment I'm an

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.140 
viewfinder changed at the moment I'm an
optical<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:14.290> I'll<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.530> back<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.890> EVF<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
optical and I'll go back to EVF it's a

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
optical and I'll go back to EVF it's a
really<00:02:16.540> clever<00:02:16.720> system<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:17.950> really

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
really clever system and I'm really

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.580 
really clever system and I'm really
impressed<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.880> optical<00:02:19.450> viewfinder<00:02:20.140> is

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
impressed the optical viewfinder is

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.880 
impressed the optical viewfinder is
great<00:02:21.130> for<00:02:21.760> being<00:02:22.000> on<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.180> move<00:02:22.360> while<00:02:22.570> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
great for being on the move while the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.140 
great for being on the move while the
electronic<00:02:23.890> viewfinder<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.640> found<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.060> I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
electronic viewfinder I found that I

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150 
electronic viewfinder I found that I
used<00:02:25.329> quite<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.660> bit<00:02:25.870> even<00:02:26.530> though<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.860> had<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
used quite a bit even though I had the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.089 
used quite a bit even though I had the
optical<00:02:27.580> option

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.449 

so<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.810> x100s<00:02:32.469> excellent<00:02:33.069> high<00:02:33.219> road

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
so that is the x100s excellent high road

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.149 
so that is the x100s excellent high road
viewfinder<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.689> a<00:02:34.780> brilliant<00:02:35.260> system<00:02:35.499> no

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
viewfinder it's a brilliant system no

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.160 
viewfinder it's a brilliant system no
great<00:02:36.370> inclusion<00:02:36.849> on<00:02:36.939> this<00:02:37.090> camera<00:02:37.329> but<00:02:38.049> it's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
great inclusion on this camera but it's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.739 
great inclusion on this camera but it's
only<00:02:38.379> as<00:02:38.590> good<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:39.489> images<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.969> takes<00:02:40.269> so

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:40.749 
only as good as the images it takes so

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.110 
only as good as the images it takes so
the<00:02:40.900> question<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.349> can<00:02:42.069> we<00:02:42.129> x100<00:02:42.730> take<00:02:42.879> a<00:02:42.909> good

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
the question is can we x100 take a good

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.190 
the question is can we x100 take a good
picture<00:02:43.329> this<00:02:43.870> can't<00:02:44.109> find<00:02:44.319> out

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.760 

the<00:02:49.740> x100<00:02:50.430> uses<00:02:50.880> an<00:02:51.030> aps-c<00:02:51.540> size<00:02:52.020> sensor<00:02:52.050> so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
the x100 uses an aps-c size sensor so

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.010 
the x100 uses an aps-c size sensor so
similar<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> many<00:02:53.550> deer<00:02:53.819> solarz<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.840> got<00:02:54.989> a
