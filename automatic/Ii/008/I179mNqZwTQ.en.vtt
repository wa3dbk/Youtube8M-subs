from<00:01:09.420> johnny<00:01:09.780> says<00:01:10.400> that<00:01:11.400> music<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.330> enhance

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
from johnny says that music can enhance

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.200 
from johnny says that music can enhance
oxygen<00:01:13.470> capacity<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.280> blood<00:01:14.520> by<00:01:15.150> two

oxygen capacity of blood by two

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.260 
oxygen capacity of blood by two
mechanism<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.280> effect<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.909> breathing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
mechanism one is the effect on breathing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.010 
mechanism one is the effect on breathing
rate<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.460> another<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> relaxation

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
rate and another one is the relaxation

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.010 
rate and another one is the relaxation
effect<00:01:22.189> when<00:01:23.189> few<00:01:23.490> muscles<00:01:24.030> cancel<00:01:24.450> oxygen

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
effect when few muscles cancel oxygen

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.450 
effect when few muscles cancel oxygen
and<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:26.580> increases<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.979> oxygen<00:01:28.979> capacity

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and this increases the oxygen capacity

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
and this increases the oxygen capacity
of<00:01:29.939> blood<00:01:30.150> locally<00:01:30.979> for<00:01:31.979> those<00:01:32.780> muscles<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
of blood locally for those muscles that

of blood locally for those muscles that
do<00:01:34.439> their<00:01:34.710> job<00:01:35.570> while<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> Atlantis<00:01:37.290> women

yourself<00:02:37.050> they<00:02:38.050> are<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:39.010> interview<00:02:39.400> is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
yourself they are the interview is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.530 
yourself they are the interview is
called<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.959> psychology<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:41.980> speed<00:02:42.540> but

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
called like the psychology of speed but

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.300 
called like the psychology of speed but
it<00:02:43.600> would<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.780> psychology<00:02:44.560> unless<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.280> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
it would be psychology unless it is a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.479 
it would be psychology unless it is a
doping<00:02:45.760> by<00:02:46.570> listen<00:02:46.900> music<00:02:47.140> at<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> swimming

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
doping by listen music at the swimming

doping by listen music at the swimming
pool<00:02:48.730> deck<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.180> minute<00:02:49.959> before<00:02:50.170> the

competition so another evidence came

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.500 
competition so another evidence came
from<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.040> research<00:02:54.310> done<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.580> human<00:02:55.030> infants
