right now has a core i7 which is not

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.960 
right now has a core i7 which is not

graphics card which is low-end and three

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
graphics card which is low-end and three
gigs<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.000> RAM<00:00:21.180> which<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.390> pretty<00:00:21.720> standard<00:00:21.990> now

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
gigs of RAM which is pretty standard now

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.460

the<00:00:23.310> Intel<00:00:23.609> 4080<00:00:24.420> graphics<00:00:24.990> card<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the Intel 4080 graphics card is the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
the Intel 4080 graphics card is the
equivalent<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:27.320> nvidia<00:00:28.670> 8000<00:00:29.670> 9000

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
equivalent of your nvidia 8000 9000

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
equivalent of your nvidia 8000 9000
series<00:00:30.570> graphics<00:00:31.260> card<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.769> pretty<00:00:32.009> old

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
series graphics card so it's pretty old

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.049 
series graphics card so it's pretty old
um<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:33.710> don't<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.610> grade<00:00:35.880> on

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
um I don't know what it is for grade on

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.690 
um I don't know what it is for grade on
maybe<00:00:36.660> about<00:00:36.780> 5,000<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.620> could<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.280> wrong<00:00:38.460> don't

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
maybe about 5,000 I could be wrong don't

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.450 
maybe about 5,000 I could be wrong don't
hold<00:00:38.850> me<00:00:38.940> tell<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> um<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.309> let's<00:00:41.309> get

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
hold me tell you that um now let's get

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520 
hold me tell you that um now let's get
into<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
into this right now if we go to the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
into this right now if we go to the
graphics<00:00:43.980> I'll<00:00:44.190> show<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.149> running

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
graphics I'll show you what I'm running

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.319 
graphics I'll show you what I'm running
I<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:46.110> medium<00:00:46.920> specs<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> low

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I have medium specs on I have a low

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.709 
I have medium specs on I have a low
resolution<00:00:49.100> aspect<00:00:50.100> ratio<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:51.180> things<00:00:51.449> off

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
resolution aspect ratio these things off

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
resolution aspect ratio these things off
so<00:00:53.510> basically<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.690> running<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:55.520> mid<00:00:56.520> level

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so basically I'm running like mid level

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.290 
so basically I'm running like mid level
graphics<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.109> real<00:00:58.530> low<00:00:58.710> resolution<00:00:59.460> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
graphics with a real low resolution it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.790 
graphics with a real low resolution it's
running<00:01:00.600> fine<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.170> now<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.440> running<00:01:01.710> at

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
running fine right now I'm running at

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.969 
running fine right now I'm running at
about<00:01:01.980> 30<00:01:02.340> fps<00:01:03.080> if<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> didn't<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.680> fraps

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
about 30 fps if I didn't have fraps

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250 
about 30 fps if I didn't have fraps
running<00:01:05.369> you'd<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:06.180> faster<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
running you'd be going faster there you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.280 
running you'd be going faster there you
know<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:07.950> go<00:01:08.070> there's<00:01:08.250> some<00:01:08.400> lag<00:01:08.610> shit

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
know there we go there's some lag shit

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.370 
know there we go there's some lag shit
what<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.560> um<00:01:10.770> anyways<00:01:11.900> yeah<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.200> as

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
what do you know um anyways yeah so as

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
what do you know um anyways yeah so as
you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.100> bit<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> lag<00:01:14.490> right

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you can see a little bit of lag right

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
you can see a little bit of lag right
now<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.330> some<00:01:15.780> reason<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.409> running<00:01:16.710> fine

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
now for some reason it was running fine

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.370 
now for some reason it was running fine
before<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.850> could<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.210> fraps<00:01:18.509> let's<00:01:19.170> try

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
before this could be fraps let's try

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.530 
before this could be fraps let's try
lowering<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> graphics<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.570 

all<00:01:26.020> right<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.320> here<00:01:26.500> we<00:01:26.620> are<00:01:26.650> back<00:01:26.920> at<00:01:27.130> 30fps

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
all right and here we are back at 30fps

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.940 
all right and here we are back at 30fps
as<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.600> can<00:01:28.750> see<00:01:28.900> with<00:01:29.020> low<00:01:29.200> graphics<00:01:29.710> game

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
as you can see with low graphics game

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.850 
as you can see with low graphics game
doesn't<00:01:30.430> look<00:01:30.460> amazing<00:01:31.120> but<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.900> runs<00:01:32.470> it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
doesn't look amazing but it runs it

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.090 
doesn't look amazing but it runs it
works<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:34.870> definitely<00:01:35.590> recommend<00:01:35.830> getting

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
works and I definitely recommend getting

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.670 
works and I definitely recommend getting
it<00:01:36.370> if<00:01:36.610> you're<00:01:36.880> on<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:38.110> fence<00:01:38.260> about<00:01:38.560> whether

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
it if you're on the fence about whether

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.680 
it if you're on the fence about whether
or<00:01:39.070> not<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.430> will<00:01:39.490> run<00:01:39.700> on<00:01:39.730> your<00:01:39.970> computer<00:01:40.540> if

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
or not it will run on your computer if

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.180 
or not it will run on your computer if
you<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:40.960> run<00:01:41.080> on<00:01:41.230> mine<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.530> can<00:01:41.620> probably<00:01:41.920> run

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
you can run on mine it can probably run

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.920 
you can run on mine it can probably run

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.910 
intel 3000 HD I'd probably put the 4000
it's<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.700> low<00:01:51.880> end<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.180> things<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.770> give
