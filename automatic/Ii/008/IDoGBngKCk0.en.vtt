00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
straight cut come over to this inside

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.190 
straight cut come over to this inside
corner<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.640> we've<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.420> corners<00:01:09.900> up

above here that are at 135 degrees both
those<00:01:14.970> corners<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.900> cut<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.259> 22<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.890> 1/2

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
those corners would be cut at 22 and 1/2

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.630 
those corners would be cut at 22 and 1/2
to<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.000> turn<00:01:19.040> steps<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.310> down

another straight cut comes back over

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
another straight cut comes back over
cabinet<00:01:25.650> above<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> stove<00:01:26.280> bumps<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
cabinet above the stove bumps out it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
cut up above another 90 degree turn

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.859 
cut up above another 90 degree turn
that's<00:01:34.320> two<00:01:34.799> cuts<00:01:35.159> made<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> 45<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.689> make

that's two cuts made out of 45 to make

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.760 
that's two cuts made out of 45 to make
that<00:01:38.000> comes<00:01:39.000> across<00:01:40.250> returns<00:01:41.250> back<00:01:41.610> again

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
that comes across returns back again

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.260 
that comes across returns back again
then<00:01:43.770> you've<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> cabinet<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.000> 12

butts<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:50.030> 15

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
butts into this one that's it's 15

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
butts into this one that's it's 15
inches<00:01:51.329> deep<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:52.799> comes<00:01:53.130> across<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.200> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
inches deep that comes across and it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.560 
inches deep that comes across and it
dumps<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.369> refrigerator<00:01:56.790> panel<00:01:57.329> now

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
dumps into this refrigerator panel now

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
dumps into this refrigerator panel now
this<00:01:57.780> frigerator<00:01:58.259> panel<00:01:58.740> has<00:01:58.950> a<00:02:00.710> quarter<00:02:01.710> inch

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this frigerator panel has a quarter inch

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.310 
this frigerator panel has a quarter inch
style<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.439> make<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.009> cut<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:06.659> need

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
style on it so to make this cut you need

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.180 
style on it so to make this cut you need
to<00:02:07.590> notch<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:09.239> rail<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.679> so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to notch this rail out here so

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.020 
to notch this rail out here so
crown<00:02:11.460> sits<00:02:11.790> back<00:02:12.000> against<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.570> panel<00:02:13.050> and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
crown sits back against this panel and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.360 
crown sits back against this panel and
then<00:02:15.030> that's<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.330> 90<00:02:15.660> degree<00:02:15.960> cut<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.500> well<00:02:16.650> both

then that's a 90 degree cut as well both
cuts<00:02:17.730> made<00:02:17.970> out<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.240> 45<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:20.130> finally<00:02:20.820> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
cuts made out of 45 and then finally it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.560 
cuts made out of 45 and then finally it
comes<00:02:21.450> over<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:23.040> dumps<00:02:23.850> into<00:02:24.300> this

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570
