sorta<00:02:52.150> what's<00:02:53.150> good<00:02:53.480> when<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.230> see<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.620> in<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
sorta what's good when you see it in the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.460 
sorta what's good when you see it in the
Nexus<00:02:57.170> or<00:02:57.790> skyrim<00:02:58.790> nexus

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.810 

so<00:03:04.280> there's<00:03:04.820> three<00:03:05.210> of<00:03:05.300> them

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.990 

fear<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:08.850> them<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.360> kind<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.750> looks<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:11.000> don't

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
fear of them that kind of looks I don't

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.510 
fear of them that kind of looks I don't
know<00:03:12.110> old-style<00:03:13.940> cinematic<00:03:15.890> suppose<00:03:16.890> they

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
know old-style cinematic suppose they

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.750 
know old-style cinematic suppose they
got<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.090> hint<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.840> brew<00:03:19.610> brown<00:03:20.870> blue<00:03:21.870> ish

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
got a hint of a brew brown blue ish

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.790 
got a hint of a brew brown blue ish
color<00:03:23.760> some<00:03:24.360> sort<00:03:25.370> not<00:03:26.370> exactly<00:03:26.850> sure<00:03:27.800> what

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
color some sort not exactly sure what

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.540 
color some sort not exactly sure what
would<00:03:28.950> call<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.780> other<00:03:31.710> than<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.040> it's

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
would call it but other than that it's

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.430 
would call it but other than that it's
the<00:03:32.730> same<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.500> two<00:03:34.500> others<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:34.920> has<00:03:36.440> well

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the same and two others that has well

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.830 
the same and two others that has well
basically<00:03:37.680> one<00:03:38.160> other<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.940> has<00:03:41.000> more<00:03:42.000> light

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
basically one other that has more light

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.190 
basically one other that has more light
in<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.970 

so<00:03:47.200> what<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.860> sun<00:03:48.160> will<00:03:49.800> be<00:03:50.800> more<00:03:51.040> strongly

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
so what the sun will be more strongly

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.970 
so what the sun will be more strongly
lit<00:03:53.980> up<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.780> don't<00:03:55.780> know<00:03:55.870> more<00:03:56.080> about<00:03:56.140> objects

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
lit up I don't know more about objects

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.420 
lit up I don't know more about objects
and<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.340> on<00:03:57.520> I<00:03:57.820> haven't<00:03:58.210> really<00:03:58.570> tested<00:03:58.750> it

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
and so on I haven't really tested it

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.910 
and so on I haven't really tested it
that<00:04:03.210> but<00:04:04.210> i<00:04:04.240> can<00:04:04.630> say<00:04:04.840> i'm<00:04:04.990> using<00:04:05.410> balanced

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
that but i can say i'm using balanced

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.070 
that but i can say i'm using balanced
and<00:04:06.130> as<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.520> can<00:04:06.730> see<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:07.240> perfectly

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
and as you can see it's perfectly

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.610 
and as you can see it's perfectly
balanced<00:04:09.010> if<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.280> ask<00:04:09.460> me<00:04:09.960> light<00:04:10.960> looks<00:04:11.350> good

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
balanced if you ask me light looks good

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.470 
balanced if you ask me light looks good
