they're<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> nice<00:00:54.000> position<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.660> stasis

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
they're in a nice position to get stasis

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
they're in a nice position to get stasis
and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.980> Cal<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.670> able<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> run<00:00:57.120> right

and then Cal will be able to run right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
and then Cal will be able to run right
underneath<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.649> well<00:00:58.800> before<00:00:59.160> there's

enough<00:00:59.670> energy<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.120> those<00:01:00.359> arbiters<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
enough energy for those arbiters to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
enough energy for those arbiters to
stasis<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.410> still<00:01:01.649> he's<00:01:02.129> gonna<00:01:02.309> have

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
stasis but still he's gonna have

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.130 
stasis but still he's gonna have
arbiters<00:01:03.270> outside<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.629> base<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.989> that

arbiters outside his base with that
cloaking<00:01:04.729> he's<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.000> once<00:01:06.180> again

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.520 
out yet and now yeah not even two more
factories<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.080> Cal's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
factories up and as you can see Cal's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.980 
factories up and as you can see Cal's
already<00:01:22.890> pumping<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.700> several<00:01:24.299> gateways

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
already pumping out of several gateways

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.120 
already pumping out of several gateways
i<00:01:25.020> wish<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:25.290> could<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> count<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.009> he's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
i wish i could get a count here he's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.710 
i wish i could get a count here he's
already<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.460> i<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:27.060> four<00:01:27.299> gateways<00:01:27.479> up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
already got i think four gateways up

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.149 
already got i think four gateways up
he's<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:27.960> three<00:01:28.200> more<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.740> sorry<00:01:29.040> he

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
he's got three more going down sorry he

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.859 
he's got three more going down sorry he
has<00:01:29.280> five<00:01:29.520> gateways<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.240> three<00:01:30.750> more

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
has five gateways up and three more

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
has five gateways up and three more
going<00:01:31.110> down<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> total<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> eight<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
going down so for a total of eight and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.280 
going down so for a total of eight and
he's<00:01:33.270> also<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.810> robotics<00:01:34.200> facility

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
he's also got that robotics facility

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
he's also got that robotics facility
along<00:01:34.710> side<00:01:34.950> there's<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.400> arbiter

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
along side there's that first arbiter

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.249 
along side there's that first arbiter
and<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.270> push<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.689> immediately<00:01:36.960> now

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and he can just push up immediately now

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
and he can just push up immediately now
and<00:01:37.500> still<00:01:38.310> still<00:01:38.700> there's<00:01:38.880> comps<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.270> out

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and still still there's comps at out

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
and still still there's comps at out
there<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.259> he's<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.799> gonna<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:40.979> able<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> end

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
there so he's not gonna be able to end

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.530 
there so he's not gonna be able to end
it<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.820> he's<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> make<00:01:42.270> sure<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it here but he's going to make sure that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
it here but he's going to make sure that
he<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.930> basically<00:01:43.200> win<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> long<00:01:43.890> game

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
he can basically win the long game

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
he can basically win the long game
kannada<00:01:44.759> realizing<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.390> he's<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> try

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
kannada realizing it he's going to try

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
kannada realizing it he's going to try
to<00:01:45.930> float<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> command<00:01:46.619> center<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.549> i

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to float a command center out to that i

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
to float a command center out to that i
think<00:01:47.970> there's<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.329> island<00:01:48.720> expansion<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.380> six

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
think there's a island expansion at six

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
think there's a island expansion at six
o'clock<00:01:49.680> location<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.329> man

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
o'clock location but that's really man

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.889 
o'clock location but that's really man
you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.670> arbiter<00:01:54.210> recall<00:01:54.600> right

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you can you can arbiter recall right

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.359 
you can you can arbiter recall right
into<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.860> why<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> lot<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
into that which is I think why a lot of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.100 
into that which is I think why a lot of
Protoss<00:01:56.670> players<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> arbiters

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
Protoss players go with the arbiters

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.389 
Protoss players go with the arbiters
here<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.710> recall<00:01:59.070> advantage

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
here is just for that recall advantage

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.950 
here is just for that recall advantage
looks<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.700> weapons<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.780> ones

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
looks like weapons one or are more ones

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.330 
looks like weapons one or are more ones
being<00:02:01.200> researched<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:01.890> might

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
being researched right there might

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.760 
being researched right there might
already<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.610> weapons<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.409> not<00:02:04.409> saying<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
already have weapons one not saying it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.859 
already have weapons one not saying it
actually<00:02:05.100> again<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.729> poor<00:02:06.090> video

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
actually again because poor video

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.359 
actually again because poor video
quality<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> moment<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.069> because<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
quality at the moment just because the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
quality at the moment just because the
lamb<00:02:08.580> viewing<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.270> commentating

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
lamb viewing it for commentating

lamb viewing it for commentating
purposes<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.400> another<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.700> arbiter<00:02:12.000> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
purposes and another more arbiter just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.660 
purposes and another more arbiter just
being<00:02:12.360> pumped<00:02:12.629> out<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.140> starting

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
being pumped out now it's starting

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.370 
being pumped out now it's starting
this<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> first<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.840> vultures<00:02:15.080> we're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this is the first for vultures we're

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.839 
this is the first for vultures we're
seeing<00:02:15.530> coming<00:02:15.740> out<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> conatus<00:02:16.310> base<00:02:16.459> one

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
seeing coming out of conatus base one

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.130 
seeing coming out of conatus base one
getting<00:02:17.090> picked<00:02:17.300> off<00:02:17.420> which<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:17.959> hurts

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
getting picked off which just hurts

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900 
getting picked off which just hurts
they're<00:02:18.500> not<00:02:18.650> even<00:02:18.860> speed<00:02:19.099> upgraded<00:02:19.489> think

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
they're not even speed upgraded think

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.420 
they're not even speed upgraded think
they<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.090> spider<00:02:20.360> mines<00:02:20.540> as<00:02:20.810> well<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.430> yeah

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
they have spider mines as well and yeah

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.920 
they have spider mines as well and yeah
arbiters<00:02:22.970> already<00:02:23.239> out<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.510> field<00:02:23.690> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
arbiters already out in the field and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.270 
arbiters already out in the field and
you<00:02:24.080> need<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.349> have<00:02:24.500> mines<00:02:24.739> all<00:02:24.950> over<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you need to have mines all over the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.500 
you need to have mines all over the
place<00:02:25.430> at<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.670> point<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.030> some<00:02:26.270> sort<00:02:26.420> of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
place at this point I have some sort of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.970 
place at this point I have some sort of
contain<00:02:26.840> maybe<00:02:27.050> some<00:02:27.260> turrets<00:02:27.560> outside<00:02:27.860> of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
contain maybe some turrets outside of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.460 
contain maybe some turrets outside of
space<00:02:28.160> at<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.940> point<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.330> really<00:02:29.630> have<00:02:30.380> an

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
space at this point to really have an

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.260 
space at this point to really have an
advantage<00:02:30.800> here<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.730> anyway

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
advantage here and I just of anyway

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.190 
advantage here and I just of anyway
we'll<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.660> looks<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.900> he's<00:02:33.020> going<00:02:33.140> to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
we'll see it looks like he's going to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.150 
we'll see it looks like he's going to
try<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.380> float<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.709> out<00:02:33.770> there<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.069> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
try to float it out there to that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.190 
try to float it out there to that
mineral<00:02:34.489> expansion<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.080> can<00:02:36.170> see

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
mineral expansion and as you can see

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.660 
mineral expansion and as you can see
dragoons<00:02:36.709> already<00:02:37.040> waiting<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.430> actually

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
dragoons already waiting and actually

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.920 
dragoons already waiting and actually
think<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:37.970> was<00:02:38.090> thinking<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.480> different<00:02:38.540> map

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
a recall and it as well looks like there

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.400 
a recall and it as well looks like there
is<00:05:16.310> another<00:05:16.640> arbiter<00:05:17.030> waiting<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.960> standby

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
is another arbiter waiting and standby

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.720 
is another arbiter waiting and standby
to<00:05:18.470> do<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> same<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.220> looks<00:05:19.400> like<00:05:19.460> those

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
to do the same and it looks like those

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.980 
to do the same and it looks like those
group<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.120> way<00:05:20.330> those<00:05:20.510> are<00:05:20.540> grouped<00:05:20.840> I'm

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
group that the way those are grouped I'm

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.970 
group that the way those are grouped I'm
going<00:05:21.140> to<00:05:21.200> assume<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.680> going<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.890> be

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
going to assume that this is going to be

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.210 
going to assume that this is going to be
another<00:05:22.130> recall<00:05:22.490> incoming<00:05:22.910> momentarily<00:05:24.220> and

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
another recall incoming momentarily and

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.580 
another recall incoming momentarily and
showing<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.120> expansions<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:26.750> right<00:05:27.440> now

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
showing the expansions and right now

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.830 
showing the expansions and right now
yeah<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:27.950> looks<00:05:28.250> like<00:05:28.370> kannada<00:05:29.330> did<00:05:29.540> manage<00:05:29.750> to

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
yeah it looks like kannada did manage to

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.090 
yeah it looks like kannada did manage to
get<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:29.990> decent<00:05:30.170> sized<00:05:30.440> force<00:05:30.650> he<00:05:30.800> does<00:05:30.920> have<00:05:31.070> a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
get a decent sized force he does have a

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.860 
get a decent sized force he does have a
decent<00:05:31.400> sized<00:05:31.520> force<00:05:31.700> at<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.030> secondary<00:05:32.360> that

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
decent sized force at the secondary that

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.810 
decent sized force at the secondary that
harbored<00:05:33.230> are<00:05:33.320> starting<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.620> attack<00:05:34.130> just<00:05:34.670> out

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
harbored are starting to attack just out

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.310 
harbored are starting to attack just out
in<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:34.970> field<00:05:35.180> where<00:05:35.420> it<00:05:35.510> can<00:05:35.720> just<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.200> be

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
in the field where it can just to be

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.590 
in the field where it can just to be
annoying<00:05:37.040> as<00:05:37.310> possible<00:05:37.760> not<00:05:38.210> letting<00:05:38.510> the

annoying as possible not letting the

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.240 
annoying as possible not letting the
turrets<00:05:38.840> go<00:05:38.990> out<00:05:39.110> but<00:05:39.260> maybe<00:05:39.710> that'll<00:05:40.040> force

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
turrets go out but maybe that'll force

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.800 
turrets go out but maybe that'll force

another arbiter pushing in it's going to

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.760 
another arbiter pushing in it's going to
make<00:05:43.670> it<00:05:43.820> Oh<00:05:44.000> making<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.810> back<00:05:44.930> past<00:05:45.500> hurts

make it Oh making it back past hurts
it's<00:05:45.920> going<00:05:46.040> to<00:05:46.100> die<00:05:46.190> momentarily<00:05:46.640> though<00:05:46.880> but

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
it's going to die momentarily though but

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.790 
it's going to die momentarily though but
that's<00:05:47.630> going<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.840> bring<00:05:48.170> another<00:05:48.380> force<00:05:48.650> and

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
that's going to bring another force and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.670 
that's going to bring another force and
I<00:05:48.860> think<00:05:49.510> wow<00:05:50.510> armor<00:05:51.140> you<00:05:51.200> going<00:05:51.320> to<00:05:51.380> go<00:05:51.470> down

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
I think wow armor you going to go down

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.440 
I think wow armor you going to go down
as<00:05:51.920> well<00:05:52.070> as<00:05:52.310> decent<00:05:52.880> Mountain<00:05:53.060> supply<00:05:53.270> those

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
as well as decent Mountain supply those

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.910 
as well as decent Mountain supply those
tanks<00:05:53.720> going<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:53.900> have<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.170> unseat<00:05:54.560> go<00:05:54.770> back

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
tanks going to have to unseat go back

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.320 
tanks going to have to unseat go back
and<00:05:55.190> now<00:05:55.340> we're<00:05:55.520> seeing<00:05:55.640> that<00:05:55.820> one-two<00:05:56.090> punch

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
and now we're seeing that one-two punch

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
that I was expecting a little bit

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.290 
that I was expecting a little bit
earlier<00:05:57.650> going<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.400> go<00:05:58.490> across<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:58.880> front<00:05:59.150> as
