00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
we fold number three damn and then you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.620 
we fold number three damn and then you
count<00:03:15.840> four<00:03:16.320> across<00:03:17.130> on<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> finger<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.170> one

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
count four across on the finger so one

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.370 
count four across on the finger so one
two<00:03:21.980> three<00:03:23.180> four<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:24.720> number<00:03:24.990> seven

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
two three four and that's number seven

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.010 
two three four and that's number seven
so<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.300> free<00:03:27.540> plus<00:03:27.780> four

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
so then you know that free plus four

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.020 
so then you know that free plus four
equals<00:03:28.560> 7<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:30.780> do<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.960> subtraction<00:03:31.460> start<00:03:32.460> like

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
equals 7 to do a subtraction start like

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.320 
equals 7 to do a subtraction start like
nine<00:03:33.330> minus<00:03:33.720> two<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.950> now<00:03:35.070> at<00:03:35.250> number<00:03:35.430> nine<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
nine minus two so now at number nine and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.670 
nine minus two so now at number nine and
count<00:03:37.290> backwards<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.540> go<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:40.380> eight

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
count backwards so you go to eight

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.670 
count backwards so you go to eight
that's<00:03:41.250> your<00:03:41.460> number<00:03:41.580> one<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.330> then<00:03:42.810> again<00:03:43.350> to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
that's your number one and then again to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.800 
that's your number one and then again to
get<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:43.920> up<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.090> takes<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> seven

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
get it up to and that takes you to seven

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.230 
get it up to and that takes you to seven
so<00:03:46.500> nine<00:03:47.160> minus<00:03:47.520> 2<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.960> 7<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:50.640> then<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.030> can

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
so nine minus 2 is 7 and then you can

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.900 
so nine minus 2 is 7 and then you can
just<00:03:51.360> work<00:03:51.420> through<00:03:51.840> all<00:03:52.110> your<00:03:52.350> sums<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:53.100> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
just work through all your sums on the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.180 
just work through all your sums on the
fingers<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.570> all<00:03:54.660> your<00:03:54.780> answers<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:56.130> is

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
fingers and get all your answers this is

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.950 
fingers and get all your answers this is
a<00:03:56.340> great<00:03:56.610> game<00:03:56.880> practice<00:03:57.420> your<00:03:57.510> counting

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
a great game practice your counting

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.630 
a great game practice your counting
skills<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.770> do<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.160> pencil<00:03:59.370> you

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
skills and if you do it in pencil you

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.120 
skills and if you do it in pencil you
can<00:03:59.790> get<00:03:59.910> over<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.450> over<00:04:00.630> again<00:04:00.840> or<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:02.040> can

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
can get over and over again or you can

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.340 
can get over and over again or you can
