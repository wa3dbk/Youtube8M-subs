00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:27.950
The days I’d lost float before me. I cannot gather them together.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:42.930
Those muddied dreams, far distant, when I once laughed happily.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:57.920
If only “you” were here…

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.500
As I stand here all alone in my misery, what falls upon me

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.430
Is a pure white snow, its color a lie.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.780
Though now even my memories have rotten, fading away,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.500
They project as shadows in the darkness.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:56.710
I’ve lost the sun, and still know not where it is.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:11.590
Though I search, pitifully, I’ll never be the same again.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:26.570
…and I multiply…

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.130
Overwhelmed with jealousy and loneliness for myself, it turns me into something else.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.040
Hatred rains over me.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.420
The heavily sinking pure white is stained red with my tears

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.380
Leaving their mark here.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.060
I still want all of my love to reach “you”.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.960
Though even now I might break.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.340
The snow has already become pitch black, swallowing everything.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.640
-Everything- melts into darkness and disappears.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.700
These shadows forever beside me.
