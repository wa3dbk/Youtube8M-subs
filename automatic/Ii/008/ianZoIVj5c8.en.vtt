is<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> art<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.840> breaking<00:01:30.840> code<00:01:31.350> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
is the art of breaking code but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
is the art of breaking code but
basically<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.939> recreational

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
basically you can make it recreational

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
basically you can make it recreational
by<00:01:33.780> coming<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.590> simple<00:01:35.100> sentences

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
by coming up with some simple sentences

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
by coming up with some simple sentences
have<00:01:36.090> them<00:01:36.270> guess<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.049> kind<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> letters

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
have them guess at what kind of letters

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
have them guess at what kind of letters
might<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.400> behind<00:01:38.579> those<00:01:38.939> scrambled<00:01:39.299> letters

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
might be behind those scrambled letters

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
maybe teach the class for a little bit

maybe teach the class for a little bit
it<00:02:00.840> helps<00:02:01.439> students<00:02:02.250> perhaps<00:02:02.729> relate<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> math

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450

more<00:02:12.840> simply<00:02:13.110> because

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
more simply because

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.490 
more simply because
is<00:02:13.530> they<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:14.250> speak<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> same<00:02:15.120> levels<00:02:15.960> so

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
is they all speak on the same levels so
