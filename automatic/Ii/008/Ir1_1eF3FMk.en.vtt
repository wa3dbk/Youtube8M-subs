concealer<00:03:32.870> foundation<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:33.860> with<00:03:34.010> this

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
concealer foundation but with this

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.170 
concealer foundation but with this
foundation<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.090> does<00:03:35.540> increase<00:03:36.020> up<00:03:36.410> yeah

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
foundation it does increase up yeah

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.170 
foundation it does increase up yeah
there's<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:38.390> less<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.990> crease<00:03:39.200> m+<00:03:39.800> um<00:03:40.220> like

there's like less of a crease m+ um like

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.970 
there's like less of a crease m+ um like
for<00:03:41.360> concealers<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:42.050> hard<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.350> find<00:03:42.590> my<00:03:42.710> tone

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
for concealers it's hard to find my tone

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.190 
for concealers it's hard to find my tone
and<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.520> one<00:03:43.730> works<00:03:44.030> perfectly<00:03:44.540> because<00:03:44.720> my

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
and this one works perfectly because my

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.530 
and this one works perfectly because my
whole<00:03:45.320> foundation<00:03:45.470> looks<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.610> same<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.060> so

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
whole foundation looks the same and so

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.240 
whole foundation looks the same and so
when<00:03:47.810> increases<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.320> doesn't<00:03:48.710> look<00:03:48.830> anything

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
when increases it doesn't look anything

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.800 
when increases it doesn't look anything
different<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.240> have<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.420> wipe<00:03:50.630> it

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
different like I just have to wipe it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.710
