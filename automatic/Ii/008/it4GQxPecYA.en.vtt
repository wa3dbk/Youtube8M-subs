we<00:00:01.979> have<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.300> gage<00:00:03.300> pot<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:04.580> trans<00:00:05.580> temp

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
we have the gage pot in trans temp

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.020 
we have the gage pot in trans temp
exhaust<00:00:07.560> gas<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.220> then<00:00:08.340> we<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> boost

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
exhaust gas and then we have the boost

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.570 
exhaust gas and then we have the boost
gauge<00:00:09.210> hanging<00:00:09.630> here<00:00:09.780> because<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.260> to

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
gauge hanging here because we have to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.490 
gauge hanging here because we have to
finalize<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.849> hookup<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.200> wires

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
finalize this hookup I have all my wires

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.860 
finalize this hookup I have all my wires
going<00:00:13.980> down<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.299> little<00:00:15.509> opening<00:00:15.809> there

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
going down in this little opening there

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.340 
going down in this little opening there
down<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.279> tie<00:00:17.460> them<00:00:17.699> off<00:00:18.350> I've

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
down here and to tie them off I've

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.189 
down here and to tie them off I've
already<00:00:19.619> hooked<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.960> exhaust<00:00:21.960> gas

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
already hooked up the exhaust gas

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.859 
already hooked up the exhaust gas
temperature<00:00:22.710> blue<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.400> pink<00:00:23.609> wire<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
temperature blue and pink wire so the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.450 
temperature blue and pink wire so the
exhaust<00:00:25.109> gas<00:00:25.410> temperature<00:00:25.890> gauge<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> pretty

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
exhaust gas temperature gauge is pretty

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.279 
exhaust gas temperature gauge is pretty
much<00:00:26.580> wired<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> trans<00:00:27.570> temp<00:00:27.869> gauge<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
much wired the trans temp gauge is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.769 
much wired the trans temp gauge is
pretty<00:00:28.529> much<00:00:28.650> wired<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.609> once<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.000> hook<00:00:30.179> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
pretty much wired and once I hook this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.569 
pretty much wired and once I hook this
in<00:00:31.080> boost<00:00:31.800> gauge<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.460> much<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:33.329> done

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
in boost gauge is pretty much all done

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.270 
in boost gauge is pretty much all done
then<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.820> got<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> run<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.360> power<00:00:36.600> source

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
then I just got to run my power source

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.190 
then I just got to run my power source
constant<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.670> switched<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> hook<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
constant and switched and hook up that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
constant and switched and hook up that
black<00:00:40.410> ground<00:00:40.649> wire<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.430> the

rotating<00:02:39.350> color<00:02:39.770> goes<00:02:40.610> from<00:02:40.760> one<00:02:40.910> color<00:02:41.150> to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
rotating color goes from one color to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:54.630 
rotating color goes from one color to
the<00:02:41.360> next

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.120 

now<00:02:55.270> we<00:02:55.330> got<00:02:55.510> them<00:02:55.570> all<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:56.170> fading<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.100> and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
now we got them all just fading in and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.070 
now we got them all just fading in and
out<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.490> going<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:57.820> different<00:02:57.910> colors<00:03:01.080> kind

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
out and going in different colors kind

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.510 
out and going in different colors kind
of<00:03:02.200> cool<00:03:02.380> when<00:03:02.500> we<00:03:02.590> park<00:03:02.830> at<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:02.980> trade<00:03:03.250> shows

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
of cool when we park at the trade shows

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.580 
of cool when we park at the trade shows
get<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.090> gauges<00:03:04.840> going<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.350> out<00:03:05.440> in

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
get the gauges going in and out in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:15.720 
get the gauges going in and out in
different<00:03:05.890> colors<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:14.100> get<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.220> red<00:03:15.430> color

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
different colors so get the red color

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.520 
different colors so get the red color
here<00:03:16.000> use<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.630> lot<00:03:16.780> for<00:03:17.050> night<00:03:17.260> driving

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
here use that a lot for night driving

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.440 
here use that a lot for night driving
we're<00:03:18.250> coming<00:03:18.610> through<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.880> mountains<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
we're coming through the mountains and

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.940 
we're coming through the mountains and
you<00:03:19.540> can't<00:03:19.780> see<00:03:19.990> nothing<00:03:20.140> because<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.680> so

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
you can't see nothing because it's so

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.900 
you can't see nothing because it's so
dark<00:03:21.250> outside

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
dark outside

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.740 
dark outside
the<00:03:22.510> red<00:03:22.720> color<00:03:23.020> really<00:03:23.410> doesn't<00:03:24.540> blind<00:03:25.540> you

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
the red color really doesn't blind you

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.330 
the red color really doesn't blind you
going<00:03:26.050> around<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> corners<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:26.950> stuff<00:03:27.190> like

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
going around the corners and stuff like

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.680 
going around the corners and stuff like
that<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.820> know<00:03:27.940> when<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.120> look<00:03:28.420> out<00:03:28.570> the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
that you know when you look out the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.830 
that you know when you look out the
corner<00:03:29.020> window<00:03:29.170> here<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.820> usually<00:03:31.420> leave<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.720> on

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
corner window here I usually leave it on

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.199 
corner window here I usually leave it on
this<00:03:31.959> color<00:03:32.260> right<00:03:32.470> here<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.790> seems<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.150> be

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
this color right here that seems to be

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.070 
this color right here that seems to be
this<00:03:34.390> pretty<00:03:34.840> much<00:03:35.050> closest<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.709> stock<00:03:35.980> uh<00:03:37.080> I

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
this pretty much closest to stock uh I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.990 
this pretty much closest to stock uh I
said<00:03:38.739> I'm<00:03:38.860> real<00:03:39.010> happy<00:03:39.130> with<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.550> glow<00:03:39.730> shift

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
said I'm real happy with the glow shift

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.870 
said I'm real happy with the glow shift
gauge<00:03:40.239> pack<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:41.130> really<00:03:42.130> like<00:03:42.280> their<00:03:42.459> products

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
gauge pack I really like their products

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.720 
gauge pack I really like their products
I<00:03:43.150> got<00:03:43.810> them<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.050> four<00:03:44.800> of<00:03:44.950> my<00:03:45.070> vehicles<00:03:45.520> right

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
I got them in four of my vehicles right

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.270 
I got them in four of my vehicles right
now<00:03:45.910> I've<00:03:46.360> only<00:03:46.720> had<00:03:46.900> one<00:03:47.200> issue<00:03:47.470> with<00:03:48.010> one

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
now I've only had one issue with one

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.449 
now I've only had one issue with one
gauge<00:03:48.550> and<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.540> just<00:03:49.810> think<00:03:50.050> it's<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:51.040> bad<00:03:51.220> gauge

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
gauge and I just think it's a bad gauge

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.130 
gauge and I just think it's a bad gauge
so<00:03:52.239> I'm<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.690> go<00:03:52.780> ahead<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.050> order

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
so I'm just going to go ahead and order

real happy with that transmission temp
on<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.380> Mustang<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.630> only<00:04:37.780> diesel

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
on the Mustang this is the only diesel

on the Mustang this is the only diesel
we<00:04:38.350> have<00:04:38.500> done<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:38.950> this<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.220> first<00:04:39.400> time

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
we have done so this is the first time

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.100 
we have done so this is the first time
we've<00:04:39.790> experimented<00:04:40.210> with<00:04:40.510> their<00:04:40.750> exhaust

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
we've experimented with their exhaust

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.710 
we've experimented with their exhaust
gas<00:04:41.410> temperature<00:04:42.010> probe<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.360> first<00:04:43.570> time

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
gas temperature probe and the first time

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.920 
gas temperature probe and the first time
we<00:04:43.840> played<00:04:44.200> with<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.410> boost<00:04:44.620> gauge<00:04:45.630> if<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.780> was

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
we played with the boost gauge if I was

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.840 
we played with the boost gauge if I was
do<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.229> all<00:04:47.350> over<00:04:47.380> again<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:48.130> wouldn't<00:04:48.729> have

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
do it all over again I wouldn't have

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.120 
do it all over again I wouldn't have

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
gotten the 60 pound boost gauge I

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.070 
gotten the 60 pound boost gauge I
thought<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:52.000> was<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.180> little<00:04:52.300> misleading<00:04:52.570> on

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
thought that was a little misleading on

thought that was a little misleading on
