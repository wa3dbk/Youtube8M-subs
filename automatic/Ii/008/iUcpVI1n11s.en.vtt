00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello today we are going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.680
 windmill with felt for 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.630
 it in addition to the felt of the colors 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.400
 What we like most will need some 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.400
 needle and thread scissors 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 we'll start by cutting out two squares 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.320
 same of two different colors 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.200
 the measurement of this square will depend on 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.020
 how big do you want your 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.790
 grinder and colors of course 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.790
 They may be the ones you like the most 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.870
 then with the help of our 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.620
 scissors we will cut several diagonals without 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.620
 get to the center 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.090
 the next step will be to catch 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.930
 one of the corners and bring them to the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.930
 square center 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.319
 with the help of the needle and the thread 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.880
 we will know a little to avoid 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 let us go 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.500
 we will have to repeat the same process 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.010
 with the four parts that we have cut 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.010
 before 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.830
 and here you have the final result if 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 you can do it a little more 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.970
 small and use it as a brooch or to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 decorate your diademas your something 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 more for hair for anything that 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.420
