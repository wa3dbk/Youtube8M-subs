00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.160 
incorporated them into her design so
it's<00:00:37.370> really<00:00:37.640> very<00:00:38.120> pretty<00:00:38.719> and<00:00:38.809> as<00:00:39.019> a

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's really very pretty and as a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.110 
it's really very pretty and as a
cohesive<00:00:39.559> look<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.129> just<00:00:40.340> adds<00:00:40.579> that<00:00:40.879> extra

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
cohesive look it just adds that extra

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.139 
cohesive look it just adds that extra
punched<00:00:41.899> that<00:00:42.320> extra<00:00:42.739> added<00:00:43.160> design<00:00:43.579> element

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
punched that extra added design element

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.660 
punched that extra added design element
so<00:00:44.989> this<00:00:45.199> is<00:00:45.379> what<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.710> ultra<00:00:46.070> suede<00:00:46.280> looks

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
so this is what the ultra suede looks

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.029 
so this is what the ultra suede looks
like<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.120> she<00:00:47.329> very<00:00:47.750> easily<00:00:48.050> cut<00:00:48.590> out<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.829> piece

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
like and she very easily cut out a piece

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.040 
like and she very easily cut out a piece
of<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:49.730> going<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:49.940> show<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:50.149> how<00:00:50.269> easy<00:00:50.539> it

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
of it I'm going to show you how easy it

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.470 
of it I'm going to show you how easy it
is<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.260> actually<00:00:51.859> cut<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:55.579> very<00:00:55.820> easy<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.269> cut

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
is to actually cut so very easy to cut

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.660 
is to actually cut so very easy to cut
and<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.870> does<00:00:57.079> not<00:00:57.230> fray<00:00:57.589> it's<00:00:58.129> also<00:00:58.339> something

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
and it does not fray it's also something

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.340 
and it does not fray it's also something
that<00:00:58.789> you<00:00:58.969> can<00:00:59.089> easily<00:00:59.300> wash<00:00:59.749> if<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.170> gets

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
that you can easily wash if it gets

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.349 
that you can easily wash if it gets
dirty<00:01:00.589> so<00:01:00.920> that's<00:01:01.129> another<00:01:01.429> benefit<00:01:02.059> if<00:01:02.239> you

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359
