command blocks has come out basically we

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.420 
command blocks has come out basically we
have<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.880> slash<00:00:21.480> film<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.619> slash<00:00:23.010> clone

command and these commands are what make
up<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.840> special<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.830> building<00:00:29.929> area

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
up this special little building area

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.440 
up this special little building area
that<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> made<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.090> platform

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that I made so we have this platform

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.560 
that I made so we have this platform
here<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.520> build<00:00:35.730> anything<00:00:36.059> that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
here in which we can build anything that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.280 
here in which we can build anything that
we<00:00:36.719> want<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:38.730> will<00:00:38.760> save<00:00:39.390> our<00:00:39.570> builds<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
we want and we will save our builds and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
we want and we will save our builds and
we<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.860> even<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> slide<00:00:41.820> show<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.210> our

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we can even have a slide show of our

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.069 
we can even have a slide show of our
builds<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:44.340> pretty<00:00:44.640> simple<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.210> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
builds and it's pretty simple you can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.709 
builds and it's pretty simple you can
see<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.530> along<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> side<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.670> are<00:00:48.120> some

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
see all along the side here are some

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.340 
see all along the side here are some
previously<00:00:49.379> built<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> saved<00:00:50.820> images<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
previously built and saved images that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
previously built and saved images that
third<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.340> end<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
third one at the end is the one that we

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.020 
third one at the end is the one that we
see<00:00:54.629> here<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> blank<00:00:55.680> slate<00:00:56.070> now

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
see here which is the blank slate now

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
see here which is the blank slate now
you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.270> build<00:00:57.510> anything<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> want

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you can build anything that you want

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
you can build anything that you want
within<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.160> slight<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.789> long<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> does

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
within this slight as long as it does

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280 
within this slight as long as it does
not<00:01:01.230> reach<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.949> glass<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:04.019> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
not reach the glass up here it can be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.170 
not reach the glass up here it can be
right<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> cannot<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
right here but it cannot be up here and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.910 
right here but it cannot be up here and
you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.510> any<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.200> builds<00:01:10.500> within

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you can have any of you builds within

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
you can have any of you builds within
here<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.760> nothing<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:13.560> right

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
here but nothing out here all right

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.760 
here but nothing out here all right
that's<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> works<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:16.049> simple<00:01:16.530> but

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's just how it works very simple but

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
that's just how it works very simple but
works<00:01:17.220> perfectly<00:01:17.700> okay<00:01:18.799> now<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.369> have

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.990 
works perfectly okay now we also have
these<00:01:21.210> presets<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.500> side<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.670> instance

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
these presets on the side for instance

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.619 

back<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.060> little<00:03:40.330> house<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.620> door<00:03:41.950> is

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
back to the little house the door is

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.009 
back to the little house the door is
open<00:03:43.629> very<00:03:43.959> cool<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.470> door<00:03:44.650> stays<00:03:44.950> open<00:03:45.129> and

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
so it kind of filters in a cycle once

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.009 
so it kind of filters in a cycle once
you<00:03:54.910> reach<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.269> end<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.569> starts<00:03:55.840> from<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
you reach the end it starts from the

you reach the end it starts from the
beginning<00:03:56.200> again<00:03:56.819> alright<00:03:57.819> so<00:03:58.410> we<00:03:59.410> can<00:03:59.560> also

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
beginning again alright so we can also

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.050 
beginning again alright so we can also
do<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.519> start<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.599> stop<00:04:02.140> slideshow<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.819> as<00:04:03.940> you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
do a start and stop slideshow so as you

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.490 
do a start and stop slideshow so as you
can<00:04:04.209> see<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:04.599> just<00:04:04.840> going<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.080> filter

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
can see it's just going to filter

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.759

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
clear platform will not delete saved

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.540 
clear platform will not delete saved
work<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:35.900> basically<00:04:36.410> we<00:04:37.010> clear<00:04:37.310> that

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
work so basically we clear that

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.760 
work so basically we clear that
everything's<00:04:38.510> gone<00:04:38.810> but<00:04:39.110> don't<00:04:39.320> worry<00:04:39.530> if

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
everything's gone but don't worry if

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.410 
everything's gone but don't worry if
that<00:04:39.980> was<00:04:40.100> an<00:04:40.220> accident<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.760> can<00:04:40.910> just<00:04:41.120> put

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
that was an accident you can just put

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.950 
that was an accident you can just put
forward<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.580> then<00:04:43.580> go<00:04:43.790> back<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.540> there<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:44.870> is

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
forward and then go back and there it is

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.550 
forward and then go back and there it is
again<00:04:45.110> perfect<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.330> what<00:04:47.660> we<00:04:48.020> can<00:04:48.200> do<00:04:48.380> is<00:04:48.530> just

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
again perfect so what we can do is just

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.120 
again perfect so what we can do is just
clear<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:49.340> add<00:04:49.630> something<00:04:50.630> let's<00:04:51.440> say<00:04:51.770> you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
clear that add something let's say you

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.830 
clear that add something let's say you
want<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.460> build<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.790> castle<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.480> come<00:04:53.720> over

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
want to build a castle you come over

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.050

here<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.170> do<00:04:54.530> your<00:04:54.740> build<00:04:54.980> and<00:04:55.280> then<00:04:55.910> you

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.180 
decide if you like it or not you can
save<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.640> if<00:04:58.940> not<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.480> just<00:04:59.750> move<00:05:00.530> on<00:05:00.830> and
