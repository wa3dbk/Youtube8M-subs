00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 custody made as soon as you have done the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.519
 your laps 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.360
 you too will find yourself so well 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:15.929
 with your ipad to your tablet 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 here we are now going to do the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.640
 closures 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:30.689
 we set our work so we join 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:37.219
 well the two parts and two halves and let's start 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:40.800
 our closure so we take half 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:44.250
 of the chain stitch all low that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.750
 we did up there so half the half 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.460
 inside the inner half of the other 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 we take together take a ribbon and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.300
 let's move forward in everything 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.659
 so 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.659
 12 you take the ribbon you do so 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.390
 and went on like this until closing the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 your base 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 tighten well 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.689
 I always recommend the most internal points 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:53.509
 now let's do one last there 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.509
 forget here 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.509
 very well 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.810
 get well here we have ours 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.260
 closing down 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.260
 here it is 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.629
 take the scissors 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.150
 cut a sliver left is something 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:36.459
 enough to stop the wire 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 within the work as well 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.090
 take the up and pull 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.760
 I do n't leave this here then 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:55.270
 this way I step from the inside reason 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:59.250
 I was firm that now we are cute 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.250
 the upper closure 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.850
 yet 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.080
 We flatten our job well 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 take the half we take the part 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.490
 back of work where we have the line yes 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.400
 see this rich where we have where we are 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.380
 anyway saliva shows a 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:37.970
 little bit here because the thread is very much 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.970
 colored then to start with finally 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:49.070
 we go to work half so I do 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.320
 let me see well half work 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.110
 we put on the crochet hook 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.000
 take the ribbon and pull it there 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:04.050
 let's make a chain 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.739
 keep some of it because with it 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:15.720
 I'll stop work now if you do 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:19.500
 remember I had 17 points plus 17 points 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.470
 so you calculate half 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:31.850
 I work your goal neither I will work 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.850
 17 then low obviously 1 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.460
 2 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.180
 Well 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.710
 4 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.499
 5 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.139
 5pm 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:23.889
 of these 17 we make a chain and 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.509
 we turn the job ourselves in this way 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.759
 going to go up 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:34.500
 we will make a strip to close the 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.500
 our custody 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.560
 let's make our 17 low points then 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:49.110
 each of you can do a little as you want 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.110
 make another kind of disaster closure 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.310
 with a bit of imagination 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.740
 they are so cute 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:14.430
 here we are now almost finished 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.410
 we also closed the upper part 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.710
 so you can do it even longer 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.880
 in short, he sees a bit like going down 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:32.680
 you want I gave a cue 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:35.800
 here is now how to close it 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.110
 put a magnet come the magnets 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.270
 he goes here and here is closed 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.120
 calamity or you do 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.360
 chain stitch next to a hook 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.860
 here is a button and so you can do the 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:56.210
 your closing i dont know i hope to be 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.870
 these threads were obviously clear 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:03.170
 cut them stuck behind always in the 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.620
 side of the wrong side lille strung in 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:10.280
 points to hide it is this one 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:14.330
 instead , pull it down inside 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:17.720
 and so your ipad case holder 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:20.720
 is finished I find it very nice 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.900
 you can also make the shoulder strap as mentioned 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.920
 first in the house will make a video to give you from 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.880
 a bit of advice on how to do it then 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.850
 have fun 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.790
 to one thing I did not remind you that ad 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:38.600
 obviously every chain is made of a chain 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:43.160
 and then you go around then chain yes 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.620
 the other is always always counted i 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.290
 your points your points for not 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.290
 then have trapezoid shapes in short 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.350
 some unwanted decrease 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:57.310
 so have fun soon 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:02.440
