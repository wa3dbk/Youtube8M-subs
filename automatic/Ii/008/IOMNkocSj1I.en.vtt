00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello everyone, we will continue 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.519
 make a menu for our games and today we 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.860
 We will remove the settings for our game Well 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.750
 let's start the first thing we do, we 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.639
 copy this level 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.789
 right click and click 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.430
 clone level here we appear 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.060
 new level not level we look like 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 just like the first one to do 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 settings for our game we need 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:35.510
 delete these three buttons and let's 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's fill in new buttons now 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 we will fill them through the sprite here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 opened our buttons for setting and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.129
 now cut our logo here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 buttons 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:57.719
 the first thing we do and we cut 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:02.840
 button sound cut so we do not have 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.840
 somewhere in the middle level 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.010
 deal because here again we open this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.610
 to 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.610
 sencor 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 and cut out other buttons for example 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.210
 turn off and on 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.009
 I think how to cut these buttons you 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.520
 you know, that is, I already showed how it is 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:32.860
 do i think you yourself can handle well 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.590
 Now I added our buttons now let's 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.729
 we will do it so that you have them less 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.729
 looked beautiful 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.490
 for this we have our buttons auger 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.689
 me exactly the way we are here so here 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.689
 our buttons are located 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.459
 turn on our buttons turn off 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.459
 full screen for coma mode 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.540
 so here are the buttons we add now 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.050
 let's move events register 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.940
 events for our second level 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.580
 but before adding events for 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.850
 of our new level we will add a new 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:19.660
 global change and our liza 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:23.070
 global variable sound idle 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.660
 we will return the event and prescribe our all 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:32.130
 buttons go 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:40.120
 We go such an event if we clicked on 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:49.650
 enable if we clicked enable if 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:55.209
 we clicked on the object to enable 9 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.230
 turn off then global variable sound 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:05.150
 we are getting 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:08.319
 0 and if we clicked on we 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.319
 the sound becomes 1 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.239
 so while we have nothing 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 work because we don't have any 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.580
 sounds of the game itself but we do it a little 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.330
 later we will add sounds from the first ti 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.010
 do full screen and windowed mode for 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.599
 this we will create such an event if we 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:35.930
 clicked on the full screen that is 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:41.910
 Spiral 10 pro 10 long with us 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:46.709
 Full screen starts full screen 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.380
 that's what we need and if we clicked on 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.390
 window mode tula starts window 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.569
 mode that is, our window will be small 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.280
 1 separatists our settings but him 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.080
 immediately warn me will not 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.830
 work full screen because 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.239
 write down through 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.390
 Kamtazia and Kamtazia for some reason do not want 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.750
 write video if we record in full 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.810
 screen 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:15.200
 Well try to wait if protestit 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.570
 click full screen 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.750
 not everything works for me so everything is for us 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.550
 works and now let's make a sound 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.260
 Well, I also noticed that I am a little bit 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.610
 stone prescribed I wrote this button but 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:35.310
 need full screen here when we have 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.590
 everything will work right now 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.990
 let's do it so that we can 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.479
 music off and on for 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.880
 we will need to add another 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.030
 sound but the sound i have already added for this we 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.360
 right click on the files and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.110
 add new sound look for our sound and our 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:00.030
 the sound must be a wave formation that is 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.940
 such a format so I have already added and 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.650
 here I already have our sound now let's 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.830
 will do so that we could include and 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.700
 turn off our music for this we 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.600
 create such an event 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.760
 First we define our global 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:23.750
 variable sound if the sound is 0 and 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:26.250
 the sound is 1 and let's get started we 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.340
 let's start our sound so that our sound always 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:34.770
 would have played before we will create such 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:37.289
 event put the levels here 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.570
 music starts and by the way we need 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.630
 add 2 x audio 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:47.639
 such an object here it is located 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:54.650
 add it go such an event 3 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:06:02.970
 start level x audio 2 downloads us 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:05.840
 resource music loads he resource music 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.099
 and we should have channel 1 and 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.970
 fixated because i have this background 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:15.349
 music and now let's do that 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:19.250
 could turn our sound on and off 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.250
 if the sound is 0 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.919
 tom our channel stops then 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:31.099
 we have all the music stops 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:35.580
 if the sound is one 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:37.440
 then their soldier background if we have sound one then 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.810
 we should be running music that is 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.789
 play and here we have 2 0 then we 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.219
 it stops if the sound is one 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:54.000
 music starts well what to expect a pirate with 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:59.370
 we run it click to turn on the music 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.890
 works to make you better, I could hear 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.479
 I put here and so it is heard 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:08.599
 that the music is going to press off 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:13.440
 music turned off click on 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:17.250
 music works well here are the settings for 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.550
 of our game we made we can 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.340
 it is desirable to add such 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.159
 buttons in the game itself and here under 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.510
 small corner but i think on this i 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.520
 the lesson has already finished 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.640
 but in the next part we will continue to do 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.710
 menu and we do it a few small 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.969
 such flaws that still remain 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.159
 thank you all for watching subscribe 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:43.159
 put likes and all for now
