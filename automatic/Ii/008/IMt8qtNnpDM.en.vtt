00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.350
 let's try all day we start the 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.929
 10 am to finish this evening at 7 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.829
 hard work but we like it is a nice one 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.179
 responsibility 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:58.180
 but I hope to give my part to 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.609
 baby in the best way the scene with 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 I really like pop art when 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.010
 she goes to the Pope who does not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.479
 practically no scene is spoken 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.030
 that strikes me so much my weight 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.650
 then ok, all I adore I suspect is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.369
 this is the problem I like 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.369
 from beginning to end 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.220
 it means that with dhabi we have found 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.600
 a great feeling also between us and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.970
 so we can work with the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.649
 total tranquility we are very into 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.979
 tuning so this allows us to 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.110
 being able to do scenes that are still intense and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.289
 also sentimentally with the maximum 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.289
 tranquility 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.970
 what is its link with italy and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.490
 because she speaks Italian and I'm happy 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:01.680
 in Italy it is the creed is the country of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.259
 happiness and beauty I know how much I can 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.500
 return to Italy and I'm so happy 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.760
 and in Italy and then I think about who is in the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.090
 roads and second pole inside me I can 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.650
 region aa my home in new york 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.630
 what do you like most about the theater I see who 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.580
 lecture was given at the theater and I am 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.070
 ignore and didn't think so now 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.540
 now when i look at this is it 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:37.920
 public to this is the thing he has 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:43.280
 always wanted to be here in presence 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:50.959
 of these stories I have not forded this 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.959
 point where it cannot be done 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.610
 when the hearing was released I have 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.770
 since there were some features 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.349
 techniques to have a certain type of 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.510
 athletic physique rather than muscular 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.360
 a good a great predisposition 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.330
 to dance and also to acting has 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.209
 said ok I can stay but let's review the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.280
 movie let's see if it can really fit i 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.810
 cloths of what patrick swayze is 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.930
 not at all a past interpretation 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.110
 to the stars has made everyone and fall in love 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.400
 then I realized you are I can 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.830
 tell this story 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.250
 this love affair involves 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.340
 yet all of us do not still excites 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.019
 us when we are in the rehearsal room and arrive 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.390
 the magic moment of time of my life 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.880
 rather than Andrea and we are all there 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.980
 so also myself that the intervention by 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.819
 what is very beautiful but we are very happy 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.650
 at the moment there is a beautiful energy on 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.590
 really hard work demands for 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.519
 all because as already mentioned in others 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.700
 bargains is paired dance for 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.859
 which there is a great demand 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.859
 listening to the partner and vice versa for 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.450

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.019
