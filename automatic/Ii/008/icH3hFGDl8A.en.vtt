sitting on the subject of your scene but
there<00:00:33.960> will<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.140> times<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.739> you'll<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
there will be times when you'll need to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
there will be times when you'll need to
override<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.149> automatic<00:00:36.809> mechanism

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
override that automatic mechanism

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.690 
override that automatic mechanism
because<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.680> will<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.950> chosen<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> wrong

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
because it will have chosen the wrong

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
because it will have chosen the wrong
point<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.719> you'll<00:00:39.930> need<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.200> manually

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
point and so you'll need to manually

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.100 
point and so you'll need to manually
choose<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> focus<00:00:41.610> point<00:00:41.760> yourself<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.719> force

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
choose a focus point yourself to force

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.900 
choose a focus point yourself to force
the<00:00:43.350> camera<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.860> focus<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> particular

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the camera to focus to a particular

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.060

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
shown inside my viewfinder right now
obviously<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.270> can't<00:01:45.450> show<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.869> from

obviously we can't show you that from

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
obviously we can't show you that from
here<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.500> you'll<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> exact<00:01:47.220> same<00:01:47.310> thing

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
here but you'll see the exact same thing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
here but you'll see the exact same thing
in<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.750> viewfinder<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> actually

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
in your viewfinder so you can actually

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.100 
in your viewfinder so you can actually
change<00:01:50.040> focus<00:01:50.369> points<00:01:50.850> without<00:01:51.149> having<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
change focus points without having to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
change focus points without having to
take<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.290> eye<00:01:52.470> from<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> viewfinder<00:01:53.040> once

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
take your eye from the viewfinder once

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.219 
take your eye from the viewfinder once
that's<00:01:54.210> selected<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> number<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that's selected I have a number of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.719 
that's selected I have a number of
different<00:01:55.770> ways<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.040> changing<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> point

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
different ways of changing the point

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
different ways of changing the point
probably<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.630> you'll<00:01:57.780> use<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.079> most<00:01:58.110> is

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
probably the one you'll use the most is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.499 
probably the one you'll use the most is
to<00:01:58.680> turn<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> main<00:01:59.549> dial<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.210> say<00:02:00.360> you'll

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to turn the main dial and I say you'll

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
to turn the main dial and I say you'll
use<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> most<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.280> main<00:02:02.460> dial

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
use this the most because the main dial

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
use this the most because the main dial
is<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:03.000> behind<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> shutter<00:02:03.570> button<00:02:03.630> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
is right behind the shutter button so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.660 
is right behind the shutter button so
you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.259> easily<00:02:04.469> move<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:04.829> finger<00:02:05.250> back<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you can easily move your finger back to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.459 
you can easily move your finger back to
it<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:06.869> cycling

which is all points selected when it's
showing<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.400> means<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.760> camera<00:02:20.270> will

use<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.510> rear<00:02:26.690> dial<00:02:26.960> if<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.380> prefer<00:02:27.680> using

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
use the rear dial if you prefer using

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.960 
use the rear dial if you prefer using
your<00:02:28.100> thumb<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:28.790> want<00:02:28.910> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
your thumb because you don't want to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.920

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that's fine or of course I can use the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.410 
that's fine or of course I can use the
quick<00:02:32.810> control<00:02:33.500> screen<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.730> saw<00:02:34.970> earlier

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
quick control screen that we saw earlier

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.130 
quick control screen that we saw earlier
I<00:02:35.660> prefer<00:02:36.290> doing<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.890> back<00:02:37.610> here<00:02:38.150> rather<00:02:38.960> than

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
I prefer doing it back here rather than

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.360 
I prefer doing it back here rather than
the<00:02:39.200> quick<00:02:39.350> control<00:02:39.620> screen<00:02:39.830> again<00:02:40.070> because<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
the quick control screen again because I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.710 
the quick control screen again because I
don't<00:02:40.550> have<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.970> take<00:02:41.120> my<00:02:41.240> eye<00:02:41.270> from<00:02:41.570> the

don't have to take my eye from the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.360 
don't have to take my eye from the
