station<00:00:50.000> was<00:00:50.480> moved<00:00:50.720> in<00:00:50.930> 1920<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.159> moved

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
station was moved in 1920 and I moved

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.640 
station was moved in 1920 and I moved
again<00:00:52.699> in<00:00:52.930> 1951<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.110> make<00:00:54.260> way<00:00:54.409> for<00:00:54.470> a

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
again in 1951 to make way for a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.399 
again in 1951 to make way for a
conservatory<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:56.330> weather<00:00:56.510> stations<00:00:56.960> been

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
conservatory the weather stations been

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.530 
conservatory the weather stations been
in<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.710> location<00:00:58.309> where<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.610> now<00:00:58.879> ever

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
in the location where it is now ever

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.610 
in the location where it is now ever
since<00:00:59.750> then<00:01:00.280> let<00:01:01.280> me<00:01:01.370> show<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.580> around

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
since then let me show you around

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.860 
since then let me show you around
so<00:01:03.620> this<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:04.070> our<00:01:04.460> manual<00:01:04.909> rain<00:01:05.180> gauge<00:01:05.510> and

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
so this is our manual rain gauge and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.690 
so this is our manual rain gauge and
we've<00:01:06.049> had<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.320> rain<00:01:06.590> gauge<00:01:06.799> on<00:01:07.159> site<00:01:07.490> pretty

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
we've had a rain gauge on site pretty

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.230 
we've had a rain gauge on site pretty
much<00:01:07.790> like<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.270> one<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.780> last<00:01:09.020> 130<00:01:09.500> years

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
much like this one the last 130 years

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.560 
much like this one the last 130 years
every<00:01:11.240> morning<00:01:11.600> we<00:01:11.720> have<00:01:11.870> to<00:01:12.020> come<00:01:13.390> take<00:01:14.390> off

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
every morning we have to come take off

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.310 
every morning we have to come take off
the<00:01:14.720> funnel

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.140 

take<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.040> bottle<00:01:18.340> out<00:01:18.460> from<00:01:18.700> inside<00:01:18.820> which

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
take the bottle out from inside which

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.149 
take the bottle out from inside which
has<00:01:19.300> been<00:01:19.450> gathering<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.930> rainwater<00:01:20.350> and

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
has been gathering the rainwater and

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.860 
has been gathering the rainwater and
then<00:01:21.400> pour<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.820> into<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.300> measuring<00:01:22.540> cylinder

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
then pour it into a measuring cylinder

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.440 
then pour it into a measuring cylinder
just<00:01:23.229> like<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:23.500> one

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.330 

and<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.600> tells<00:01:28.840> us<00:01:29.050> exactly<00:01:29.410> how<00:01:29.890> much<00:01:30.070> rain

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
and that tells us exactly how much rain

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.260 
and that tells us exactly how much rain
we've<00:01:30.700> been<00:01:30.730> having<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.570> last<00:01:31.720> 24<00:01:32.200> hours

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we've been having in the last 24 hours

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.850 
we've been having in the last 24 hours
so<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> tipping<00:01:35.170> bucket<00:01:35.320> rain<00:01:35.620> gauge

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
so this is a tipping bucket rain gauge

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.770 
so this is a tipping bucket rain gauge
which<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.340> automated<00:01:36.790> version<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
which is the automated version of the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.470 
which is the automated version of the
rain<00:01:37.930> gauge<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.350> was<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.680> talking<00:01:39.070> about

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
rain gauge that I was just talking about

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.460 
rain gauge that I was just talking about
and<00:01:40.480> it<00:01:40.600> works<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:40.960> much<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.140> same<00:01:41.260> way

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and it works in much the same way

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.000 
and it works in much the same way
funneling<00:01:42.400> water<00:01:42.670> through<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.630> part<00:01:44.010> onto

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
funneling water through this part onto

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.219 
funneling water through this part onto
one<00:01:45.520> side<00:01:45.820> or<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.150> other<00:01:46.180> of<00:01:46.570> these<00:01:46.810> buckets

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
one side or the other of these buckets

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.860 
one side or the other of these buckets
and<00:01:47.740> when<00:01:48.670> an<00:01:48.790> appropriate<00:01:49.270> amount<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.630> water

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
and when an appropriate amount of water

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.840 
and when an appropriate amount of water
has<00:01:50.110> fallen<00:01:50.410> onto<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.160> side<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.580> Bukit

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
has fallen onto this side of the Bukit

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.810 
has fallen onto this side of the Bukit
it<00:01:52.330> tipped<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.160> starts<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.520> fall<00:01:54.670> on

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
it tipped and then it starts to fall on

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.030 
it tipped and then it starts to fall on
the<00:01:54.940> other<00:01:55.060> side<00:01:55.300> of<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.570> bucket<00:01:55.900> and<00:01:56.080> same

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
the other side of the bucket and same

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.219 
the other side of the bucket and same
again<00:01:57.400> when<00:01:58.060> an<00:01:58.180> appropriate<00:01:58.720> amount<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:59.020> rain

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
again when an appropriate amount of rain

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.040 
again when an appropriate amount of rain
is<00:01:59.380> fallen<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.250> will<00:02:00.400> tip<00:02:00.550> again<00:02:00.790> each<00:02:01.690> time

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
is fallen it will tip again each time

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.440 
is fallen it will tip again each time
the<00:02:02.170> bucket<00:02:02.470> tips<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.250> computer<00:02:03.729> knows<00:02:03.910> that

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the bucket tips the computer knows that

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.120 
the bucket tips the computer knows that
naught<00:02:04.720> point<00:02:04.960> two<00:02:05.200> millimeters<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.920> rainfall

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
naught point two millimeters of rainfall

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.729 
naught point two millimeters of rainfall
has<00:02:06.820> been<00:02:07.030> recorded<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:08.320> that's<00:02:08.500> how<00:02:08.679> the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
has been recorded and that's how the
