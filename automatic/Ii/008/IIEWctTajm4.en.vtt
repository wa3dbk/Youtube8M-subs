it<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> most<00:01:57.689> beautiful<00:01:58.170> ones

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it is one of the most beautiful ones

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.460 
it is one of the most beautiful ones
that<00:01:58.469> I've<00:01:58.619> seen<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> case

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
that I've seen on a case

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.580 
that I've seen on a case
doesn't<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.370> here's<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:03.260> it

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
doesn't it here's a with it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.580 
doesn't it here's a with it
gypsies<00:02:04.130> Briscoe<00:02:04.630> however<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.260> distance

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
gypsies Briscoe however the distance

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.300 
gypsies Briscoe however the distance
from<00:02:06.830> there<00:02:07.479> around<00:02:08.479> here<00:02:08.950> it's<00:02:09.950> not<00:02:10.040> long

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
from there around here it's not long

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.120 
from there around here it's not long
enough<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.850> case<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:12.080> quite<00:02:12.380> thin<00:02:12.680> so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
enough and the case is quite thin so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.310 
enough and the case is quite thin so
what<00:02:13.280> happens<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:14.090> these<00:02:14.300> tubes<00:02:14.660> get<00:02:14.870> kinked

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
what happens is these tubes get kinked

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.320 
what happens is these tubes get kinked
much<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.860> same<00:02:16.010> as<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> hose<00:02:16.430> pipe<00:02:16.460> would<00:02:17.000> if

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
much the same as a hose pipe would if

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.090 
much the same as a hose pipe would if
you<00:02:17.540> hold<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.080> garden<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.800> folded

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
you hold it in the garden and it folded

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.190 
you hold it in the garden and it folded
over<00:02:19.220> upon<00:02:19.580> itself<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.600> liquid<00:02:20.780> can't

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
over upon itself so the liquid can't

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.530 
over upon itself so the liquid can't
travel<00:02:21.440> through<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> had<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.940> run<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.210> tubes

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
travel through so I had to run the tubes

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.450 
travel through so I had to run the tubes
not<00:02:23.930> whether<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.860> supposed<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.190> go<00:02:25.310> through

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
not whether I supposed to go through

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.580 
not whether I supposed to go through
here<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:25.850> where<00:02:26.210> this<00:02:26.420> sort<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.900> 18

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590

supposed to be housed that way it gives

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.990 
supposed to be housed that way it gives
the<00:02:33.080> tubes<00:02:33.350> enough<00:02:33.680> length<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.760> they're

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the tubes enough length so that they're

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.030 
the tubes enough length so that they're
not<00:02:35.150> king<00:02:35.540> when<00:02:35.990> you<00:02:36.050> put<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.290> glass<00:02:36.500> panel<00:02:36.950> on

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
not king when you put the glass panel on

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.330 
not king when you put the glass panel on
the<00:02:37.130> side<00:02:37.660> additionally<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:39.020> cooler<00:02:39.530> unit

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the side additionally that cooler unit

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.400 
the side additionally that cooler unit
for<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.520> CPU<00:02:40.850> will<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.390> fit<00:02:41.660> through<00:02:42.050> that

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
for the CPU will not fit through that

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.800 
for the CPU will not fit through that
gap<00:02:43.190> which<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.180> where<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.660> supposed<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:45.020> go

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
gap which is where it's supposed to go

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.210 
gap which is where it's supposed to go
so<00:02:47.810> unfortunately<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.470> did<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.830> dismantle

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
so unfortunately I did have to dismantle

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.160 
so unfortunately I did have to dismantle
mine<00:02:49.640> before<00:02:50.000> installing<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.660> which<00:02:50.870> is

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
mine before installing it which is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.780 
mine before installing it which is
something<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.770> shouldn't<00:02:52.010> really<00:02:52.310> need<00:02:52.640> to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
something you shouldn't really need to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.720 
something you shouldn't really need to
do<00:02:53.380> if<00:02:54.380> you're<00:02:54.590> not<00:02:54.620> happy<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.100> do<00:02:55.250> that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
do if you're not happy to do that

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.790 
do if you're not happy to do that
then<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.660> may<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.080> reconsider<00:02:57.230> by<00:02:57.740> in

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
then you may want to reconsider by in

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.980 
then you may want to reconsider by in
this<00:02:57.980> case<00:02:58.190> with<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.490> type<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.790> cooler<00:02:59.060> more

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
this case with this type of cooler more

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.699 
this case with this type of cooler more
things<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.470> consider<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:03.100> back<00:03:04.100> here

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
things to consider is back here

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.130 
things to consider is back here
the<00:03:06.709> cables<00:03:07.160> all<00:03:07.400> fit<00:03:07.700> between<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.720> panel

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the cables all fit between this panel

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.100 
the cables all fit between this panel
and<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:10.040> panel<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.970> glass<00:03:11.180> panel<00:03:11.840> goes<00:03:11.989> on

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
and that panel the glass panel goes on

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.990 
and that panel the glass panel goes on
the<00:03:12.170> side<00:03:12.350> covers<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.769> all<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.220> think<00:03:13.910> it's

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the side covers it all I think it's

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.460 
the side covers it all I think it's
having<00:03:14.150> got<00:03:14.360> too<00:03:14.510> expensive<00:03:14.720> monitors<00:03:15.320> so

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
having got too expensive monitors so

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.800 
having got too expensive monitors so
mine's<00:03:15.650> got<00:03:15.800> an<00:03:15.920> adapter<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.430> plugs<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:17.030> see

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
mine's got an adapter that plugs in see

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.430 
mine's got an adapter that plugs in see
my<00:03:17.959> cables<00:03:18.440> there<00:03:19.150> now<00:03:20.290> unfortunately<00:03:21.290> if<00:03:21.350> you

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
my cables there now unfortunately if you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.199 
my cables there now unfortunately if you
use<00:03:21.590> an<00:03:21.709> adapter<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.340> gap<00:03:22.580> isn't<00:03:23.060> wide

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
use an adapter that gap isn't wide

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.979 
use an adapter that gap isn't wide
enough<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.980> doesn't<00:03:25.280> work<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.570> had<00:03:26.870> to

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
enough and it doesn't work so I had to

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.130 
enough and it doesn't work so I had to
come<00:03:27.140> up<00:03:27.170> with<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.830> solution<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.870> use

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
come up with a solution so I use

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.930 
come up with a solution so I use
motherboard<00:03:30.680> boats<00:03:30.980> here<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.519> can<00:03:31.610> see<00:03:31.730> that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
motherboard boats here you can see that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.900 
motherboard boats here you can see that
that's<00:03:32.480> supposed<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.900> sit<00:03:33.110> flush<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.730> that

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
that's supposed to sit flush but that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.289 
that's supposed to sit flush but that
gap<00:03:35.570> there<00:03:35.900> bear<00:03:36.680> without<00:03:36.830> torch<00:03:37.310> gives<00:03:38.090> me<00:03:38.209> an

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
gap there bear without torch gives me an

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.259 
gap there bear without torch gives me an
extra<00:03:38.540> 5<00:03:38.750> millimeters<00:03:39.850> which<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:41.000> enough

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
extra 5 millimeters which is enough

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.850 
extra 5 millimeters which is enough
space<00:03:41.450> then<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.880> fit<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.900> adapter<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
space then to fit the adapter and the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.550 
space then to fit the adapter and the
video<00:03:46.070> cable<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.900> with<00:03:47.900> these<00:03:48.019> that's<00:03:48.440> a

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
video cable in with these that's a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.289 
video cable in with these that's a
really<00:03:48.890> easy<00:03:49.070> solution<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.820> it<00:03:49.940> will<00:03:50.090> work

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
really easy solution and it will work

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.080 
really easy solution and it will work
for<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.630> for<00:03:51.220> boats<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.580> goes<00:03:52.760> on<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.940> side

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
for you for boats that goes on the side

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.580 
for you for boats that goes on the side
once<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.600> glass<00:03:53.780> panels<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.290> side<00:03:54.470> it

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
once it glass panels on the side it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.590 
once it glass panels on the side it
covers<00:03:54.860> all<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:55.220> anyway<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.330> you<00:03:56.390> can't

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
covers all of this anyway so you can't

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.300 
covers all of this anyway so you can't
see<00:03:56.780> any<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.200> another<00:03:57.890> thing<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.130> consider

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
see any of it another thing to consider

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.940 
see any of it another thing to consider
is<00:03:58.760> there's<00:03:59.600> not<00:03:59.840> that<00:04:00.080> much<00:04:00.320> cooling<00:04:00.799> in<00:04:00.920> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
is there's not that much cooling in the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.620 
is there's not that much cooling in the
case<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.459> doesn't<00:04:01.670> come<00:04:01.880> with<00:04:02.000> any<00:04:02.030> fans<00:04:02.360> when

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
case it doesn't come with any fans when

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.510 
case it doesn't come with any fans when
you<00:04:02.720> buy<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.970> have<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.180> buy<00:04:05.299> your<00:04:05.330> own

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
you buy it so you have to buy your own

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.970 
you buy it so you have to buy your own
me<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.910> fan<00:04:07.150> here<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.420> got<00:04:07.720> although<00:04:08.440> my<00:04:08.620> graphics

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
me a fan here I got although my graphics

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.590 
me a fan here I got although my graphics
card<00:04:09.010> was<00:04:09.340> running<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.060> only<00:04:10.270> runs<00:04:10.450> at<00:04:10.540> about

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
card was running the only runs at about

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.950 
card was running the only runs at about
70<00:04:11.140> degrees<00:04:11.230> an<00:04:11.620> MSI<00:04:12.750> 970

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
70 degrees an MSI 970

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.590 
70 degrees an MSI 970
it<00:04:14.410> was<00:04:14.560> running<00:04:14.830> a<00:04:15.250> tank<00:04:15.790> degrees<00:04:16.090> hotter<00:04:16.330> in

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
it was running a tank degrees hotter in

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.570 
it was running a tank degrees hotter in
this<00:04:16.810> case<00:04:17.050> so<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.770> had<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.160> come<00:04:18.280> up<00:04:18.370> with<00:04:18.430> a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
this case so I had to come up with a

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.920 
this case so I had to come up with a
solution<00:04:19.060> myself<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:21.750> removed<00:04:22.750> some<00:04:22.840> of

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
solution myself so I removed some of

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.740 
solution myself so I removed some of
these<00:04:23.050> panels<00:04:23.470> down<00:04:23.650> here<00:04:23.980> you<00:04:24.160> can<00:04:24.280> see<00:04:24.750> see

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
these panels down here you can see see

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.870 
these panels down here you can see see
them<00:04:25.960> taking<00:04:26.320> them<00:04:26.500> out<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.340> put<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.580> fan<00:04:27.850> in

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
them taking them out and I put a fan in

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.620 
them taking them out and I put a fan in
there<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.200> now<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.190> keeps<00:04:30.580> my<00:04:30.760> card<00:04:31.090> as<00:04:31.360> cool

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
there and now that keeps my card as cool

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.510 
there and now that keeps my card as cool
as<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.930> did<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.290> my<00:04:32.350> old<00:04:32.770> case<00:04:33.040> which<00:04:33.280> had<00:04:33.490> a

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
as it did in my old case which had a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.660 
as it did in my old case which had a
huge<00:04:33.910> sort<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.770> 200<00:04:35.770> millimeter<00:04:36.220> fan<00:04:36.460> on<00:04:36.640> the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
huge sort of 200 millimeter fan on the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.610 
huge sort of 200 millimeter fan on the
side<00:04:36.940> blown<00:04:37.270> there<00:04:37.540> straight<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.110> onto<00:04:38.530> the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
side blown there straight in onto the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.610 
side blown there straight in onto the
motherboard<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:40.690> graphics<00:04:41.080> card<00:04:41.350> that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
motherboard and the graphics card that

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.800 
motherboard and the graphics card that
keeps<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.370> case<00:04:42.610> as<00:04:42.850> cool<00:04:43.150> when<00:04:43.330> though<00:04:43.450> so

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
keeps this case as cool when though so

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.600 
keeps this case as cool when though so
I'm<00:04:43.870> happy<00:04:44.170> with<00:04:44.230> that<00:04:44.290> solution<00:04:44.590> again<00:04:45.370> you

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
I'm happy with that solution again you

I'm happy with that solution again you
actually<00:04:46.000> cannot<00:04:46.300> see<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.830> cigars<00:04:48.190> on

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
actually cannot see that one cigars on

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.370 
actually cannot see that one cigars on
the<00:04:48.580> side<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:49.750> would<00:04:49.840> never<00:04:50.020> know<00:04:50.170> it's<00:04:50.320> there

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
the side you would never know it's there

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.000 
the side you would never know it's there
anyway

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
as you can see how it's it tied it on

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.840 
as you can see how it's it tied it on
I've<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.380> removed<00:04:53.980> all<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.460> other<00:04:54.580> things

wonderful so here's the hard drive bays
three<00:05:04.420> of<00:05:04.510> which<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:04.990> got<00:05:05.290> two<00:05:05.590> three<00:05:05.860> terabyte

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
three of which I got two three terabyte

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.050 
three of which I got two three terabyte
hard<00:05:06.490> drives

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
hard drives

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.740 
hard drives
they<00:05:07.870> just<00:05:08.080> pop<00:05:08.350> out<00:05:08.470> like<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:10.420> put<00:05:10.600> it<00:05:10.690> in

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
there with why these rubber Bunnings or

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.610 
there with why these rubber Bunnings or
hard<00:05:12.550> drives<00:05:12.820> in<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.660> then<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.080> just<00:05:14.110> slide

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
hard drives in and then you just slide

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.580 
hard drives in and then you just slide
them<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:15.660> there<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.750> go<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:17.230> slide<00:05:17.500> them

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
in it is easy to do it's because I'm at

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.110 
in it is easy to do it's because I'm at
an<00:05:19.330> awkward<00:05:19.450> angle<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:21.430> then<00:05:21.640> I'll<00:05:21.790> show<00:05:22.030> you

they just like this for yes I can cast

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.080 
they just like this for yes I can cast
two<00:06:05.230> forward<00:06:05.650> at<00:06:05.770> least<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:07.330> there<00:06:07.600> it<00:06:08.410> is

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
two forward at least and there it is

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.190 
two forward at least and there it is
it's<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.210> wonderful<00:06:11.160> subtle<00:06:12.160> look<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.930> glass

it's a wonderful subtle look the glass

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.330 
it's a wonderful subtle look the glass
is<00:06:14.440> really<00:06:14.590> high-quality

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
is really high-quality

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.190 
practicality mmm 7 out of 10 cooling
well<00:06:50.590> that's<00:06:50.860> unfortunate<00:06:51.130> a<00:06:51.370> bit<00:06:51.520> low<00:06:52.080> 46<00:06:53.080> and

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
well that's unfortunate a bit low 46 and

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.150 
well that's unfortunate a bit low 46 and
a<00:06:53.230> half<00:06:53.440> out<00:06:53.650> of<00:06:53.680> 10

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
a half out of 10

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.790 
a half out of 10
however<00:06:54.820> you<00:06:55.180> can<00:06:55.390> solve<00:06:55.750> it<00:06:55.960> with<00:06:56.560> a<00:06:56.620> bit<00:06:56.710> of

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
however you can solve it with a bit of

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.210 
however you can solve it with a bit of
ingenuity<00:06:57.130> like<00:06:57.520> I<00:06:57.700> have<00:06:58.980> probably<00:06:59.980> if<00:07:00.130> you

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
ingenuity like I have probably if you

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.970 
ingenuity like I have probably if you
put<00:07:00.400> an<00:07:00.490> extra<00:07:00.669> filing<00:07:01.500> puts<00:07:02.500> it<00:07:02.590> back<00:07:02.680> up<00:07:02.860> to

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
put an extra filing puts it back up to

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.820 
put an extra filing puts it back up to
about<00:07:03.100> 8<00:07:03.250> and<00:07:03.280> a<00:07:03.460> half<00:07:03.490> I<00:07:04.320> would<00:07:05.320> recommend<00:07:05.710> one

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
about 8 and a half I would recommend one

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.740 
about 8 and a half I would recommend one
that<00:07:06.460> just<00:07:06.610> is<00:07:06.760> something<00:07:07.000> different<00:07:07.270> and<00:07:07.570> it

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
that just is something different and it

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.470 
that just is something different and it
looks<00:07:07.990> really<00:07:08.350> classy<00:07:08.610> it's<00:07:09.610> really<00:07:09.970> nice
