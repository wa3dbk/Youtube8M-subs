00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
I'm going to be going over the concept

features ever since hoppers were

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.090 
features ever since hoppers were
introduced<00:00:18.810> everybody's<00:00:19.500> been<00:00:19.529> trying<00:00:19.920> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
introduced everybody's been trying to

introduced everybody's been trying to
make<00:00:20.279> fully<00:00:20.939> automated<00:00:21.300> growing<00:00:21.930> systems

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
make fully automated growing systems

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.359 
make fully automated growing systems
mine<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> different<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.920> doesn't<00:00:26.220> use

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
mine is different because it doesn't use

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.890 
mine is different because it doesn't use
any<00:00:26.580> water<00:00:27.140> dispensers<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.740> rail<00:00:29.699> cards<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
any water dispensers or rail cards it

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.430 
any water dispensers or rail cards it
just<00:00:31.140> uses<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.619> fact<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.430> snapshot

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
just uses to the fact that in snapshot

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.799 
just uses to the fact that in snapshot
13w<00:00:34.440> too<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> control<00:00:35.550> hoppers<00:00:36.000> with

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
13w too we can you control hoppers with

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.990 
13w too we can you control hoppers with
redstone<00:00:37.230> power<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.280> short<00:00:38.640> pulse

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
redstone power now and a short pulse

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000 
redstone power now and a short pulse
will<00:00:39.809> cause<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.950> spit<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:42.030> item<00:00:46.010> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
will cause them to spit out one item and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.690 
will cause them to spit out one item and
also<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:47.870> brewing<00:00:48.870> stands<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:50.309> accept

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
also now brewing stands will accept

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.810 
also now brewing stands will accept
bottles<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> back<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.820> ingredients

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
bottles from the back and ingredients

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
bottles from the back and ingredients
from<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> top<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.590> not

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
from the top so you can get that to not

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
from the top so you can get that to not
interfere<00:00:57.680> that's<00:00:58.680> automated<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.750> dumps

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
interfere that's automated so it dumps

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.250 
interfere that's automated so it dumps
the<00:01:02.100> bottles<00:01:02.489> out<00:01:02.640> fills<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.780> starts

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the bottles out fills it up and starts

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.880 
the bottles out fills it up and starts
going<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:05.180> no<00:01:06.180> further<00:01:06.540> interaction

change<00:01:12.049> ingredients<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.200> any<00:01:13.470> time<00:01:15.049> because

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
change ingredients at any time because

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.210 
change ingredients at any time because
it<00:01:16.290> leads<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:18.299> doesn't<00:01:18.799> queue<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.950> next

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it leads to it doesn't queue up the next

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
it leads to it doesn't queue up the next
potion<00:01:20.610> until<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:21.180> ones<00:01:21.390> done<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.080> as

long as you're not trying to change
ingredients<00:01:24.630> when<00:01:24.810> things<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.229> happening<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
ingredients when things are happening it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.249 
ingredients when things are happening it
doesn't<00:01:26.400> matter<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> don't

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
doesn't matter and you know you don't

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
doesn't matter and you know you don't
want<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> say<00:01:29.360> two<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> those<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
want to say two of those because that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.410 
want to say two of those because that
will<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.200> break<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> make<00:01:33.390> sure

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
will just break it you want to make sure

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
will just break it you want to make sure
you're<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:34.320> making<00:01:34.740> potions<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.400> can

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're actually making potions that can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.380 
you're actually making potions that can
be<00:01:35.850> made<00:01:41.210> now<00:01:42.210> storage<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.869> pretty<00:01:43.079> simple

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
be made now storage is pretty simple

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.780 
be made now storage is pretty simple
thanks<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.570> above

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.840 

and<00:01:53.600> how<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.470> works<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.340> same<00:01:58.580> this

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
and how it works this is the same this

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.520 
and how it works this is the same this
is<00:01:58.970> my<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.150> concept<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.900> built<00:02:00.170> before<00:02:00.350> I

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
is my the concept I built before I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.510 
is my the concept I built before I
actually<00:02:01.060> put<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.090> into<00:02:02.270> use<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:04.400> ingredients

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
actually put it into use the ingredients

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.320 
actually put it into use the ingredients
hopper<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.990> comparator<00:02:06.650> off<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.730> there's

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
hopper as a comparator off of it there's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.370 
hopper as a comparator off of it there's
anything<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.259> that<00:02:09.619> not<00:02:09.800> will<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.040> on<00:02:11.380> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
anything in this that not will be on the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.120 
anything in this that not will be on the
purring<00:02:12.650> station<00:02:13.070> if<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:15.320> only<00:02:15.590> contains

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
purring station if it only contains

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.400 
purring station if it only contains
three<00:02:16.430> water<00:02:16.670> bottles<00:02:16.790> than<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:17.870> comparator

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
three water bottles than this comparator

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.890 
three water bottles than this comparator
will<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.680> off<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.240> contains<00:02:20.570> more<00:02:20.840> than

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
will be off but if it contains more than

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.540 
will be off but if it contains more than
three<00:02:21.230> water<00:02:21.440> bottles<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:22.310> know<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
three water bottles you know the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.350 
three water bottles you know the
ingredient<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.459> on<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.060> if

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
ingredient then this will be on so if

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.610 
ingredient then this will be on so if
both<00:02:26.690> these<00:02:26.959> are<00:02:27.140> off<00:02:27.350> then<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.550> torch<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:28.970> on

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
both these are off then this torch is on

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.300 
both these are off then this torch is on
which<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.650> turns<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.970> off<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.600> this<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
which that turns that off and this is a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.000 
which that turns that off and this is a
monostable<00:02:34.310> circuit<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.930> puts<00:02:36.410> out<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> 12

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
monostable circuit and it puts out a 12

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.120 
monostable circuit and it puts out a 12
tick<00:02:37.430> pulse<00:02:38.260> which<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:39.470> goes<00:02:39.680> over<00:02:39.830> here

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
tick pulse which then goes over here

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.630 
tick pulse which then goes over here
turns<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:40.700> torch<00:02:41.150> off<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:42.830> allows

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
turns this torch off which then allows

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.710 
turns this torch off which then allows
this<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.300> suck<00:02:44.600> out<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:46.420> ingredients<00:02:47.420> from

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
this to suck out the ingredients from

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.610 
this to suck out the ingredients from
the<00:02:48.050> hopper<00:02:48.500> while<00:02:48.890> simultaneously<00:02:50.620> turning

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.270 
the hopper while simultaneously turning
this<00:02:52.370> hopper<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:53.350> or<00:02:54.350> turning<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.890> off<00:02:55.040> by

this hopper on or turning it off by

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.240 
this hopper on or turning it off by
giving<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.640> power<00:02:55.850> it's<00:02:56.540> kind<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.780> beard

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
giving it power it's kind of beard

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.270 
giving it power it's kind of beard
keeping<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.430> from<00:02:59.440> giving<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.980> brewing

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
keeping it from giving the brewing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:14.500 
keeping it from giving the brewing
station<00:03:01.580> its<00:03:02.480> Titans

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.309 

it<00:03:15.170> bugged<00:03:15.620> out<00:03:15.799> but<00:03:16.069> it's<00:03:16.519> only<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:17.140> trial<00:03:18.140> as

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
it bugged out but it's only a trial as

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.259 
it bugged out but it's only a trial as
long<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.739> works<00:03:18.860> for<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.129> main<00:03:19.280> thing<00:03:19.519> that

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
long as it works for the main thing that

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.340 
long as it works for the main thing that
happens

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.860 

yeah<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:27.760> oceans<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:28.850> collect<00:03:29.360> in<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.600> chest

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
yeah so oceans just collect in the chest

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.690 
yeah so oceans just collect in the chest
and<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.350> just<00:03:30.560> keeps<00:03:30.860> on<00:03:31.100> chugging<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:37.430> course

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
and it just keeps on chugging of course

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.610 
and it just keeps on chugging of course
your<00:03:37.850> major<00:03:38.060> limiting<00:03:38.450> factors<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.250> have

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
your major limiting factors you can have

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.100 
your major limiting factors you can have
expand<00:03:42.620> storage<00:03:42.890> significantly<00:03:43.670> for<00:03:43.970> the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
expand storage significantly for the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.860 
expand storage significantly for the
bottles<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:45.260> everything<00:03:45.620> else<00:03:45.800> tax<00:03:46.870> fairly

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
bottles but everything else tax fairly

00:03:47.870 --> 00:04:04.390 
bottles but everything else tax fairly
well

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.740 

that's<00:04:05.400> very<00:04:05.490> compact

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.040 

and<00:04:11.380> these<00:04:11.530> are<00:04:11.590> all<00:04:11.940> one<00:04:12.940> tick<00:04:13.180> delays<00:04:13.570> just

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
and these are all one tick delays just

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.090 
and these are all one tick delays just
tons<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.590> repeaters<00:04:15.030> just<00:04:16.030> kind<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.269> spam<00:04:16.540> them

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
tons of repeaters just kind of spam them

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.330 
tons of repeaters just kind of spam them
they<00:04:18.100> can<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.579> take<00:04:18.760> delays<00:04:19.769> earlier<00:04:20.769> as<00:04:21.160> I

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
they can be to take delays earlier as I

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.910 
they can be to take delays earlier as I
change<00:04:21.970> them<00:04:22.150> from<00:04:22.450> nice<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> little<00:04:23.830> bit

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
change them from nice a little bit

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.730 
change them from nice a little bit
earlier<00:04:24.250> but<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.900> can't<00:04:26.140> have<00:04:26.260> four<00:04:26.530> tick

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
earlier but you can't have four tick

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.350 
earlier but you can't have four tick
delays<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.220> that'll<00:04:27.580> make<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.760> spit<00:04:28.330> out

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
delays because that'll make it spit out

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.260 
delays because that'll make it spit out
more<00:04:28.660> than<00:04:28.810> one<00:04:28.960> item<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.730> you<00:04:30.850> have<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.150> make

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
more than one item so you have to make

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.420 
more than one item so you have to make
sure<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:32.080> pulse<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.620> goes<00:04:32.830> through<00:04:33.160> is

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
sure the the pulse that goes through is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.260 
sure the the pulse that goes through is
very<00:04:33.790> short<00:04:34.210> as<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.960> just<00:04:35.200> salt<00:04:35.880> actually<00:04:36.880> so

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
very short as you just salt actually so

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.250 
very short as you just salt actually so
that<00:04:37.780> means<00:04:38.020> it's<00:04:38.170> now<00:04:38.350> working<00:04:38.560> on<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.980> next

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
that means it's now working on the next

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.440 
that means it's now working on the next
potion<00:04:41.260> back<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.460> serving<00:04:42.760> melons<00:04:43.150> in<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
potion back to the serving melons in the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.830 
potion back to the serving melons in the
health<00:04:43.600> potion<00:04:46.650> thanks<00:04:47.650> for<00:04:47.770> watching
