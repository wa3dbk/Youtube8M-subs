Hello everybody! Welcome to my new tutorial
which is the number 12!

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.000
I am happy to be with you today for this new
tutorial which will be a sewing tutorial.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Today, we are using our sewing machine to
sew a tote bag.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.100
For those of you who don't know what it is. A tote bag is very trendy, it's very simple and helpful. It's composed of two sides and is used to tote things on it.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.000
This tutorial is very simple to do.
Here are the accessories you will need

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
A pair of scissors
Pins

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.300
A piece of fabric
A second piece of fabric

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.000
The pattern of the tote bag

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:06.100
Some advices before we start.
You will realize that you need bigger pieces of fabric, compared to my last tutorials, as the bow ties one or the collars one.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.800

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.100
For the pattern, you can download it with
the link in the description, below my video.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.000
I think I don't have anything to add.
Let's start this tutorial!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Like you noticed, our pattern is composed
of two parts. The first one for the handle and the second one for the front and back of the tote bag.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.300

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:55.300
Then I will have a bicolor bag.
If you want a plain tote bag, you can also do it!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:05.900
I need to pin the pattern on the first fabric, before pining it on the second one and cut.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.900

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.000
I repeat the same actions on the second fabric.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.100
Pieces for the front and back of my tote bag
are ready.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.000
I start cutting the handle.
As I decided to do a bicolor tote bag, I do

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.100
the same for the handle.
You need to cut twice with this pattern.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.100
I will cut into the first fabric, and then into
the second one.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.500
Here are our two handles, the back and the
front of our tote bag. We can start the sewing!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.000
First : we sew the sides of the handles so
they won't fray.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:39.600
Now, we pin the front and the back of our
tote bag. Pin the fabrics back to back.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.620

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
First, don't forget not to sew the top of
the fabric. It will be the opening side of your bag.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.230
The two parts are sewed. We can now sew the sides, side by side.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.200

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:38.000
Last step : leave every piece on their backs,
position the handles and pin them on the bag.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Sew them, and it's the last step of our tutorial.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Our tote bag is done. I'm sure you can't wait
to see the result, so let's go!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.200
As you noticed if you watch regularly my tutorials, I used the same fabric for my tote bag as the one I used in my tutorial where I customized sleeves of a shirt.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.500
I have to admit that I really like the pattern
of this fabric.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:24.800
I figured out it would be nice to use it again for the tote bag.
I am really happy with my result. I hope you will be too if you try to do this tutorial.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.000
If you have questions, you can leave me a comment. I will answer it as quickly as I can.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Last weekend, I went to Paris and did some
exhibitions. I also went to the Biennale in Lyon.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.500
If you are interested to know what I thought, you can go on my blog where I've written two posts about my thoughts.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.500

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.500
I hope you will have a great weekend.
I see you very soon for a new tutorial.
Bye everyone!
