Hey everyone! This is Jessica from JewelryTutorialHQ.com
and BespangledBeads.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.160
Today I'm going to show you how to use a crimping
tool to finish your beaded jewelry.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.150
First, I'm going to show you why you would
want to use a crimping tool.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.329
This is a traditional method for crimping
a crimp tube, using chain nosed pliers and

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.449
just squeezing the crimp tube flat.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.940
And that works well, but one thing I don't
like about it is that it leaves sharp edges.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.149
These corners can scratch you on your neck
or on your arm and it can be really uncomfortable.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.059
Using this crimping tool can help you get
a nicer finished look so we can make a nice

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.199
round crimped crimp on the end

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.199
and cover that with a crimp cover, which will
also make it a lot more comfortable.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.690
Starting with a beaded strand,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.690
pass the stringing material through the loop,
or chain, or clasp or whatever it is you want

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.770
to attach it to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.130
and then pass it back through the crimp tube
that you strung on the end of the strand.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.130
Now pull the short end tight - we want it
pretty tight up against the ring.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.000
I usually use my chain nosed pliers to get
a better grip and pull it pretty tight.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.119
Now using the crimping tool - the back part
of the jaws where you see that little bump

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:39.450
-

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.140
place it around the crimp tube and squeeze
it one time.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.430
You should end up with something that looks
like this, with a little crease in one side.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.430
Now using the front part of the jaws this
time, take the crease you made on the crimp

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.219
tube and face it toward the back of the plier
jaws

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.320
so it's facing the hand that's holding the
pliers.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.320
And you're going to squeeze and fold that
crimp in half.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.480
And then turn it and squeeze again, and turn
it and squeeze again.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.900
Now you should have a nicely rounded crimp
tube.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.550
Simply trim off the excess stringing material
using your flush cutters,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.190
slide down the beads,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.550
and we're going to repeat the process on the
other end.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.030
You want to make sure your beads are tight
so there won't be any spaces between them

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.080
but it should still be able to move.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.480
Slide on a crimp tube -

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.480
I'm using 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter crimp
tubes. There are lots of different sizes,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.720
and it's important to note that different
sized crimp tubes will use a different size

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.560
crimping tool.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.860
I'll have more information about that in the
notes

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.610
so please be sure, before you buy a tool if
you don't have one already that you're getting

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.610
the right one

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.770
or you get the right crimp tubes for the tool
that you have.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.410
So this time since we've already strung the
other end I'm holding this a bit differently.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.120
I'm holding the crimp tube against the beads
because I don't want that to move

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.590
and I'm pulling the end tight.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.620
I'm going to check my tension again, here.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.290
It's a little bit tight, so I'm just going
to loosen it up before I crimp it

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.150
If it's too tight - if there's too much tension
- your strand can break.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.090
Again, using the back part of the crimp tool

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.090
I'm going to make that little crease by squeezing
it one time.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.200
Face that crease toward the back of the plier
jaws or toward the hand that's holding the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.310
pliers

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.870
and using the end part of the tool this time

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.790
squeeze to fold that crimp over

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.959
and then release and turn and squeeze, release
and turn and keep doing that all the way around

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.129
until you have a nicely rounded crimp tube.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.110
So now we've got a finished strand

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.199
and this is actually going to be part of a
multistrand necklace so

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.550
that's why it looks a little funny that there's
only one strand on this big ring

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.370
This is a crimp cover -

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.770
these are 3 millimeter crimp covers

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.770
and you just slide it over the crimp tube
and using the crimping tool again for this

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.620
just gently squeeze

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.939
it around the crimp

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:02.569
And this leaves us with a really nicely finished
end on the strand.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.569
Which I think looks a whole lot better than
just a flat squished crimp tube.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.860
Thanks so much for joining me today!
