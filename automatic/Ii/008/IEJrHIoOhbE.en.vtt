00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.799
 to make our pride that to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.010
 build our revenue 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:19.470
 we're going to use 150 grams and hastily 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.740

 Breading our steaks we'll use 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.299
 wheat flour August thread flour 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.040
 I like two whole eggs 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.710
 So is this our ingredients for 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.570
 we make our recipe well stay 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.659
 parmegiana 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.399
 We'll mix it in a pot all 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 the ingredients we talked about 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.780
 season our biffi 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:55.310
 we put the olive oil Worcestershire sauce 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 powdered meat seasoning 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.020
 we blend well we do in crime 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.730
 It seems like a few people but they are not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.090
 even to meet a pound of cargo 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.760
 quiet to season our flesh 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.580
 We we doing so O face 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.890
 with the seasoned hand and we're catching it 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.430
 this year 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.840
 The more we get, the better to cut. 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.490
 in the flesh take the seasoning you have to go 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.490
 far from having a show options 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.590
 Now we're going to fool our hearts. 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:43.720
 we took two eggs falling apart in 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:51.910
 plate and then tapped slightly to 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.490
 the axes are we marched two eggs 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.570
 a tip we're good to do 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.520
 that 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.520
 mix two tablespoons of milk 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.380
 too much tone makes it much easier to 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.380
 stop 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:18.830
 we passed the new steak if we ran 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.830
 we pass on wheat flour 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:31.040
 we pass again again and now passing 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.730
 in the flour 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.730
 we chose the flour well 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.819
 I'll reserve the ones we'll do this way with 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.549
 all the benefits to then we 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.160
 we finish frying our steaks 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.230
 Now we're going to face them. 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.660
 put the oil in the pan enough 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.620
 to tell us about breaded steak 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.930
 we hope it looks like being a little bit 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.180
 not to know the oil temperature 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.230
 we took a wooden spoon and 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.100
 so we bubble like that in the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.410
 Grandma's corner watching is that the 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.000
 temperature is great to be able to stay 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.150
 our biffi 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.579
 so we'll put the first bug 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.949
 to fry 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.740
 we hope to fry on one side after 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:28.729
 of years play on the other side and 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.729
 removing them provided by both sides 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:39.139
 the agreement of the paper towel now thanks 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.849
 beach club 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.960
 So we ended up facing our 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.830
 steaks 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.710
 now we'll make our eye on 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.659
 a pot we'll put two 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.139
 spoons of olive oil 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:05:01.699
 We hope there is to be a little bit now. 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:11.740
 we throw the onion shut by the drug 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:11.740
 adding chili homemade tomato 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:26.530
 and now in the selection of back smoke people 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.260
 adds the smell came here and now 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.150
 I'm throwing a glass of water now. 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.460
 glass of water 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.960
 we'll let cooking here has 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:41.980
 shelter to thicken our broth here 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.310
 people our eye got the fire low 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.260
 has stayed pretty consistent we are the 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.150
 wanting to drop from the bottom of the pan 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.700
 It's so after insistent crouching without 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.370
 play on the bottom of the pan 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.120
 they are the fire and now we are going to show 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.410
 Our weak but let's put the beaks 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:09.360
 in the bottom of the form now over the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.360
 steaks we'll put one eye 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.900
 now we're going to put a layer of 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.960

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.039
