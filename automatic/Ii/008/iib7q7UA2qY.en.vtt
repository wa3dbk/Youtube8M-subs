00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.130
 you wanted friends and friends 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.650
 for dyn it is a true honor 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.990
 rendered today a meaningful tribute 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.749
 to the fire brigades of chile 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:11.599
 It's a new anniversary 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.499
 of its foundation happened 1851 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.699
 in the port of ValparaÃ­so 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.089
 nowadays 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.929
 they are about 3 100 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.960
 the fire departments 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.339
 what they serve throughout the national territory 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.339
 with its almost 25 thousand volunteers 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.220
 four thousand of which only 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.100
 women 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 he sent you today a message of affection and gratitude 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.380
 for those who dedicate their lives 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.360
 makes floor 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.960
 wolf but they also have 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.720
 the concept of patriotism 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 the uncle of the right 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.240
 when I asked for the sturdy one and everyone looks for 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.840
 the way out 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 the firemen look for the way to enter 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.290
 while everyone tries to escape from danger 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.650
 they prefer to stay in attack 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 while the rest looks for their own security 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.750
 firefighters 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.120
 they risk to give 4 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.750
 to others 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.130
 I feel we are in debt with eight 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.940
 the current budget law 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.510
 contemplates a contribution 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.170
 of only 15 billion pesos 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.490
 that is, less than one thousand pesos for each chile 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.190
 this does not even cover 30% of your operational expenses 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.620
 in protocol 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.140
 we will triple that contribution 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 to ensure coverage inc 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 of all operational expenses 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.760
 the necessary renovation 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.350
 it's a machineries 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.100
 we have also proposed 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.760
 solve the gral 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.840
 of shortages in life insurance and samu 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.610
 advancing in the processing of a framework law for firefighters 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.629
 that tablets recognition 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.049
 a ticket the health and life insurance you need 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.929
 and support the training 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 and the permanent improvement 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.769
 since the rescue procedures 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.849
 and the fight against fires 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.309
 the Celtic emergencies have been becoming more and more common 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.799
 what will end these words 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.309
 without making a sense of homage 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:44.039
 to the 287 martÃ­nez of the fire departments of chile that has fallen 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.419
 fulfilling his duty 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.579
 it is often said that they lost their lives 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.679
 the fulfillment of his 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.999
 but the truth 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.549
 I'm far from losing 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.259
 what they did was so much to others 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.389
 fulfilling 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.689
 the noble task of adjustment 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.539
 your service example 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.469
 delivery commits us all 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.159
 deep
