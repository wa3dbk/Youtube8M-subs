00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
bag this retains the heat and speeds up

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.949 
bag this retains the heat and speeds up
the<00:02:46.010> process<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:47.000> I'm<00:02:47.180> not<00:02:47.450> actually<00:02:47.600> going

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the process but I'm not actually going

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.229 
the process but I'm not actually going
to<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.470> I'm<00:02:48.740> just<00:02:49.670> going<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.880> wait<00:02:50.090> like

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
to do this I'm just going to wait like

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.410 
to do this I'm just going to wait like
this<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:52.100> dark<00:02:52.250> voice<00:02:52.550> doing<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.060> but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
this a really dark voice doing this but

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420 
this a really dark voice doing this but
I<00:02:53.540> can't<00:02:53.810> afford<00:02:53.900> no<00:02:54.200> extension<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:54.980> have<00:02:55.190> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
I can't afford no extension so I have to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.820

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.220 
I'm going to bleach my extensions as
well<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.360> pretty<00:02:59.540> much<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.810> same<00:03:00.050> as

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
well so it's pretty much the same as

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.930 
well so it's pretty much the same as
what<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.350> do<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> your<00:03:00.770> hair<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.220> wet<00:03:01.670> them

and squeeze the excess water out and

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.010 
and squeeze the excess water out and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.690 

then<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.260> need<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.530> do<00:03:09.710> is<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.280> lie<00:03:10.490> them

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.890 
then all you need to do is just lie them
flat<00:03:10.940> somewhere<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.810> get<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.860> mixture<00:03:13.220> and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
make sure that it's evenly spread out

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.360 
make sure that it's evenly spread out
throughout<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.820> extension<00:03:17.630> like<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:21.370> once

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120

like after I'd washed the bleach out and

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.080 
like after I'd washed the bleach out and

Ozzy's<00:04:00.980> leave-in<00:04:01.430> conditioner<00:04:02.120> I'm<00:04:02.740> going<00:04:03.740> to

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
Ozzy's leave-in conditioner I'm going to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
leave these in for a few hours to try

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.600

and get my hair feeling good again and

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.490 
and get my hair feeling good again and
once<00:04:10.610> I've<00:04:10.790> washed<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.360> out<00:04:11.660> then<00:04:12.230> I'm<00:04:12.350> going

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
once I've washed it out then I'm going

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.210 
once I've washed it out then I'm going
to<00:04:12.560> turn<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.860> with<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.010> silver<00:04:13.190> shampoo<00:04:15.220> so

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
to turn it with the silver shampoo so

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.699 
to turn it with the silver shampoo so
after<00:04:16.760> I'd<00:04:16.850> use<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> silver<00:04:17.510> shampoo<00:04:17.930> my<00:04:18.680> hair

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
after I'd use the silver shampoo my hair

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.880 
after I'd use the silver shampoo my hair
looked<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.459> this<00:04:19.870> which<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:21.020> quite<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.560> light

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
looked like this which is quite a light

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.400 
looked like this which is quite a light
yellow<00:04:22.130> I'm<00:04:22.520> very<00:04:23.240> happy<00:04:23.510> with

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.580 

I<00:04:29.260> used<00:04:30.260> blue<00:04:30.770> hair<00:04:31.250> dye<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:32.260> mix<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.470> with

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
I used blue hair dye and mix it with

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.520 
I used blue hair dye and mix it with
pink<00:04:34.070> hair<00:04:34.400> dye<00:04:34.750> because<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.990> didn't<00:04:36.410> actually

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
pink hair dye because I didn't actually

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.140 
pink hair dye because I didn't actually
have<00:04:36.800> any<00:04:36.830> purple<00:04:37.370> which<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.700> what<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:37.970> need

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
have any purple which is what you need

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.660 
have any purple which is what you need
so<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.140> mix<00:04:39.410> them<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.680> make<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> purple<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.490> then

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
so I mix them to make a purple and then

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.180 
so I mix them to make a purple and then
mix<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.210> with<00:04:41.630> conditioner<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.680> lighten<00:04:43.100> it

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
mix it with conditioner to lighten it

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.160 
mix it with conditioner to lighten it
otherwise<00:04:44.150> my<00:04:44.330> hair<00:04:44.480> will<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:44.750> ended<00:04:45.080> up

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
otherwise my hair will just ended up

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.160 
otherwise my hair will just ended up
purple<00:04:45.890> so<00:04:46.760> this<00:04:46.970> is<00:04:47.150> what<00:04:47.420> you<00:04:47.720> end<00:04:47.960> up<00:04:48.110> with

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
purple so this is what you end up with

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.070 
purple so this is what you end up with
ideally<00:04:49.130> just<00:04:49.160> by<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.820> violet<00:04:50.540> dye<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:51.050> mix

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
ideally just by a violet dye and mix

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.650 
ideally just by a violet dye and mix
with<00:04:51.770> conditioner<00:04:52.310> but<00:04:52.730> this<00:04:52.910> works<00:04:53.180> just<00:04:53.450> as

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
with conditioner but this works just as

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.280 
with conditioner but this works just as
well<00:04:53.690> because<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.290> is<00:04:54.320> exactly<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.920> same<00:04:55.100> and

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
well because it is exactly the same and

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:05.160 
well because it is exactly the same and
just<00:04:57.290> cover<00:04:57.560> your<00:04:57.830> hair<00:04:58.100> in<00:04:58.250> it

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.800 

I<00:05:05.580> realize<00:05:06.580> halfway<00:05:06.940> through<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.690> would

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
I realize halfway through it would

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.870 
I realize halfway through it would
probably<00:05:08.020> be<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.350> lot<00:05:08.500> easier<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:09.070> apply<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:09.700> I

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
probably be a lot easier to apply if I

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.120 
probably be a lot easier to apply if I
wet<00:05:10.090> my<00:05:10.210> hair<00:05:10.420> so<00:05:11.350> I've<00:05:11.500> just<00:05:11.530> got<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.890> make<00:05:11.920> my

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
wet my hair so I've just got to make my

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.660 
wet my hair so I've just got to make my
hair<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.720> I'm<00:05:13.720> now<00:05:13.900> carrying<00:05:14.350> on<00:05:14.530> applying<00:05:15.460> it

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
hair and I'm now carrying on applying it

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.740 
hair and I'm now carrying on applying it
you<00:05:16.180> should<00:05:16.360> go<00:05:16.900> on<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:17.110> lot<00:05:17.200> more<00:05:17.380> smoother

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.980 

I'm<00:05:21.650> just<00:05:22.100> combing<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.640> mixture<00:05:23.030> through<00:05:23.390> so

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
I'm just combing the mixture through so

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.530 
I'm just combing the mixture through so
that<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:24.200> get<00:05:24.470> even<00:05:24.890> coverage<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.820> make<00:05:26.300> sure

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
that I get even coverage and make sure

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.090 
that I get even coverage and make sure
that<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.810> haven't<00:05:27.080> missed<00:05:27.230> any<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:29.920> once<00:05:30.920> my

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
that I haven't missed any and once my

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.130 
that I haven't missed any and once my
hair<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.400> covered<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:31.970> left<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.540> on<00:05:32.630> for

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
hair is covered I left it on for

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.940 
hair is covered I left it on for
approximately<00:05:34.420> two<00:05:35.420> hours<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:38.500> this<00:05:39.500> was<00:05:39.830> the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
approximately two hours and this was the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.780 
approximately two hours and this was the
final<00:05:40.280> result<00:05:40.400> my<00:05:40.970> hair<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.450> really<00:05:42.170> light

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
final result my hair is really light

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.790 
final result my hair is really light
it's<00:05:43.790> a<00:05:43.970> little<00:05:44.210> bit<00:05:44.300> patchy<00:05:44.510> in<00:05:44.870> places<00:05:45.440> and

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
it's a little bit patchy in places and

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.850 
it's a little bit patchy in places and
some<00:05:46.220> places<00:05:46.460> are<00:05:46.790> more<00:05:46.910> likely<00:05:47.180> than<00:05:47.450> others

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
some places are more likely than others

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.050 
some places are more likely than others
but<00:05:48.860> overall<00:05:49.100> I<00:05:49.700> am<00:05:50.060> happy<00:05:50.360> with<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:50.630> results
