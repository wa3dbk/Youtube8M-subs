00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.220
 The discussion about the beam also in the Netherlands will be continued 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.619
 lierse marleen veldhuis in the suit of the italian brand insured 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.209
 that is entered in the population register during the final of 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.449
 the 50 meter butterfly it is actually a nickname for marleen veldhuis 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.779
 but she is also in blood form 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.319
 and to what extent does money play babcock than normal 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.519
 take this great achievement will drop sea is on its way after the 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.800
 improving the world record 25 46 she was assigned as of bark 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.390
 was found in barcelona last year 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.780
 applies there 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 field house new accommodation 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.640
 25 33 a new world record while it doesn't even come out that well 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.970
 it's a big surprise she has to wait a long time until she finally knows lothar 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 time and then the discharge 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.530
 I didn't look, he says 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.740
 I have I have not sure 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.310
 he is trying to be his 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.309
 from its own audience this is a brand 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.350
 the beautiful series 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.960
 actually it was not really sitting in a short time 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 find anita idea 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.720
 but they must therefore be low 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 and then I am too strong for a fourth place 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.070
 yes i think i don't know i think i'm buying a great race now 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 but you think you can do better 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.709
 July 31 this has nothing but this is not normal I am standing now 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 yes yes me 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.210
 I miss the internet information have swam very good distances 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.300
 mt 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.180
 he died in the first year so not all ages rise spaces 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 yesterday 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.700
 the final of the 200 meter breaststroke in it is looked at the performance 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
 from lia dekker who is in second place 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.270
 in the lead the swedish jolie numbers koeman 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.110
 in the program offense on the 100 meter breaststroke on which they are based 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.980
 Qualified for the World Cup in Rome now is the goal 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.330
 to set the time of 2 10 58 speed up 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 it will come close to that than I have to be her suppliers 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 improve 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.169
 a hefty lead that will not figure out anymore 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.699
 but there is a new Dutch record open in the month 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.269
 in the summer complaint from 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.100
 certainly 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.059
 which will be discussed a lot this week 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.059
 she was driven but it is not enough to qualify 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.709
 for the wk on this 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.499
 bottles of decisions 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.499
 That is very common coach Jacco Verhaeren 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.379
 the skeleton that stekelenburg for the final of the 100 meter breaststroke 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.799
 actually he is the one 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.129
 this discussion 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.499
 started this morning 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.899
 Stekelenburg swims in lane four between the yellow lines 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.510
 this morning in the normal series 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.740
 the qualifying match won 3 0 in a negative spiral 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.400
 pacovski is also on now 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.440
 but then he decided to swim faithfully to a couple in about two weeks 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.530
 and then the school bus 59 50 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.589
 unheard of quickly 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:16.219
 a dutch record the fifth time ever it is a statement of 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.360
 Stekelenburg who disagrees 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.840
 about the way in which the NFL and in particular technical director jacco 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.509
 hurry up 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.469
 has revelation when it comes to wearing this type of suit 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.639
 matches 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:35.149
 in the lead, yes, another two-week suit by robbie bach alone 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.369
 above 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:38.789
 especially considering road ahead of time 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.799
 a reason 48 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.699
 that is a personal record 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.719
 But that is a while too slow for taking part in the World Cup in Rome 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:52.359
 and because Stekelenburg has already shown its form retention, it does go into this part 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.959
 the wk despite he loses you from the apple 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.219
 so no consequences regarding the result but the discussion about it 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.079
 swimming pool real 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.259
 but good germany now an hour 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.489
 the city 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.659
 ensures that actually discussion outside is not agreed 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.819
 seen 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.949
 but I just think we should be banned through the suit 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.600
 that finds also would only come the platform then from the second to 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.299
 to work 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.759
 it would be a very good cause 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.830
 at the same time competition within the Netherlands with the chosen katie 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.870
 World Cup matches 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.270
 and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.270
 set some more details about it on and on 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.090
 surrounded with advice on actually one 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.490
 rule that there should be work in it anyway the council should be 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.990
 two world records in one day that is possible 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.349
 marleen veldhuis 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.699
 the return of speedo here you first shopkeepers schrÃ¶der 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.189
 velthuizen in lane four 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.819
 schreuder in bases in this final of the 50 meter freestyle 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.740
 actually the favorite part of the sprintster pur sang at home 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.919
 ships full of gas 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:05.889
 adult 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.589
 world record 23 97 in name of preferably records 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:16.469
 Veldhuis set the world record back because here is 23 96 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.469
 two world records in one day for Marleen Veldhuis 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.159
 one hundredth of a second indeed 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:28.999
 how many play 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.409
 I now have the timing 2 to shorten a discussion and 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.210
 but yes who merhi very happy with it and me 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.230
 so it has been said that I can agree 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.990
 yes I have to steam the 50 butterfly too big for that 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.960
 this also very good none that also not yet sick 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.169
 lisse and yes that makes it exciting market to the selection 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.519
 turned out to be
