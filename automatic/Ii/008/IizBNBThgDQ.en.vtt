00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 we could be wrong but this mother 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
 of family settles in his living room 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 with his computer to do his 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.440
 races for six months to leave it 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.509
 the supermarket in favor of orders 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.460
 on the internet that she recovers in 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.949
 withdrawal points called drive 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'm going on the computer when I have a 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.439
 moment and then then well I have the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.029
 time to compare prices per kilogram and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.130
 liter for me it's interesting to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.170
 duty at least in France in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.510
 belgium but for me mother of three 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 kids finished the chore of shopping a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.410
 times her registered order she withdraws 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.510
 his purchases in less than five minutes 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.950
 we'll get the races to come 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.700
 of work and having 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.620
 children at home who load 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.210
 times the caddy while we are 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.910
 in the supermarket there is less 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
 tried and cost economically speaking 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
 it's much more interesting 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.039
 signs for shopping in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 drive have blossomed all over the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.390
 Auchan turf and rations 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.920
 carrefour leclerc casino all 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.970
 big brands are present on this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.080
 market 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.700
 and by the end of the year 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.350
 there will be no less than nine points of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.060
 sale of this kind of which nearly half 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.060
 have opened just this year 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.720
 yet there are still only four 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.790
 years chronodrive it was the only store 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.910
 of touraine to offer this kind of 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:34.880
 service since 2008 on the store of 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.860
 tours our customers have tested and have well 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.930
 been welcomed have found a wide 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.100
 choice and price level if they are 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.590
 found because we have the same prices 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.890
 than that the price range of a 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.479
 hypermarket and so 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.930
 as they liked and well there was a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.659
 word of mouth system and the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.579
 and competitors 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.229
 we wanted to copy if the 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.789
 drive implementations multiply 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.079
 on tours it is especially that the 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.609
 signs want at all costs to be 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.179
 present in this market in full 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.350
 development 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.509
 the new modes of consumption 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.329
 and buying back to the internet 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.159
 at the national level the potential of this 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.259
 market is estimated at nearly 5 billion 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.170
 euros to global france today 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.989
 estimated that about 2% of French who 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.180
 do their shopping in drive and on 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.720
 coming years it's estimated that it's risky 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.269
 to go up to 5 5% 7% on the city 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280
 of laps there are a lot of drive and so 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.170
 is the market saturated we can 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730
 ask yourself a question 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.450
 yet still in the south of 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.819
 the agglomeration 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.890
 a new drive is under construction a 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.599
 project to 3 million euros which will be 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.180
 integrated with the taught auchan room and 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.190
 Here we place on the right to rn10 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.720
 Auchan hypermarket side where we 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.400
 are building a drag 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.379
 for two to three months for a 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.430
 early October delivery in cover 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.650
 to customers early October 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.660
 and even with 3 drive in this sector 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.970
 for the director the market is not 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.920
 saturated because the potential is there a 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.660
 today as drake field at 12000 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.660
 inhabitants also has twelve thousand people 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.220
 who work daily on the area 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.440
 so it is clear that we had you 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.910
 debauched you also want to join 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.450
 your family pretty quickly so the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.799
 having a drive auchan chambray that 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.660
 saves time and money 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.570
 also improve the quality of life 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.070
 of our inhabitants for a drive to be 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.590
 profitable they have to be located 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.420
 on a major road and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.120
 also has a website 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.460
 attractive for the last to arrive on the 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.470
 market last April is profitable 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.720
 it is aiming at â‚¬ 3.5 million of 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.220
 turnover and therefore recorded 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.620
 an average of 200 orders a day 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.420
 a goal that should be achieved 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.280
 for the beginning of September 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 and here's how it goes in the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.730
 backstage of an order so once 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.390
 that the customer has placed his order on 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.670
 Internet 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.940
 this client arrives on our screens this 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.950
 which sets the priority is the time of 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.170
 withdrawal depending on the time of 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.460
 withdrawal of the order 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.710
 our preparers get started right away 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.150
 in action to prepare this command 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.470
 the order arrived on his little 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.790
 scan is she both the address where 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.790
 find the product and quantity 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.209
 here the warehouse is 2000 square meters 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.890
 and has 7000 referenced products that's 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.070
 much less than a hypermarket that 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.570
 count up to 25000 so far this 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.579
 is not easier to manage the stock 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.830
 especially for fresh products 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.020
 which are removed from the sale well before 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.280
 sell-by date 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.260
 the objective guarantee a freshness 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.790
 optimal to customers all that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.060
 regards the fresh produce you have 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.680
 withdrawal times that are a small 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.650
 little more important than in store is at 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 to say that we withdraw 1 to 2 days more 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.240
 early products that what you can 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.780
 have as withdrawal time in store 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.639
 and so that causes a management 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.860
 a lot more sizes it's at each 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.389
 nobody to every manager to be 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.550
 very vigilant about these on his 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.740
 supply and manage at best 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.510
 are its supplies relative 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.720
 to his sees his activity with respect to 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.630
 weekdays and drive are also 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.460
 job creator here to chamber 30 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.039
 full-time equivalent positions go through 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.919
 example be created then the drive the 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.630
 100% positive not so sure because if this 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.950
 new fashion stores and five to six 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.229
 times cheaper to build than a 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.910
 hypermarket the distributors the 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.000
 considers it less profitable than 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.039
 so - called classic supermarket especially in 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.570
 because of the large workforce 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.500
 needed to shop at the 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.229
 customer's place 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.080
 it takes on average 20 to 30 employees to 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.030
 run a drive and side 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.410
 consumers if they save time there 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.539
 do not win every time 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.400
 money for the moment the big ones 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.750
 brands are over represented at 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.750
 detriment of discount products
