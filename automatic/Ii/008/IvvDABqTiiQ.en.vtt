00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I'm kind of curious with the secret

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.870 
I'm kind of curious with the secret
characters<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.769> without<00:01:04.920> further<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.489> further

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
characters so without further a further

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.859 
characters so without further a further
ado<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.390> do<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> skip<00:01:10.320> stay<00:01:10.590> open

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
ado for to do or do do skip stay open

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.780 
ado for to do or do do skip stay open
and<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.590> away<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.189> cut<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> little

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and right away I think it cut the little

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
and right away I think it cut the little
brochure<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:22.040> quick<00:01:23.040> run<00:01:23.280> through

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
brochure in there so quick run through

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.380 
brochure in there so quick run through
key<00:01:23.790> character<00:01:24.390> selection<00:01:26.000> case<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.240> also

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
key character selection case they also

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.469 
key character selection case they also
do<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.869> larger<00:01:28.259> packs<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.479> parts

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

so I just didn't really have any luck
here<00:05:03.630> because<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.320> think<00:05:04.800> any<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.730> ones

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
here because I think any of the ones

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.800 
here because I think any of the ones
below<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.390> would<00:05:06.630> rather<00:05:07.110> had<00:05:07.470> this<00:05:07.950> one<00:05:08.220> and
