00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
play like I can tell you guys that the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.340 
play like I can tell you guys that the
amount<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> free-for-all<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.079> played

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
amount of free-for-all that I've played

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.170 
amount of free-for-all that I've played
and<00:00:40.620> called<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> ghost<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.850> you'd

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and called it a ghost is you know you'd

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
and called it a ghost is you know you'd
count<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:42.780> hand<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.230> really

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
count it on one hand like I really

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.750 
count it on one hand like I really
haven't<00:00:43.800> played<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.100> many<00:00:44.190> matches<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
haven't played that many matches of it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.040 
haven't played that many matches of it
so<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.090> figure<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.629> something<00:00:45.870> cool

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so I figure to be something cool

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.540 
so I figure to be something cool
something<00:00:46.289> new<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> mix<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> up

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

the first I mean I have opted in the six
in<00:06:49.310> a<00:06:49.339> while<00:06:49.459> I've<00:06:49.669> been<00:06:49.789> traveling<00:06:50.209> and<00:06:50.389> for

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
in a while I've been traveling and for

in a while I've been traveling and for
the<00:06:51.259> first<00:06:51.499> episode<00:06:51.649> I<00:06:51.919> don't<00:06:52.099> think<00:06:52.219> that's

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.339 
the first episode I don't think that's

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:53.980 
the first episode I don't think that's
too<00:06:52.490> bad<00:06:52.669> 25<00:06:53.089> and<00:06:53.209> 11<00:06:53.509> I've<00:06:53.599> never<00:06:53.779> really

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
too bad 25 and 11 I've never really

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.389

considered<00:06:54.139> myself<00:06:54.349> a<00:06:54.620> sniper<00:06:54.860> but<00:06:55.099> hopefully

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:55.399 
considered myself a sniper but hopefully

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:56.589 
considered myself a sniper but hopefully
we<00:06:55.490> can<00:06:55.520> continue<00:06:55.969> to<00:06:56.060> get<00:06:56.120> better<00:06:56.270> over<00:06:56.509> the

we can continue to get better over the
series<00:06:56.899> and<00:06:57.889> hopefully<00:06:58.370> it's<00:06:58.490> just<00:06:58.520> something

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819
