a<00:01:41.250> problem<00:01:41.520> getting<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.149> back

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
a problem getting in and out of the back

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.550 
a problem getting in and out of the back
with<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> kids<00:01:42.810> though<00:01:42.960> isn't<00:01:43.109> it<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.380> could

with the kids though isn't it that could
be<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.890> potential<00:01:44.399> problem<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.270> could<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
be a potential problem it could be a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
be a potential problem it could be a
potential<00:01:46.140> problems<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.250> know

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
potential problems I think you know

handles<00:03:21.440> very<00:03:21.680> well<00:03:21.859> on<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.190> road<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.760> feels

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
handles very well on the road it feels

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.640 
handles very well on the road it feels
very<00:03:23.180> sturdy<00:03:24.549> its<00:03:26.169> responsiveness<00:03:27.169> it's<00:03:27.500> not

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
very sturdy its responsiveness it's not

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.319 
very sturdy its responsiveness it's not
too<00:03:27.859> bad<00:03:28.099> considering<00:03:28.549> it's<00:03:28.729> only<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:28.970> 1.6

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
too bad considering it's only a 1.6

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.089 
too bad considering it's only a 1.6
engine<00:03:29.870> yeah<00:03:30.260> it's<00:03:30.379> only<00:03:30.470> got<00:03:30.620> 100<00:03:30.949> brake

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
engine yeah it's only got 100 brake

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.800 
engine yeah it's only got 100 brake
horsepower<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:31.909> it's<00:03:32.030> not<00:03:32.419> going<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.599> set<00:03:32.750> the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
horsepower so it's not going to set the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.199 
horsepower so it's not going to set the
world<00:03:33.019> on<00:03:33.169> fire<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.829> mean<00:03:33.979> you<00:03:34.069> could<00:03:34.250> go<00:03:34.459> if

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
world on fire but I mean you could go if

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.430 
world on fire but I mean you could go if
you<00:03:35.299> wanted<00:03:35.479> a<00:03:35.569> bit<00:03:35.690> more<00:03:35.810> power<00:03:36.049> go<00:03:36.229> for<00:03:36.379> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
you wanted a bit more power go for the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.490 
you wanted a bit more power go for the
1.8<00:03:37.010> or<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.340> 1.8<00:03:37.729> turbos<00:03:38.180> as<00:03:38.359> well<00:03:38.569> what<00:03:39.349> about

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
1.8 or the 1.8 turbos as well what about

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.990 
1.8 or the 1.8 turbos as well what about
the<00:03:39.590> size<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.040> car<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.609> this<00:03:40.790> big

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
the size of the car is is this big

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.219 
the size of the car is is this big
enough<00:03:41.180> for<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:41.599> you<00:03:41.659> think<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:42.079> got

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.229 
enough for you do you think it's got

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:43.780 
enough for you do you think it's got
five<00:03:42.440> doors<00:03:42.709> it's<00:03:42.889> got<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> reasonable<00:03:43.430> boot<00:03:43.609> on

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
five doors it's got a reasonable boot on

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.550 
five doors it's got a reasonable boot on
it<00:03:43.909> yeah<00:03:44.479> I<00:03:44.690> would<00:03:44.930> say<00:03:44.959> it's<00:03:45.290> big<00:03:45.409> enough

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
it yeah I would say it's big enough

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.280 
it yeah I would say it's big enough
actually<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.099> doesn't<00:03:46.389> from<00:03:47.389> the<00:03:47.510> outside<00:03:47.900> it

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
actually it doesn't from the outside it

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.050 
actually it doesn't from the outside it
doesn't<00:03:48.500> actually<00:03:48.680> look<00:03:49.040> as<00:03:49.400> big<00:03:49.699> as<00:03:49.819> what<00:03:49.970> it

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
doesn't actually look as big as what it

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.969 
doesn't actually look as big as what it
has<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.329> feels<00:03:50.569> inside<00:03:51.049> which<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.709> nice

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
has to feels inside which is a nice

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.589 
has to feels inside which is a nice
surprise<00:03:52.190> there<00:03:52.729> is<00:03:52.849> plenty<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.209> room<00:03:53.389> in

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
surprise there is plenty of room in

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.050 
surprise there is plenty of room in
there<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.139> mean<00:03:54.769> perhaps<00:03:54.979> downsides<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:55.909> this

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
there I mean perhaps downsides to this

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.429 
there I mean perhaps downsides to this
car<00:03:56.239> it's<00:03:56.389> not<00:03:56.510> got<00:03:56.659> air<00:03:56.780> conditioning<00:03:57.319> or

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
car it's not got air conditioning or

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.050 
car it's not got air conditioning or
climbing

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
climbing

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.360 
climbing
on<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:59.080> you<00:03:59.410> could<00:03:59.560> always<00:03:59.709> find<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.190> car

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
on it but you could always find a car

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.010 
on it but you could always find a car
like<00:04:00.580> this<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:01.060> has<00:04:01.239> got<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.630> few<00:04:01.870> extra

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.610 
goodies on and the great thing with the
a3<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.569> do<00:04:04.630> start<00:04:05.020> cheap<00:04:05.349> now<00:04:05.530> I

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
a3 is that they do start cheap now I

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.170 
a3 is that they do start cheap now I
mean<00:04:05.770> some<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:05.980> them<00:04:06.099> are<00:04:06.280> as<00:04:06.580> low<00:04:06.730> as<00:04:06.760> six<00:04:07.060> and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
mean some of them are as low as six and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.699 
mean some of them are as low as six and
a<00:04:07.209> half<00:04:07.270> thousand<00:04:07.840> pounds<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.319> one<00:04:08.530> is

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
a half thousand pounds and this one is

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.559 
a half thousand pounds and this one is
well<00:04:09.430> within<00:04:09.580> your<00:04:09.700> budget<00:04:09.849> you've<00:04:10.390> set

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
well within your budget you've set

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.940 
well within your budget you've set
yourself<00:04:10.840> about<00:04:11.050> twelve<00:04:11.349> thousand<00:04:11.739> pounds

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
yourself about twelve thousand pounds

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.589 
yourself about twelve thousand pounds
and<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.790> would<00:04:13.000> cost<00:04:13.180> somewhere<00:04:13.540> around

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
and this would cost somewhere around

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.289 
and this would cost somewhere around
about<00:04:13.840> 11<00:04:14.170> or<00:04:14.200> 11<00:04:14.530> 1/2<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.130> it's<00:04:15.790> within<00:04:16.030> your

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
about 11 or 11 1/2 so it's within your

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:16.800 
about 11 or 11 1/2 so it's within your
budget

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
budget

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.229 
budget
that's<00:04:17.500> nice<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.919> know<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.579> I<00:04:18.790> think<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:19.120> is<00:04:19.150> a

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
that's nice to know is I think it is a

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.420 
that's nice to know is I think it is a
lot<00:04:19.419> of<00:04:19.450> money<00:04:19.660> it's<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.079> lot<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.410> car<00:04:20.650> for<00:04:20.950> not

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
lot of money it's a lot of car for not

00:04:21.430 --> 00:05:07.959 
lot of money it's a lot of car for not
alive
