00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
he neatly cuts every piece out so we get

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
he neatly cuts every piece out so we get
the<00:01:09.720> stencil<00:01:09.960> exactly<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.280> now

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
