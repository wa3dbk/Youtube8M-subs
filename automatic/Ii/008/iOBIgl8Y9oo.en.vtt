00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
no i also have pure essence there now

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960 
no i also have pure essence there now
one<00:01:46.500> thing<00:01:46.530> i'm<00:01:46.740> thinking<00:01:46.770> about<00:01:47.490> doing<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
one thing i'm thinking about doing is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.800 
one thing i'm thinking about doing is
just<00:01:48.000> having<00:01:48.390> runners<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.759> runecrafting

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
just having runners for runecrafting

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
just having runners for runecrafting
because<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.530> lazy<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> bit

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
because like I'm lazy and it's a bit

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.160 
because like I'm lazy and it's a bit
faster<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.420> guess<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> help<00:01:54.960> other

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
faster and I guess I can help other

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
faster and I guess I can help other
people<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.619> money<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:55.920> 60<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> 70

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
people out with money but 60 to 70

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.609 
people out with money but 60 to 70
runecrafting<00:01:57.030> maybe<00:01:57.420> those<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.750> runners<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
runecrafting maybe those do runners I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
runecrafting maybe those do runners I
don't<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.799> probably<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.810> people

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
