00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
hey guys it's Lily so I get this

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.919 
hey guys it's Lily so I get this
question<00:00:01.650> all<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.460> time<00:00:02.669> how<00:00:03.179> do<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.570> connect

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
question all the time how do you connect

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.840 
question all the time how do you connect
with<00:00:04.020> God<00:00:04.319> so<00:00:04.830> I'd<00:00:04.980> say<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.250> just<00:00:05.520> like<00:00:05.549> any

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
with God so I'd say that just like any

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.700 
with God so I'd say that just like any
relationship<00:00:06.210> it's<00:00:06.960> not<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.500> just

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
relationship it's not going to just

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.250 
relationship it's not going to just
immediately<00:00:08.370> happen<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.240> think<00:00:09.330> when<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.080> meet

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
immediately happen I think when you meet

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.749 
immediately happen I think when you meet
someone<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.800> first<00:00:10.830> time<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.610> little

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
someone for the first time it's a little

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.580 
someone for the first time it's a little
awkward<00:00:12.059> at<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:13.080> then<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.290> get<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
awkward at first and then you get to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.660 
awkward at first and then you get to
know<00:00:13.769> them<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.160> then<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.549> more

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
know them and then you get more

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
know them and then you get more
comfortable<00:00:14.880> around<00:00:15.299> them<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> think<00:00:15.990> it's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
comfortable around them so I think it's

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.450 
comfortable around them so I think it's
the<00:00:16.260> same<00:00:16.440> with<00:00:16.590> God<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:17.010> we're<00:00:17.190> meeting

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the same with God because we're meeting

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.320 
the same with God because we're meeting
God's<00:00:17.670> image

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
God's image

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
God's image
so<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> stereotypical<00:00:18.930> read<00:00:19.410> your<00:00:19.560> Bible<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
so the stereotypical read your Bible and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740 
so the stereotypical read your Bible and
pray<00:00:20.160> thing<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> totally<00:00:20.820> true<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.570> read

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
pray thing is totally true if you read

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.269 
pray thing is totally true if you read
your<00:00:21.900> Bible<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.260> pray<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:22.949> connect

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
your Bible and pray you will connect

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
your Bible and pray you will connect
with<00:00:23.430> God<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> problem<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.840> that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
with God but I think the problem is that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.359 
with God but I think the problem is that
a<00:00:25.019> lot<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.289> people<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.740> those<00:00:25.920> things<00:00:26.220> just

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
a lot of people do those things just

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.710 
a lot of people do those things just
because<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.760> feel<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
because they feel like they have to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
because they feel like they have to
rather<00:00:27.990> than<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.529> want<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.490> think

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
rather than they want to and I think

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
rather than they want to and I think
that<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:29.880> first<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.480> may<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.050> fake<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that at first you may have to fake it to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.700 
that at first you may have to fake it to
get<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:33.000> lot<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.210> people<00:00:33.480> say<00:00:33.600> that

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
get there and a lot of people say that

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
get there and a lot of people say that
Christianity<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.130> about<00:00:35.219> freedom<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
Christianity is about freedom you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
Christianity is about freedom you
shouldn't<00:00:36.600> force<00:00:36.960> yourself<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.950> creed

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
shouldn't force yourself to the creed

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
shouldn't force yourself to the creed
your<00:00:38.370> Bible<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.820> don't<00:00:39.030> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
your Bible if you don't want to but I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.139 
your Bible if you don't want to but I
kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> compare<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.030> was

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
kind of compare that to when I was

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.369 
kind of compare that to when I was
little<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> didn't<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:42.930> brushing<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.290> teeth

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
little I didn't like brushing my teeth

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
little I didn't like brushing my teeth
like<00:00:43.800> kindergarten<00:00:44.250> status<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
like kindergarten status and so I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.790 
like kindergarten status and so I
wouldn't<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:46.469> when<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.620> did

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
wouldn't want to but then when I did

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
wouldn't want to but then when I did
brush<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.190> teeth<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.640> wow<00:00:47.940> my<00:00:48.390> teeth

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
brush my teeth it's like wow my teeth

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.779 
brush my teeth it's like wow my teeth
feel<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.050> fresh<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.440> minty<00:00:49.770> yeah<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
feel all fresh and minty yeah and I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
feel all fresh and minty yeah and I
think<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> same<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:52.050> connecting<00:00:52.770> with

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
think it's the same with connecting with

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.830 
think it's the same with connecting with
God<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.250> reading<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.640> Bible<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.360> first<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
God and reading your Bible at first you

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.330 
God and reading your Bible at first you
might<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.230> oh<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> open<00:00:56.250> my

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
might be like oh I don't want to open my

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
might be like oh I don't want to open my
Bible<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.850> once<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Bible but once you do you're going to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.510 
Bible but once you do you're going to
feel<00:00:58.230> refreshed<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
feel refreshed and it's going to be a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.020 
feel refreshed and it's going to be a
great<00:00:59.820> thing<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> well<00:01:01.489> have<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> pen<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.940> me

or a highlighter whenever I'm reading it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.289 
or a highlighter whenever I'm reading it
people<00:01:04.799> who<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.369> Bible<00:01:05.670> usually<00:01:06.119> think

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
people who see my Bible usually think

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.270 
people who see my Bible usually think
it's<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> crazy<00:01:06.840> how<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.320> annotate<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's kind of crazy how I annotate it I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.429 
it's kind of crazy how I annotate it I
underline<00:01:09.180> things<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.990> write<00:01:10.200> what

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
underline things and then I write what

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
underline things and then I write what
I'm<00:01:10.560> thinking<00:01:10.979> next<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I'm thinking next to it and then if it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
I'm thinking next to it and then if it
reminds<00:01:12.900> me<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> another<00:01:13.229> Bible<00:01:13.619> verse<00:01:13.890> that's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
reminds me of another Bible verse that's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740 
reminds me of another Bible verse that's
similar<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> Bible<00:01:15.479> verse

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750

living<00:04:06.950> book<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.459> something<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:07.850> can<00:04:08.030> do

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
so I think we should feel some sort of

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.560 
so I think we should feel some sort of
emotion<00:04:12.800> in<00:04:13.070> our<00:04:13.160> relationship<00:04:13.640> with<00:04:13.700> God<00:04:13.760> but

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
emotion in our relationship with God but

emotion in our relationship with God but
our<00:04:14.720> decision<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.200> be<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.350> Christian<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:15.920> not

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
our decision to be a Christian is not

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.400 
our decision to be a Christian is not
based<00:04:16.700> on<00:04:16.910> emotion<00:04:17.480> for<00:04:17.840> me<00:04:17.989> it's<00:04:18.230> all<00:04:18.380> about

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
based on emotion for me it's all about

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.050 
based on emotion for me it's all about
what<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.070> best<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.340> my<00:04:19.430> knowledge<00:04:19.459> is
