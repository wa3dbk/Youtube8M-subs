you notice in this system there are no
docking<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> tails<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.870> no

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
docking of the tails and there's no

docking of the tails and there's no
clipping<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.500> teeth<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.370> those<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
clipping with teeth so those are some of

clipping with teeth so those are some of
the<00:00:36.149> main<00:00:36.300> differences<00:00:38.719> tell<00:00:39.719> me<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the main differences tell me about the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
the main differences tell me about the
feed<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:41.399> feed<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> vegetarian<00:00:43.309> no<00:00:44.309> animal

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
feed this feed is a vegetarian no animal

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.240 
feed this feed is a vegetarian no animal
by-products<00:00:45.360> right<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> no<00:00:46.980> growth

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
by-products right and no growth

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.119 
by-products right and no growth
promoters<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:48.270> nothing<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
promoters not nothing at all so that's a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
promoters not nothing at all so that's a
big<00:00:50.370> difference<00:00:50.550> between<00:00:50.879> conventional<00:00:51.239> feed

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
big difference between conventional feed

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.600 
big difference between conventional feed
in<00:00:51.960> our

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.030 

tell<00:00:55.270> me<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.420> little<00:00:55.510> bit<00:00:55.630> about<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.500> flooring

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
tell me a little bit about the flooring

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.190 
tell me a little bit about the flooring
in<00:00:57.190> here<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.790> bedding<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.540> square<00:00:58.840> footage

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
in here the bedding the square footage

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.370 
in here the bedding the square footage
that's<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.650> pigs<00:00:59.890> gap<00:01:00.480> flooring<00:01:01.480> here<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.320> a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
that's the pigs gap flooring here is a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.910 
that's the pigs gap flooring here is a
solid<00:01:02.950> floor<00:01:03.900> that<00:01:04.900> enables<00:01:05.410> us<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.620> put

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
solid floor that enables us to put

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.340 
solid floor that enables us to put
bedding<00:01:06.370> down<00:01:06.550> such<00:01:07.240> as<00:01:07.390> straw<00:01:07.660> could<00:01:08.230> be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
bedding down such as straw could be

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.850 
bedding down such as straw could be
shavings<00:01:08.830> could<00:01:09.580> be<00:01:09.730> corn<00:01:10.000> stover<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
shavings could be corn stover and you

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.410 
shavings could be corn stover and you
notice<00:01:12.160> too<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.340> there's<00:01:12.760> a<00:01:13.030> lot<00:01:13.270> more

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
notice too that there's a lot more

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.390 
notice too that there's a lot more
square<00:01:13.630> footage<00:01:13.870> so<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.830> lot<00:01:15.040> more<00:01:15.220> square

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
square footage so a lot more square

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.540 
square footage so a lot more square
footage<00:01:15.670> means<00:01:16.660> that<00:01:16.960> there's<00:01:17.260> a<00:01:17.410> health<00:01:18.340> care

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
footage means that there's a health care

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.990 
footage means that there's a health care

stage two
here's<00:01:33.640> stage<00:01:33.970> three<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.900> give<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.080> good<00:01:35.350> air

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
here's stage three you give a good air

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.810 
here's stage three you give a good air
give<00:01:36.490> lots<00:01:36.790> of<00:01:36.970> space<00:01:37.240> lots<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:38.410> water<00:01:38.820> it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
give lots of space lots of water it's

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.450 
give lots of space lots of water it's
pretty<00:01:40.060> clear<00:01:40.300> sailing<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.979> great<00:01:41.979> humane
