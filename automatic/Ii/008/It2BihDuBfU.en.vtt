00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.140 

painting<00:00:17.670> only<00:00:18.120> with<00:00:18.270> primary<00:00:18.780> colors<00:00:20.150> these

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
painting only with primary colors these

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.660 
painting only with primary colors these
three<00:00:21.480> ways<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.110> paint<00:00:22.380> using<00:00:23.010> only

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
three ways we can paint using only

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.570 
three ways we can paint using only
primary<00:00:23.970> colors<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.500> first<00:00:25.770> way<00:00:26.040> is<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.550> can

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
primary colors the first way is we can

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.000 
primary colors the first way is we can
use<00:00:26.970> only<00:00:27.630> our<00:00:27.720> three<00:00:27.930> primary<00:00:28.170> colors<00:00:28.680> plus

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
use only our three primary colors plus

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.299 
use only our three primary colors plus
white<00:00:29.040> and<00:00:29.869> use<00:00:30.869> though<00:00:31.200> they're<00:00:31.950> in<00:00:32.160> our

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
white and use though they're in our

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.640 
white and use though they're in our
color<00:00:32.550> wheel<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.270> mix<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> other<00:00:34.200> colors

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
color wheel to mix all the other colors

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.119 
color wheel to mix all the other colors
we<00:00:34.830> need<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.220> our<00:00:35.370> scene<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> second<00:00:37.559> way<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we need in our scene the second way is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.240 
we need in our scene the second way is
to<00:00:38.280> use<00:00:38.670> only<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.390> primary<00:00:39.780> colors<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> makes

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to use only the primary colors and makes

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.170 
to use only the primary colors and makes
them<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.750> possible<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:44.790> canvas

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
them as little as possible on the canvas

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
them as little as possible on the canvas
so<00:00:45.330> what<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:45.780> happen<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.320> you'll<00:00:46.650> get<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
so what would happen is you'll get a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.030 
so what would happen is you'll get a
very<00:00:47.250> bright<00:00:47.879> intense<00:00:48.659> pure<00:00:49.170> primary<00:00:49.800> color

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040

it's<00:01:08.760> called<00:01:09.090> la<00:01:09.390> pariah<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.799> painted

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
it's called la pariah and it was painted

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's called la pariah and it was painted
in<00:01:11.250> 1889<00:01:12.860> what<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.570> painting

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
in 1889 what if that is you painting

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.240 
in 1889 what if that is you painting
small<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.620> dabs<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.159> pure<00:01:17.729> primary<00:01:18.360> colors

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
small little dabs of pure primary colors

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.929 
small little dabs of pure primary colors
the<00:01:20.250> idea<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.509> when<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.990> stand<00:01:22.350> back

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
the idea is that when you stand back

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.080 
the idea is that when you stand back
those<00:01:23.939> colors<00:01:24.450> optically<00:01:25.409> mix<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.039> show<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
those colors optically mix and show you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
those colors optically mix and show you
the<00:01:27.420> color<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.990> artist<00:01:30.990> intended<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the color that the artist intended you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.539 
the color that the artist intended you
to<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.420> for<00:01:33.420> example<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.469> you<00:01:34.680> wanted<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.130> area

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to see for example if you wanted an area

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.389 
to see for example if you wanted an area
of<00:01:35.640> green<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.750> paint<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.259> area<00:01:37.530> we're

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
of green you will paint that area we're

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.849 
of green you will paint that area we're
using<00:01:38.609> small<00:01:39.180> dabs<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.689> yellow<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.350> small

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
using small dabs of yellow and small

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.039
