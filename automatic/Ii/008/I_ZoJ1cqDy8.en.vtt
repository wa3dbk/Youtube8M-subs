definitely a fire hey hey hey hey
another<00:02:38.920> screamer<00:02:39.459> fire<00:02:43.829> that's<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.980> beautiful

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489

fire

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.059 

I<00:02:51.879> think<00:02:52.629> I<00:02:52.870> think<00:02:53.319> there<00:02:53.469> was<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> point<00:02:53.890> when

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
I think I think there was a point when

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.220 
I think I think there was a point when
we're<00:02:54.219> reading<00:02:54.999> the<00:02:55.060> spider<00:02:55.390> fire<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.109> this

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
we're reading the spider fire to this

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.229 
we're reading the spider fire to this
too<00:02:56.499> early<00:02:56.799> early<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.519> game<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.969> I<00:02:58.030> think

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
too early early in the game and I think

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.979 
too early early in the game and I think
he<00:02:58.389> may<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.629> been<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.129> who's<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.310> daddy<00:03:00.989> may

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
he may have been the who's the daddy may

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.690 
he may have been the who's the daddy may
have<00:03:02.109> won<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.439> who<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.650> daddy<00:03:03.010> contests

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
have won that who the daddy contests

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.819 
have won that who the daddy contests
even<00:03:04.450> though<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.689> primarily<00:03:04.959> brought<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.769> a

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
even though we primarily brought it to a

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.820 
even though we primarily brought it to a
spider

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.050
