website when it's built on the Microsoft

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.410 
website when it's built on the Microsoft
stack<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:11.280> have<00:00:11.309> many<00:00:11.580> choices<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:12.150> how<00:00:12.360> you

stack you have many choices on how you
can<00:00:12.719> host<00:00:12.870> your<00:00:13.080> site<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.309> go<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
can host your site you can go to a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.750 
can host your site you can go to a
commercial<00:00:15.420> hoster<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.529> by<00:00:17.039> hosting

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
commercial hoster and just by hosting

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.160 
commercial hoster and just by hosting
they'll<00:00:17.940> set<00:00:18.180> everything<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
they'll set everything up for you and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.080 
they'll set everything up for you and
typically<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.949> publish<00:00:20.310> through<00:00:20.520> FTP<00:00:21.060> or

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
typically you publish through FTP or

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.359 
typically you publish through FTP or
something<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.840> that's<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
something like that that's one way a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.880 
something like that that's one way a
more<00:00:23.730> common<00:00:24.210> way<00:00:24.240> maybe<00:00:25.050> would<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.650> host

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
more common way maybe would be to host

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.070 
more common way maybe would be to host
it<00:00:26.070> yourself<00:00:26.130> within<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.789> own<00:00:27.029> data<00:00:27.720> center

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it yourself within your own data center

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.480 
it yourself within your own data center
maybe<00:00:28.320> you're<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> large<00:00:28.890> corporates

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
maybe you're a large corporates

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
maybe you're a large corporates
corporation<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> run<00:00:30.539> your<00:00:30.720> own<00:00:30.810> servers<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
corporation you run your own servers you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.620 
corporation you run your own servers you
can<00:00:31.349> host<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> there<00:00:32.009> another<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.450> popular

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
can host it there another really popular

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
can host it there another really popular
and<00:00:34.140> growing<00:00:34.620> trend<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> host<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.760> site

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and growing trend is to host your site

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.229 
and growing trend is to host your site
in<00:00:36.270> Microsoft<00:00:37.260> Azure<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.950> we'll<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
in Microsoft Azure and we'll see how to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
in Microsoft Azure and we'll see how to
do<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> later<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.320> particular<00:00:40.710> video

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
do that later in this particular video

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.500 
do that later in this particular video
we're<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> talk<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:41.879> how<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> set

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
we're going to talk about how do you set

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.860 
we're going to talk about how do you set
up<00:00:42.719> your<00:00:42.960> own<00:00:42.989> hosting<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:43.980> own<00:00:44.160> servers

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
up your own hosting on your own servers

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
up your own hosting on your own servers
so<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:46.230> steps<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> host

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
so there's two steps we're going to host

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.229 
so there's two steps we're going to host
our<00:00:48.230> website<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.920> let's<00:00:50.670> check<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> few

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
our website in is let's check out a few

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.540 
our website in is let's check out a few
things<00:00:51.360> before<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.170> get<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
things before we actually get there so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
things before we actually get there so
you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.270> run<00:00:54.690> our<00:00:54.870> website

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you can see that we can run our website

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
you can see that we can run our website
and<00:00:55.440> here's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.649> cheesy<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.789> wacky<00:00:57.149> web

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and here's a cheesy little wacky web

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.740 
and here's a cheesy little wacky web
world<00:00:57.750> website<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.180> you'll<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.539> can

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
world website and you'll see that we can

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
world website and you'll see that we can
host<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:02.280> seems<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.670> running<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
host it here it seems to be running in a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.759 
host it here it seems to be running in a
server<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:04.049> true<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
server and that's true in the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.320 
server and that's true in the
development<00:01:05.220> mode<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
development mode so if we go down here

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.560 
development mode so if we go down here
you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:08.310> Express<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.360> is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you can see this is is Express this is

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.039 
you can see this is is Express this is
fine<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.110> development<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> won't<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.369> for

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
fine for development but it won't do for

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
fine for development but it won't do for
production<00:01:13.049> hosting<00:01:13.470> okay<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.310> doesn't

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
need this is for testing and development

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
need this is for testing and development
it's<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> production<00:01:18.869> web<00:01:19.170> server<00:01:19.470> what

is management console so you can

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.950 
is management console so you can
actually<00:01:49.979> work<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.579> thing<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
actually work with the thing now if you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually work with the thing now if you
do<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.470> Windows<00:01:52.860> server<00:01:53.240> typically<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
do this on Windows server typically you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.510 
do this on Windows server typically you
do<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.810> slightly<00:01:55.200> different<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> install

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
do a slightly different way to install

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
do a slightly different way to install
this<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.149> add<00:01:57.240> roles<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.170> server

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
this you go and add roles to your server

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.590 
this you go and add roles to your server
so<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> need<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> add<00:01:59.490> two<00:01:59.820> roles<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.360> need<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so you need to add two roles you need to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
so you need to add two roles you need to
add<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.020> application<00:02:01.740> server<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.759> web

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
add the application server and the web

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.109 
add the application server and the web
server<00:02:03.329> for<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.920> either<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:05.969> get

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
server for is so either way you get

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.789 
server for is so either way you get
installed<00:02:06.540> once<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.290> you'll<00:02:07.649> be

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
installed once you have it up you'll be

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.949 
installed once you have it up you'll be
able<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.129> run<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.479> come<00:02:09.629> over<00:02:09.690> here<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
able to run is so we come over here and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.180 
able to run is so we come over here and
just<00:02:10.050> type<00:02:10.289> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
just type is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.950 
just type is
for<00:02:11.310> Internet<00:02:11.670> information<00:02:12.240> service<00:02:12.570> manager

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
for Internet information service manager

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.210 
for Internet information service manager
and<00:02:13.550> open<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:16.020> imagine<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and open this up so imagine this is a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.280 
and open this up so imagine this is a
remote<00:02:17.580> machine<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.270> could<00:02:18.390> Remote<00:02:18.780> Desktop<00:02:18.810> 2

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
remote machine we could Remote Desktop 2

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.450 
remote machine we could Remote Desktop 2
or<00:02:19.410> something<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.980> we'd<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
or something like that we'd like to

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.100 
or something like that we'd like to

something<00:02:44.910> like<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.210> let<00:02:45.390> me<00:02:45.450> copy<00:02:45.720> that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
something like that let me copy that

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.910 
something like that let me copy that
we'll<00:02:46.080> need<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.380> few<00:02:46.530> places

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
we'll need in a few places

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.280 
we'll need in a few places
then<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.940> need<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.120> pick<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.570> application

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
then we need to pick the application

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.600 
then we need to pick the application
pool<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.710> can<00:02:49.740> see<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> create

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
pool you can see it's going to create

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610 
pool you can see it's going to create
one<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.090> basically<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.660> process<00:02:51.960> that

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
one this is basically the process that

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.290 
one this is basically the process that
your<00:02:52.770> site<00:02:53.010> runs<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.910> over<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.240> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
your site runs in and over here in the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.970 
your site runs in and over here in the
physical<00:02:54.660> path<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.410> put<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.650> somewhere<00:02:55.860> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
physical path we can put it somewhere I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.680 
physical path we can put it somewhere I
typically<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.700> put<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
typically like to put this on to a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.540 
typically like to put this on to a
second<00:02:58.620> drive<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.830> wouldn't<00:02:59.130> really<00:02:59.280> choose

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
second drive I wouldn't really choose

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.300 
second drive I wouldn't really choose
the<00:02:59.930> CD<00:03:00.930> drive<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.380> maybe<00:03:01.500> drive<00:03:01.770> D<00:03:02.010> we'll

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
the CD drive and maybe drive D we'll

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.940 
the CD drive and maybe drive D we'll
call<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.730> WWE<00:03:03.240> over<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.290> within<00:03:04.500> there

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
call this WWE over here and within there

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.970 
call this WWE over here and within there
I'd<00:03:05.190> probably<00:03:05.910> create<00:03:06.500> something<00:03:07.500> along<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
I'd probably create something along the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.380 
I'd probably create something along the
name<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.550> site<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> might<00:03:09.300> have

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
name of the site because you might have

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.420 
name of the site because you might have
many<00:03:09.690> sites<00:03:10.020> hosted<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.710> your<00:03:10.830> server<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.190> is

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
many sites hosted on your server this is

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.980 
many sites hosted on your server this is
easy<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.850> do<00:03:12.000> as<00:03:12.210> you'll<00:03:12.420> see<00:03:12.630> in<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
easy to do as you'll see in just a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.490 
easy to do as you'll see in just a
second<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:15.000> what<00:03:15.780> you'll<00:03:15.930> do<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.140> you'll<00:03:16.380> go

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
second so what you'll do is you'll go

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.330 
second so what you'll do is you'll go
map<00:03:16.800> from<00:03:17.280> your<00:03:17.910> domain<00:03:18.510> your<00:03:19.010> domain<00:03:20.010> host

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
map from your domain your domain host

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.430 
map from your domain your domain host
people<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.480> control<00:03:21.780> your<00:03:21.959> domain<00:03:22.260> name

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
people that control your domain name

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.320 
people that control your domain name
you'll<00:03:22.650> go<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.100> your<00:03:23.220> DNS<00:03:23.730> settings<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.180> map

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
you'll go to your DNS settings and map

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.120 
you'll go to your DNS settings and map
them<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.959> server<00:03:25.260> whatever<00:03:25.830> its<00:03:25.980> IP

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
them to this server whatever its IP

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.520 
them to this server whatever its IP
address<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.570> server<00:03:27.930> will<00:03:27.959> see

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
address is and then the server will see

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.180 
address is and then the server will see
the<00:03:28.680> inbound<00:03:29.660> request<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.959> URL<00:03:31.200> for<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
the inbound request in the URL for a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.740 
the inbound request in the URL for a
particular<00:03:32.580> host<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.600> will

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
particular host and it will

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.080 
particular host and it will
differentiate<00:03:34.470> between<00:03:34.830> different<00:03:35.400> server

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
differentiate between different server

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.990 
differentiate between different server
different<00:03:36.870> websites<00:03:37.770> using<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:38.880> we'll

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
different websites using that so we'll

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.620 
different websites using that so we'll
just<00:03:39.150> put<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.390> here<00:03:40.640> alright<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:41.850> now<00:03:42.300> we<00:03:42.420> can

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
just put this here alright so now we can

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.890 
just put this here alright so now we can
come<00:03:42.750> over<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.440> talk<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.370> our<00:03:44.550> site<00:03:44.900> I've

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
come over here and talk to our site I've

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.780 
come over here and talk to our site I've
already<00:03:46.230> mapped<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.650> domain<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.430> local

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
already mapped that domain to this local

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.520 
already mapped that domain to this local
machine<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.570> go<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.810> wacky<00:03:49.200> web

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
machine so I can go to wacky web

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.460

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
the file system all right so maybe this

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.560 
the file system all right so maybe this
is<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.830> network<00:04:33.400> share<00:04:33.580> or<00:04:33.730> something<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:34.180> our

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
is a network share or something in our

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.520 
is a network share or something in our
world<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.380> put<00:04:35.650> this<00:04:35.800> over<00:04:36.010> here<00:04:36.310> on<00:04:36.460> D<00:04:37.350> wway<00:04:38.350> key

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.160 
world I put this over here on D wway key
web<00:04:38.680> world<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.100> we'll<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.340> put<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.580> there<00:04:40.170> say

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
web world so we'll just put it there say

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.260 
web world so we'll just put it there say
next<00:04:41.410> we<00:04:42.160> want<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.370> publish<00:04:42.550> release<00:04:43.030> you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
next we want to publish release you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.920 
next we want to publish release you
typically<00:04:43.690> don't<00:04:43.780> want<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.990> publish<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:45.930> debug

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
typically don't want to publish a debug

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.690 
typically don't want to publish a debug
build<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.410> we<00:04:47.500> could<00:04:47.620> say<00:04:47.800> clean<00:04:48.340> out<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
build and we could say clean out that

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.380 
build and we could say clean out that
area<00:04:49.000> if<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.540> wish<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:50.700> if<00:04:51.700> we<00:04:52.060> remove<00:04:52.240> a

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
area if you wish so that if we remove a

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.970 
area if you wish so that if we remove a
file<00:04:52.660> it's<00:04:52.840> also<00:04:52.990> later<00:04:53.410> removed<00:04:53.770> from<00:04:53.800> the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
file it's also later removed from the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.010 
file it's also later removed from the
server<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:55.090> now<00:04:55.540> we<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.750> just<00:04:55.960> hit

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.540 
server and so now we can just hit
publish<00:04:56.230> you'll<00:04:56.710> see<00:04:56.890> down<00:04:57.040> here<00:04:57.100> it's<00:04:57.400> going

up<00:05:35.290> on<00:05:35.410> the<00:05:35.470> server<00:05:35.770> it's<00:05:35.890> super<00:05:36.160> easy<00:05:36.280> to<00:05:36.460> do

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
up on the server it's super easy to do

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.740 
up on the server it's super easy to do
but<00:05:36.970> it's<00:05:37.090> something<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.390> have<00:05:37.480> to<00:05:37.540> download

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
but it's something you have to download

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.500 
but it's something you have to download
and<00:05:38.110> install<00:05:38.140> don't<00:05:39.130> have<00:05:39.280> that<00:05:39.430> setup<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.910> do

and install don't have that setup and do
it<00:05:40.630> locally<00:05:40.750> it's<00:05:41.260> kind<00:05:41.500> of<00:05:41.560> silly<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.890> show

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
it locally it's kind of silly to show

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.430 
it locally it's kind of silly to show
you<00:05:42.100> that<00:05:42.280> way<00:05:42.420> in<00:05:43.420> another<00:05:43.690> video<00:05:44.080> when<00:05:44.350> we

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
you that way in another video when we

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.300 
you that way in another video when we
talk<00:05:44.620> about<00:05:44.650> asier

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310

talk about asier
I'll<00:05:45.580> show<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.120> how<00:05:46.420> to<00:05:46.480> use<00:05:46.690> web<00:05:46.900> deploy<00:05:47.170> to

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
I'll show you how to use web deploy to

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.010 
I'll show you how to use web deploy to
publish<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.830> Azure<00:05:48.540> alright<00:05:49.540> so<00:05:49.720> that's<00:05:49.900> how

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
publish to Azure alright so that's how

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.110 
publish to Azure alright so that's how
you<00:05:50.110> set<00:05:50.350> up<00:05:50.380> is<00:05:50.890> take<00:05:51.400> your<00:05:51.550> website<00:05:51.940> and

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
you set up is take your website and

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.790 
you set up is take your website and
publish<00:05:52.480> to<00:05:52.600> it<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:53.020> can<00:05:53.140> either<00:05:53.320> just<00:05:53.470> copy

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
publish to it you can either just copy

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.220 
publish to it you can either just copy
the<00:05:54.010> files<00:05:54.220> sometimes<00:05:54.730> that's<00:05:55.150> FTP<00:05:55.600> really

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
the files sometimes that's FTP really

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.630 
the files sometimes that's FTP really
the<00:05:56.350> best<00:05:56.500> way<00:05:56.710> is<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.890> use<00:05:57.100> web<00:05:57.340> deploy

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
the best way is to use web deploy

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.210 
the best way is to use web deploy
because<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:58.060> kind<00:05:58.510> of<00:05:58.600> does<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:58.990> web<00:05:59.710> config

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
because it kind of does the web config

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.160 
because it kind of does the web config
compilation<00:06:00.940> transformations<00:06:01.690> and<00:06:01.870> all<00:06:01.990> that

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
compilation transformations and all that

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.450 
compilation transformations and all that
kind<00:06:02.350> of<00:06:02.380> stuff<00:06:02.470> that<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.800> need<00:06:02.980> done<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.370> it

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
kind of stuff that you need done and it

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.340 
kind of stuff that you need done and it
drops<00:06:03.700> it<00:06:03.850> right<00:06:04.030> where<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.270> needs<00:06:04.390> to<00:06:04.450> be<00:06:04.510> you

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
drops it right where it needs to be you

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.440 
drops it right where it needs to be you
can<00:06:05.500> even<00:06:05.650> tell<00:06:05.920> it<00:06:06.040> after<00:06:06.370> it's<00:06:06.610> done<00:06:06.760> going

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
can even tell it after it's done going

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.870 
can even tell it after it's done going
to<00:06:07.840> open<00:06:08.140> up<00:06:08.260> a<00:06:08.350> particular<00:06:08.440> page<00:06:08.950> like<00:06:09.760> this
