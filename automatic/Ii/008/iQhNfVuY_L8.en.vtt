smoked<00:00:54.660> oysters<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.129> picked<00:00:56.370> up

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
smoked oysters which I picked up

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.430 
smoked oysters which I picked up
inexpensively<00:00:57.059> oysters<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.840> very<00:00:57.989> good<00:00:58.230> in

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
inexpensively oysters are very good in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.220 
inexpensively oysters are very good in
terms<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.520> trace<00:00:59.879> minerals<00:01:00.239> which<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> need

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
terms of trace minerals which I need

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.470 
terms of trace minerals which I need
apparently<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.789> tests<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.329> my

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
apparently from my tests with my

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.420 
apparently from my tests with my
naturopath<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.799> having

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
naturopath so that's what I'm having

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460 
naturopath so that's what I'm having
them<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.810> now<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:06.990> people<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
them for now some people like the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
them for now some people like the
risotto<00:01:07.770> thinner<00:01:08.130> more<00:01:08.700> runny<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.810> more

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
risotto thinner more runny I think more

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480 
risotto thinner more runny I think more
traditionally<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> should<00:01:10.799> run<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.100> should

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
traditionally it should run it should

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
traditionally it should run it should
almost<00:01:11.610> poor<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.229> could

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
almost poor so if you want you could

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
almost poor so if you want you could
always<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.740> add<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.490> broth

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
always just add a little bit more broth

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.649 
always just add a little bit more broth
but<00:01:16.850> that's<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> way<00:01:18.150> we're<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> have

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
but that's the way we're going to have

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.440 
but that's the way we're going to have
it<00:01:18.830> cover<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> keep<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> warm<00:01:20.700> alright

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
it cover that up to keep it warm alright

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.600 
it cover that up to keep it warm alright
our<00:01:21.600> sauce<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> basically<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.830> about<00:01:23.369> done
