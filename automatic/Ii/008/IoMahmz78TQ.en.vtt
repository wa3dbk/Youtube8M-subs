00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.980
 regular viewers of my channel it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.509

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.790
 and he lives in England today May 23, 2015 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.250
 years on a tank takes part in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.720
 competitions that take place in the city 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 vln gordon city 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.840
 Here and in every way I want to wish Nathan 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.800
 good luck for him to break all his records and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.099
 all my records, too, to beat here 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.160
 today to me from england over she came 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.140
 such a parcel congratulations on the day 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.670
 of birth 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 I am absolutely not worried about this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.190
 that a little bit she did not have time on May 8th but 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 still it is england distance unknown 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 how much did this package go and what kind of 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 the way she did it is also impressive 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.340
 but what is most impressive is that guy 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.920
 who lives in general can be said on 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 another end of the planet came to mind 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.609
 such an idea like this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.020
 wish me happy birthday this 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.280
 insanely nice i shot anka rob king 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.610
 this promise of this premise here and i noticed 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.640
 what in one box 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 By the way sent not by mail Russia 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 english mail which i'm sure 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.549
 much faster well and outwardly 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 also different box is not blue white 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.540
 when I opened the box in Russian opened 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.700
 English box so not very 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.380
 cultural withdraw entered I saw that in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 she had another pack 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.939
 well, everything is clean in English so wrapped 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600
 so nothing falls nothing 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.689
 spilled out 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.850
 thats just a logging there was another box 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.259
 here it is on this box so 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.600
 beautiful beautiful that it does not even know 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.970
 beautiful flower 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.939
 by the way this video ruslan shoots 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.560

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.770

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.430
 showed here that is in the box was 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.619
 box 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.349
 that box is still a box in that box 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.750
 another box but in that box already 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.680
 the envelope here is such a sweet wonder 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 postcard for which such here 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.410
 small letters very nicely written 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.610

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.110
 english tea 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.700
 once in my life I was already drinking this 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.980
 English tea and most probably 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.750

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.810

 Manchester at the airport it was tea with 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.700
 mint after this tea remained pleasant 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.890
 aftertaste well, after this tea I 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.019

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.230
 aftertaste because this tea is 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.200
 a gift still made with love also from 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.260

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.079
 years doing here wish you success in 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.540
 mastering new foreign languages ​​though 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.120
 you already know their huge 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.609
 amount and hebrew by the way it is written here 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.680
 little Hebrew 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.560
 on there for some time lived for several years 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.660
 in Israel , naturally, Nathan says 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.819
 in English and he speaks well 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.859
 in Russian this is what I wanted for so many 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.420
 foreign languages ​​talk but to 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:40.850
 Unfortunately , I recently have my friends here. 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.010
 thank you all for your attention and I forgot 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.889
 say why the process boxes on 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.019
 it was not filmed well, but a little carpenter 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:52.670
 I made a little mistake here she decided to shoot 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.639
 not what we wanted but what we want 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.620
 the camera itself that is when we have it 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.620
 turned on she did not take off and when 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.389
 turned off then already started 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.569
 not the first time reacted but nothing 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.880
 terrible but the whole process of disclosure 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.300
 these boxes are a long process 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.970
 didn't get to the video the most interesting 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.540
 left here on this note all thanks and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.540
 to new meetings
