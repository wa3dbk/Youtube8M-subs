00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
else I wanted to mention is the handles

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.540 
else I wanted to mention is the handles
obviously<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.440> handles<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:08.950> my<00:02:09.070> name<00:02:09.280> on

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
obviously the handles have my name on

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.610 
obviously the handles have my name on
them<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.780> course<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.200> number<00:02:11.500> that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
them and of course the number that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.610 
them and of course the number that
corresponds<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.400> them<00:02:12.670> now<00:02:13.150> heavy<00:02:13.750> usage<00:02:14.050> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
corresponds to them now heavy usage and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.110 
corresponds to them now heavy usage and
all<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.220> kind<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.520> thing<00:02:15.700> will

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
all of that kind of thing will

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.400 
all of that kind of thing will
eventually<00:02:16.660> wear<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.780> name<00:02:19.780> out<00:02:20.020> because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
eventually wear the name out because

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.170 
eventually wear the name out because
there's<00:02:20.650> nowhere<00:02:20.830> around<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.850> only<00:02:21.970> way

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
there's nowhere around that the only way

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.610 
there's nowhere around that the only way
around<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.630> for<00:02:22.810> me<00:02:22.930> was<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.440> them

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
around that for me was to get them

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.949 
around that for me was to get them
lasered<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.390> increased<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
lasered on but that would increased the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.380 
lasered on but that would increased the
cost<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.470> each<00:02:26.650> brush<00:02:27.190> by<00:02:27.550> nearly<00:02:28.120> three

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
cost of each brush by nearly three

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 
cost of each brush by nearly three
pounds<00:02:28.750> fifty<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:30.010> wasn't<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.490> option<00:02:30.610> for

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
pounds fifty so it wasn't an option for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.120 
pounds fifty so it wasn't an option for
me<00:02:31.030> they're<00:02:31.209> hot<00:02:31.420> stamped<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.620> they're

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
me they're hot stamped so they're

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.670 
me they're hot stamped so they're
durable<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:34.090> if<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.170> you're<00:02:35.440> really

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
durable but if you know you're really

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.590 
durable but if you know you're really
like<00:02:35.890> scratching<00:02:36.459> at<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.730> or<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.150> gets<00:02:37.480> an

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
like scratching at it or it just gets an

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.060 
like scratching at it or it just gets an
incredible<00:02:38.110> amount<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.350> use<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.709> start

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
incredible amount of use and you start

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.979 
incredible amount of use and you start
to<00:02:39.160> see<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.370> name<00:02:39.550> fake<00:02:39.820> don't<00:02:40.390> worry<00:02:40.600> it's

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
to see the name fake don't worry it's

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.229 
to see the name fake don't worry it's
hot<00:02:41.320> stamp<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.920> even<00:02:42.310> when<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.520> can't<00:02:42.790> see<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
hot stamp so even when you can't see it

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.240 
hot stamp so even when you can't see it
it's<00:02:43.750> still<00:02:44.050> on<00:02:44.200> there<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.680> still<00:02:45.010> read

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
it's still on there you can still read

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.820 
it's still on there you can still read
it<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.120> would<00:02:46.450> love<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.870> get<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.170> laser<00:02:47.380> but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
it but I would love to get the laser but

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.470 
it but I would love to get the laser but
I<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:48.160> really<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.910> would<00:02:49.239> have<00:02:49.330> just

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
I just really it would have just

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.449 
I just really it would have just
increased<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.020> cost<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.530> much<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.340> it

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
increased the cost so much that it

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.000 
increased the cost so much that it
wasn't<00:02:51.640> really<00:02:51.940> worth<00:02:52.209> it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
wasn't really worth it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.790 
wasn't really worth it
obviously<00:02:54.010> all<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.090> brushes<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.470> see

have<00:03:05.770> they<00:03:06.310> all<00:03:06.459> come<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:06.970> sort<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.330> swipe

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
have they all come to this sort of swipe

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.900 
have they all come to this sort of swipe
points<00:03:08.110> them<00:03:08.260> there's<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.860> reason<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.489> it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
points them there's a reason for that it

it out all with one brush which was the
whole<00:03:22.810> purpose<00:03:23.080> open<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.739> why<00:03:23.950> there<00:03:24.190> were

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
whole purpose open that's why there were

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.060 
whole purpose open that's why there were
no<00:03:24.280> real<00:03:24.940> flat<00:03:25.299> edges<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.900> my<00:03:26.019> brushes<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.590> of
