00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hey, guys, light beauty, brÃ¡s 10 talking. 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.160
 in this video I'm playing Type A320 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 that the matter is serious guys it is 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 very serious that I just discovered 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.150
 that the jacques returned to the old 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.529
 these motherfuckers back I think 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.140
 never came back 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.689
 a second to see my second time 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 seeing their mother's daughters acting in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.640
 I know brazilian irons is a day 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 It is very sad to realize that if 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.130
 can ruin the juca is a minority one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.710
 improvement but may increase 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.149
 the face because neither it she several games 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 radio link headphones for example 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.129
 daisy best-of-three fighting games 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.649
 I really do. I do not understand why. 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.399
 the hackers will spoil you if you spoil 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.820
 for its reputation for spoiling poxa 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 is an expensive game be all the guy 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 job that requires you to face what is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.609
 The game is such a perfect game so well. 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.580
 it was done almost every month has 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.479
 face update put the game very well 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 done and this was already expensive and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 sad but it's really sad 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 although it is perceived that there is a large 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.670
 hunger of the hackers 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.250
 these guys have what you mean what 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.259
 It has super speed and it seems that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.000
 report this problem has a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.159
 automatic sometimes you look like a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 The second I'll kill you already. 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 who criticizes all the time respectful of the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.570
 ref in the one I hurt when 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.180
 He killed someone. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.549
 It kills someone is not that the worst for the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.729
 more advanced as a path in life to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.430
 seriously where they kill someone they change 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 someone's name someone's name is not 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.649
 I mean if I'm playing and the guy is 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.259
 good hacker to kill another person he sends 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.439
 my name for example and also 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.149
 advanced guy even so that here and only 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 Why do they do this program? 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.500
 show does this to give a bathroom 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.990
 server side serv 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.729
 each one has advanced this and can worsen 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.349
 same case but did not realize that for 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.970
 to perceive the name of the guy because he is a clan 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.970
 am 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 I already realized how to play is that of power 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.730
 advertise too but I do not know where I am 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.130

 I am very sad even if already 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.080
 They came back, they only ruin everything, but it's 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.750
