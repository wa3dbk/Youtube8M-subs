00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:10.090
 finally we have got big sofa 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:14.860
 we have not only achieved 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.470
 a remarkable and outstanding martÃ­n fermin 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.810
 in the street is defined by this one 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.619
 by the audience of the large audience of 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 that segment and I'm going to talk about this topic 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.489
 After a few hours he won Spain 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.939
 thrashed Italy has European champion 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.939
 this is the theme 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.360
 we'll see 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.740
 and we asked that in the area 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.350
 mixed football players and all 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.000
 footballers obviously said no 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.030
 but this one outside gave the feeling that 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.550
 Spain needed a game like that not only 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.550
 to win the eurocopa now being 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.820
 the pattern is not only to win the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.530
 eurocopa but a bit to cover for 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.740
 cover your mouth to silence people 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.799
 so he hears what the debates really 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.450
 today they have been in evidence I say no 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.549
 I know I absolutely ask 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.869
 returned to the beginning did not play with six that 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.680
 the first game and has died with 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.680
 you good dead 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.580
 Two towers is interesting because I do not know 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.009
 you but I have the feeling of 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.690
 that in the last three tournaments despite 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.509
 of being supposedly not a title 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.840
 owner would have been a weight 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.039
 huge assistance in the global the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.039
 volley to italy 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.509
 shows that in the end what are the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.590
 good coupons to a good one when 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.840
 left lateral where it has 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.220
 allowed to play well you put one to one 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.740
 human in his position and he remains 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.300
 bad 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 you can have a team how many more 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.150
 midfielders have better is not 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.580
 expert in playing ball plays the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.679
 football and has spoken at the wheel of 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.870
 press and has commented was asked 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.360
 specifically that's why I said that that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.030
 there is a failure to talk about the striker 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 they are attackers and attack and when you 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.900
 defend and you get from behind is more 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.650
 hard to score the first goal is the one that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.540
 defends in today's goal 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.010
 because today they have risen much more than in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.239
 other parts in other courtyards have been left 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.200
 a tad further back today have gone up because 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.690
 forest 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.489
 they told him you're going to play with attacker said 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.820
 39 the three were people who know brand 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.820
 goals 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.480
 lack 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.680
 we can not better played the tournament but 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.680
 let's say we live 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.630
 one goal conceded 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.030
 but we were talking about the people who attack 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.390
 we have to talk about the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.209
 midfielders xavi galindo yes yes but 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.250
 today xavi was a block builder from 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.730
 goal of iniesta also jordi alba 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.590
 that the other one is a fabric analytically 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.080
 statistically in this whole tournament the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700
 defense with more touches in the area 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.270
 contrary is to arbeloa 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.270
 today to make a great goal in the last 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.700
 minute I wanted to mark taco pique are 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.610
 NATO and we also celebrate your trip 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.920
 to reale oysters is that then a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.450
 happy everyone 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.170
 it's that easy and everything sorted through 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.170
 of the ball not 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:06.600
 is the pressure they make when the first 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.120
 or second nothing but good can 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.459
 finish that we are broccoli me 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.150
 I am also left with a positive something 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.800
 Italy 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.680
 we have arrived here where you know what I 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.410
 I would give a lot of pity to be valued 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.740
 in Italy it is a country or a culture 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.740
 criticism that varied success and that this 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.370
 with that
