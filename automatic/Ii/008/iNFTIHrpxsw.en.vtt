00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 everything is ready kick-off that will come 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.410
 beaten by Udine who will attack from 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.719
 right to the left of your TV screens 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.849
 the chievo instead obviously from the part 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.460
 the opposite is immediately the attempt to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 ruin long launch controlled by 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.760
 Trojans of other great shooting of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.520
 that shows a good condition 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.519
 physical and cross for moras too long 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 maria pero wines shot refilled by 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 defender with the number 5 very thin 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 careful then he defends himself as he can on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 Trojan, maybe they make it but continue 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 ends that however loses the moment for 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.840
 to pull in the goal to run a race 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.489
 different dulas let a ball slide 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 that could be dangerous marchioni 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.480
 takes the time to riccardi ball behind 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
 aldo masses that mix flavors must 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.219
 be careful kind in the base 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 finalissima pendolina checks in 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 somehow emanuele then tip 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.260
 aldrovandi tries the right with the left 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.000
 emanuele si di romano who is called ad 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.710
 it the biggest occasion of his 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 Udinese time part paredes shot 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.560
 that overcomes the barrier would love that a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.080
 very good alexa paredes launch cut 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.369
 interesting for knits that a touch of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.560
 head ball that ends directly 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.150
 outside but verona and e 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.950
 in the green background to warm up the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.080
 then a blond da silva tuft 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 obviously a bit of a scarecrow 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.950
 this second time the shooting starts 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.110
 very nice paredes goes there lowering 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.960
 but ends up off the market trajectory a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.409
 back certain important names 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 sorgane sees it at the last moment it is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.299
 open the barrier people in the stands ha 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.630
 risked hitting some fans here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.630
 from silva 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.570
 slips alone then succeeded in 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.640
 recover the standing position to go 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 even to the throne suffered a danger 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.510
 carried by da silva very much on the level 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.220
 of self-esteem now the chievo verona 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.750
 perhaps just rosy at the entrance of da 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 silva seems more convinced than his own 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.570
 left half of paredes ball out 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.280
 and he was really good filippo 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.680
 then very serious also resists the foul of 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.360
 paredes free moras on the right crosses 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.090
 of first intention and bergomas of la 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.130
 word is released opportunity for 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.899
 the udinese knows a lot judging from the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.240
 run-up so it is beautiful 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.730
 for context of first intention ball 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.400
 which ends up in Policoro would have been the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.930
 I read in the miss of attackers rather 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.540
 that a choral but proper maneuver 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.400
 Trojans at the Cashemere Ball of 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.840
 pugliola drives away there I can 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.430
 gain possession of the ball 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.850
 halimi's right is repelled by douglas 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 and then the conclusion of the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.750
 chievo player if I'm not wrong 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.640
 aldrovandi given by mister guidolin on the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.700
 right wing but now challenges crossed 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.780
 still filippo's perfect cross 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.130
 bera today will be called luisa moras 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.440
 anticipated by Trojans that there is one 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.760
 bertoia can re-propose it head chooses 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.920
 the most difficult game moras 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.409
 freezes the balloon the triple arrives 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.989
 whistle of fanton of lodi udinese chievo 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.670
 verona after a game in which there was 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.569
 much to tell the derby with the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.569
 game on 0 to 0
