that we are likely to see I come back in

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.460 
that we are likely to see I come back in
my<00:02:53.370> statement<00:02:53.640> earlier<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.660> our<00:02:54.990> markets

my statement earlier that our markets

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.650 
my statement earlier that our markets
are<00:02:55.709> constrained<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.670> some<00:02:56.850> extent<00:02:57.240> by

are constrained to some extent by
affordability<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.820> answer<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.150> that

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
affordability so the answer to that

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.760 
affordability so the answer to that
question<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.870> simply<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.350> should<00:03:01.620> look

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
question is simply that we should look

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460 
question is simply that we should look

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440
