00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 here we are again, precisely the video 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 second part of the life of the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.269
 forks today we will see how to do 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.289
 maintenance and we start from the tools 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 which serve and will serve in 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.860
 especially finished publications one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:42.050
 flat and one between coach and pd 40 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:45.890
 fat for specific for para or pupil 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.890
 he injured himself 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.420
 in negative of a film or it goes 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.750
 well also a card that you have in it 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.690
 home and this maintenance should be done ie 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.869
 almost every time you come back from 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.630
 tactical track in short we start to see 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.400
 how you make it perfect now let's go 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.300
 to see how it makes one of the forks 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.540
 for one thing, as soon as you get back it looks like a 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:23.890
 through caccese rushed to unscrew the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.890
 but let's see above 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.409
 of the vine 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.189
 over age for fork in order to make 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.119
 take the area contained in the 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.270
 forcelle xvi goes to create a bestseller 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.270
 just simply 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.740
 avoid a little and then call re-screw 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:55.619
 I recommend doing this when 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.760
 the fork is completely spent when 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.760
 there is love on the easel 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.670
 let's do these people both 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.670
 forks e 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.130
 so listen to the content area 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:19.940
 in it we will now go to clean up 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.940
 the dust cover 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.820
 a screwdriver 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.629
 here we go 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.629
 to challenge 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.319
 still dust in its seat 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:08.960
 once paraded with a little paper 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.050
 a little dvd 40 or 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.430
 or brake cleaner 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:33.549
 let's clean the dirt from grease 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:33.549
 that there was all the stem 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.280
 don't die well too 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.280
 above and words 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.520
 here 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.610
 our head is communicative 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.610
 we are going to take it inside 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:14.150
 up above my trolly type 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.150
 a future dirt 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.250
 once this is done we go to 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.800
 take it I say a little fat 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:36.650
 a real fat 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.460
 let's spread everything a little bit 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.460
 the stem 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:55.150
 between 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:56.440
 and dust seal once it is taken 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 the fat 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:10.350
 let's go a lot to the easel and to 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.350
 let the fat and words absorb a little 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.619
 we see south 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.450
 we have to say thanks a little in excess 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.970
 and we pull them 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.200
 the words 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.200
 and more dust 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.020
 perfect we also give a policy in 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.490
 general 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.259
 this is a minimum maintenance between the 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.479
 portella 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:18.330
 then there would be an oil change 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.330
 at least once a year or so 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.460
 change of meat studies conducted ronco 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.460
 dust words 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.410
 what politics 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.410
 just everything 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.000
 perfect to do 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.449
 many 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.449
 greetings to all
