00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 one another and welcome to the third 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.060
 title diary lead as 4 el dorado 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
 the occupation of the developer diary 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.580
 is as always in the description 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.610
 very briefly linked to the content it was about 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.800
 two new religion in america and also 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.949
 for the new freedom that aspire 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 Incidentally, part of the patch will be 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.859
 especially since he first became the religion of meyer in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.539
 You can reform the Meier religion 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.760
 if you have 20 provinces positive 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 stability no revolts and no 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 overexpression possesses if one 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 reformed you lose a big one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.790
 Picture in the picture at the first reform 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 ten small provinces which are 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 depending on culture religion distance 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.860
 pushed back to the capital at the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.070
 you can go to each form more and more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 keep land and the other provinces 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.570
 Finally discovered is international 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 Or start your own depending on whether 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.140
 nation available to you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.469
 or if they are starting new ones 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.469
 have to 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.879
 and then you can not do with some like 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.440
 the districts one is not automatically in 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.479
 kikuz sounds but you can never say 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.670
 press pictures more you have 20 again 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.170
 and just stability can the volt through 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.330
 krimifans persons came the next air 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.890
 and it was just five times it was his 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.140
 reforms doral and in the end you can like 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 then reform at all religions 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.940
 if you recognize his western 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.799
 nation has containers the reforms the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.040
 bolide reforms permanently and in 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.500
 this strong technology bonus the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.200
 religion normal begins with +1 true 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.410
 Believe to +1 possible consultants and in 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.140
 Form juba - 10% of the time - two 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.990
 Global Unrest +10 Infantry fight 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.850
 action a colonist as fourth and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.100
 -20% core bruins then continue to cost in the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.780
 south for the beekeepers there is the region 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.530
 the in team still after a tasty 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.119
 named and this is not about 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 expansion is aimed at the preservation of 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.970
 Authorities really had one 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.490
 new value called authority the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.829
 Authority for rising when you have a big one 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.160
 if you occupy several large areas 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.560
 with low autonomy and she becomes even 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.900
 reduced if you do not care if through events 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.430
 or players or rebels provinces 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.230
 to receive local autonomy 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.239
 the piece is of course still on events 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.250
 now influenced and wise them 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.610
 negative or just positive after what 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.709
 you choose to have monika gates and bring 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.660
 if you have 100 authority and at least 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.359
 one can have ten provinces 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.880
 religious in the religious forms 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.709
 let lose but any car 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.450
 today the garbage has accumulated and it 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.880
 a civil war begins so you get it 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.890
 In the throne contender rebels stack up around 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.209
 To fight these levels one finds the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.709
 civil war you lose two of the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.030
 religious reforms must stop again 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.920
 these may be new 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.510
 here too is just after the last one 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.430
 one can reform one's religion 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.470
 reform if the remaining eight 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.070
 There is also a technology bonus 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.420
 and permanent bonuses of the reforms 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.340
 reform are the bit weaker because 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.290
 you less than six people with it 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.670
 easier are just so much remains 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.819
 easier than the aztecs be there 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.590
 posed 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.889
 invite the intelligent with merely 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.319
 Although anklams and plus 1 -0 05 monthly 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.510
 local autonomy and rich relatively well 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.090
 the form bring ten consecutively 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.030
 manpower recovery +1 colonists already 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.639
 as a second reform 05 annual 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.450
 legitimacy +9 0 55 percent 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.620
 morale a lot of troops and -10% ken bruens 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 Cost exactly had reform were too 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.439
 finally announce how were so far 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.109
 only from screenshots or from that 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.000
 videos can be so group and that is 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.150
 the minimum of 0.05 war fatigue per 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.340
 Month plus unique relationship of the 514 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.609
 discipline +1 cologne is only as 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.099
 fourth reform and -20% quality costs 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.260
 that sounds to me somehow the in 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.260
 China was the strongest second 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.819
 reforms the colonists receives and none 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.230
 provinces slash vasallen loses 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.650
 if you dice reform than 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.849
 Any liquid in China clearly 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.980
 can be stronger than years but it 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.870
 it will show 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.180
 then to the new liberty struggles that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.979
 probably the conquest of paradise beach 15 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.949
 at that time for coordination introduces the 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.720
 new since the year 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.299
 that was always a bit too close 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.070
 simple but quite right it was so 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.599
 good as never the case that really 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.430
 everywhere that have become independent 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.840
 the colonia nation so that they 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.820
 content is now revised for 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.259
 all subjects therefore also for vasals 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.060
 and the staff and this everyone has 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.770
 this one has its own files 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.960
 regardless of the diploma of the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.690
 opinion already lords the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.940
 diplomatic obituary of the relative 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.979
 strength of the relative diplomatic 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.630
 technology and very interesting too 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.240
 so the vasals are a vasall of 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.860
 opinion is all vassals of the ruler 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.210
 had with five strong vasallen and 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.280
 which are stronger together than experience 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.440
 Remember the choice and say hey 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.360
 Huts together we could become free 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.560
 so if so if the local 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.180
 together we are stronger than 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.370
 the liege lord is also a torch 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.960
 Freedom tends to increase 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.889
 leaves 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.509
 be more special like brands and 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.120
 satellite states are more loyal than 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.069
 usually 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.539
 undoubtedly has a much higher 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:23.599
 Freedom Penalty Somalia 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.279
 it 's a bit like before 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.129
 key figures but two key values 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.870
 Organized under 50 are the subjects 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.029
 loyal you pay to send your taxes 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.499
 reject their troops from 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.629
 support offers from is the 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.669
 Freedom describes tables 50 and 100 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.590
 but his and loyal so as attitude 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.939
 increasingly gentlemen then they pay no 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.430
 tax certain social for the 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.139
 colonization to send your army to me 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.699
 in the churches , they would just be around 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.229
 to defend your own products 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.300
 Personally, I find it very interesting 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.680
 and they are actively looking for both 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.000
 after support your independence 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.599
 as well as allied among the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.919
 other two depending on how strong 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.050
 as the freedom strive ever stronger 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.080
 because it just hey we can do that 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.629
 we want to create and increase their value 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.819
 at 100 they become rebellious and then 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.259
 At the moment we see a chance 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.960
 that can explain independently 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.469
 I'm sure of it 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.639
 wars of independence can clarify it 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.990
 does not sound somehow so that the 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.659
 Of course, really only from 100 tours 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.250
 but from 50 so to speak, the stone comes into 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.810
 because they are then federal and 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.120
 even faster freedom strive 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.800
 It sounds like that to me and when it does 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.810
 just the chances explain war of 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.779
 to call public all allies 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.659
 we are now all supportive in the 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.270
 War and all allied 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.370
 both the allies of the support 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.569
 as well as the supporters of the vasals 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.250
 so pretty much can be pretty fast 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.930
 big war or others 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.219
 franz is a pretty big one today 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.939
 war for the vaals from the fence 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:46.800
 to get broken 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:49.610
 the first of today's diary to 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.610
 there must be a lot of joy
