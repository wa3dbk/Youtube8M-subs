00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.320
 Now have fun at the screening 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.190

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.460

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.820
 enemy 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.320
 stay enforced for gamers 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.900
 but none 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.800
 there are those who are afraid now 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.800
 even from the battlefield 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.660
 I like to be able to head 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.560
 What did 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:59.170
 you would have to attack my co-land 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.170
 There is a lot through that 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.280
 he wanted people to be gathered 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:07.410
 from losses gains 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.880
 it should look good on us 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.880
 So have a lot 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.290
 Napoli dies 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.069
 Finally , there were films from 64 Strom 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.210
 the nice French from behind well 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.210
 rust is help by the way if you want 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:42.150
 I expect me from me if you 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.430
 that can not see is on the way 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:51.150
 because somehow I would have you the 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.150
 I'll just play it again 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.470
 But first reinbek otherwise with the 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.580
 candles 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.310

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.030

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.169
 battlefield 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.150
 that was exactly what you read mine 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.560
 a further way 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.400
 why should I or that was what I think 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.750
 I bottle so wonderful more like this 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.009
 I have never had a hot match 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.330
 seen why martin sepp team gets 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.900
 actually every time this weird 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.220
 medal 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.410

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:29.789

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:38.360
 note that the 6500 is not there from 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:38.360
 about which 60 come 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.389
 Well then people, we'll see you 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.830
 the next van fight and if one 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.940
 it is exciting that this is a match 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.070
 although i have the title of people 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.070
