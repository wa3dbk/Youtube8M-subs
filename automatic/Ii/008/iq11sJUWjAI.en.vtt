00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.299
 and good if everyone here makes comments and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.940
 I bring you a gameplay of chipas you like 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.780
 you are watching I will teach to say what 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 what are the simple tricks 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.910
 and well let's start the first one is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.380
 one of the most basic and that you have to 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.110
 learn to do difficult tricks 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.360
 is to give this button here and do the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.090
 stepping on the ball what you need to do is 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.520
 keep these letters and make the feint 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.980
 backwards and the matrix towards itself thus 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.080
 he said to go the tapes and then others 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.610
 very easy bike bicycles 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.650
 can do transform if it is not done 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.540
 here to the bicycle doing so 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.540
 as if it were a rabona hint that in 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.970
 these three main quotes 13 says that 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.970
 he teaches you later previously 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.510
 the next one is that the roulette that is going 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 to do so is the abra cadabra sorry is 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.489
 silly roulette I think it was like that 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.909
 the next you have to learn to 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.710
 make will be the abracadabra 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.710
 it's like roulette but vice versa 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.520
 to see another very simple that you have to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520
 do 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.900
 Sometimes I hang my hat 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 Thank you 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 school hat 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.350
 well let's go behind took that only 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.189
 a little more difficult like elastic 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.189
 What are you waiting for 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.760
 so good the next one we'll have to 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.420
 will be he 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.490
 maybe the value and the reverse 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.760
 and work on the reverse and when the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.150
 father player 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.360
 it's pretty simple good simple other 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.700
 time he threatens backwards and backwards and is 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.200
 the same but pull it down towards 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.640
 up is worth another is keeping this 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.640
 button here I 'm sorry here 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.220
 this what we have to do is like this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:29.170
 shit now look with roulette 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.940
 with this dribble is perfect for 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.940
 difficult difficulty being able 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.750
 but 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.250
 the retarded I do not understand why 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.910
 try to do again 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.910
 poor 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:58.080
 another one that you have to do who 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.080
 you keep waiting here I threaten back 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.570
 it's very difficult I already saw it 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.900
 juggling up and down up and 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.440
 down and we go around the world 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.240
 good when they feel like it 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.760
 to the forgiveness for the insults I decided 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.760
 play in mongoliths to others who want 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.370
 fixed signals value giant days that 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 you do this although you also ruled 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.439
 crazy to the players 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.859
 another also filed the cord is not 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.859
 practice is also easy 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.020
 to this saint 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.680
 another simpler was the feint towards 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.190
 back and then forward then lifts 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.480
 the ball 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.880
 to see another one that is the man so is 360 what 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:12.940
 that more static I do not know if I'm here 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.260
 the full lb and as if it were 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.260
 true or not 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:25.710
 I want 300,000 points 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.410
 the complicated feast and to catch a hundred 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.180
 600 and if this one is very difficult 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.210
 then another that he wants since I 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.090
 I love it, I'm here, 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.100
 makes the goal and not school 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.960
 we have already finished let's say let's go over 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.490
 a little bit the hardest thing is that it's the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.490
 first I've done the demon school 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.710
 the still 360 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.710
 the elastic touch 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.750
 when he 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.400
 let's say extreme as it was called touching 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.400
 here and r &amp; b keep backwards the reverse 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.490
 click to the east from here in front 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:16.180
 so for one of huelva thank you heat 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.710
 I have been not distinguishing many people 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.360
 He threaded back and forth and returns to 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.670
 He does then again doing well 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.100
 double up and now turn to 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.860
 Soul world will accumulate like I know 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.230
 how do I put another thing to organize 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.510
 forward the island of kish and the 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.220
 levantica making Vaseline 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.030
 another thing is that you are still the list 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.030
 the X and the pica 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.110
 good we get quality shots 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.099
 do with this button here you go towards 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.630
 in front of 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.770
 fans 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.770
 It's a bit shit 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.640
 do the work that you do not do 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.020
 players is going to keep rv and 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.360

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.360
