00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
such a travel we have just travels to

but that's all most interesting is in my

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.500 
but that's all most interesting is in my
opinion<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:57.510> find<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.750> places<00:02:59.740> where<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.940> to
