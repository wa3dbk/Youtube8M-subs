00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.730 

so<00:00:07.210> here<00:00:07.360> we<00:00:07.450> have<00:00:07.569> a<00:00:07.600> bit<00:00:07.810> of<00:00:07.840> a<00:00:07.960> variation<00:00:08.650> on

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
so here we have a bit of a variation on

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.039 
so here we have a bit of a variation on
a<00:00:08.800> theme<00:00:08.920> this<00:00:09.309> step<00:00:09.580> cause<00:00:09.850> down<00:00:10.150> sit<00:00:11.020> down

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
a theme this step cause down sit down

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.990 
a theme this step cause down sit down
caused<00:00:11.500> by<00:00:11.740> a<00:00:11.770> fallen<00:00:12.190> tree<00:00:12.219> where<00:00:12.639> the<00:00:12.730> trail

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
caused by a fallen tree where the trail

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.850 
caused by a fallen tree where the trail
has<00:00:13.539> built<00:00:13.719> up<00:00:13.840> one<00:00:14.020> side<00:00:14.260> and<00:00:14.289> pulling<00:00:14.770> away

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
has built up one side and pulling away

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.680 
has built up one side and pulling away
the<00:00:14.950> other<00:00:15.250> let's<00:00:15.789> create<00:00:16.059> us<00:00:16.180> a<00:00:16.299> nice<00:00:16.450> at<00:00:16.630> the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
the other let's create us a nice at the

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.170 
the other let's create us a nice at the
step<00:00:16.930> in<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.140> trail<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:18.820> to<00:00:18.880> look<00:00:19.030> at<00:00:19.090> this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
step in the trail have to look at this

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.760 
step in the trail have to look at this
one<00:00:19.420> because<00:00:19.660> where<00:00:20.199> we've<00:00:20.350> looked<00:00:20.529> at<00:00:20.650> some

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
one because where we've looked at some

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.470 
one because where we've looked at some
fairly<00:00:20.920> simplistic<00:00:21.430> straight-line<00:00:22.090> steps

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
fairly simplistic straight-line steps

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.260 
fairly simplistic straight-line steps
here<00:00:23.230> we've<00:00:23.530> got<00:00:23.710> twisting<00:00:24.520> trail<00:00:24.760> coming<00:00:25.090> in

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
here we've got twisting trail coming in

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.240 
here we've got twisting trail coming in
so<00:00:26.020> as<00:00:26.140> you<00:00:26.260> round<00:00:26.530> the<00:00:26.740> corner<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.220> first

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
so as you round the corner the first

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.900 
so as you round the corner the first
sight<00:00:27.760> of<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:28.150> step<00:00:29.080> down<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:30.070> closer<00:00:30.400> and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
sight of the step down is closer and

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.389 
sight of the step down is closer and
therefore<00:00:31.780> it's<00:00:32.559> very<00:00:32.680> easy<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.010> get<00:00:33.100> sucked

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
therefore it's very easy to get sucked

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.979 
therefore it's very easy to get sucked
into<00:00:33.579> the<00:00:33.820> section<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.420> staring<00:00:34.750> into<00:00:34.780> the

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
into the section and staring into the

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.959 
into the section and staring into the
section<00:00:35.440> more<00:00:36.100> than<00:00:36.309> that<00:00:36.460> as<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.940> approach

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
section more than that as you approach

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.930 
section more than that as you approach
you'll<00:00:37.870> notice<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.379> stump<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.489> towards<00:00:39.850> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
you'll notice a stump on the towards the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.569 
you'll notice a stump on the towards the
exit<00:00:40.329> point<00:00:40.570> or<00:00:41.079> mid<00:00:41.409> sections<00:00:41.890> with<00:00:42.100> popping

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
exit point or mid sections with popping

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.090 
exit point or mid sections with popping
through<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:44.079> it's<00:00:44.170> very<00:00:44.350> clear<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.589> see<00:00:44.890> that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
through and it's very clear to see that

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.649 
through and it's very clear to see that
two<00:00:45.280> things<00:00:45.489> have<00:00:45.670> happened<00:00:45.819> here<00:00:46.120> firstly

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
two things have happened here firstly

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.689 
two things have happened here firstly
because<00:00:47.649> of<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:47.829> distance<00:00:48.190> before<00:00:48.339> people

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
because of the distance before people

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.309 
because of the distance before people
feel<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.089> they<00:00:49.210> have<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.420> roll<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:50.050> because

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
feel that they have to roll this because

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:51.479 
feel that they have to roll this because
haven't<00:00:50.499> got<00:00:50.589> enough<00:00:50.710> speed<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.100> pop<00:00:51.280> off

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
haven't got enough speed to pop off

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.680 
haven't got enough speed to pop off
they're<00:00:51.729> not<00:00:51.789> pushing<00:00:51.999> through<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.539> bike

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
they're not pushing through the bike

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.250 
they're not pushing through the bike
enough<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:54.339> as<00:00:55.059> they<00:00:55.300> come<00:00:55.449> down<00:00:55.629> hard<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
enough and as they come down hard on the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.829 
enough and as they come down hard on the
front<00:00:56.499> or<00:00:57.010> either<00:00:57.339> by<00:00:57.550> rolling<00:00:57.999> it<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.210> not

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
front or either by rolling it and not

front or either by rolling it and not
getting<00:00:58.989> moving<00:00:59.800> their<00:01:00.100> hips<00:01:00.339> enough<00:01:00.639> to<00:01:00.819> the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
getting moving their hips enough to the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.360 
getting moving their hips enough to the
back<00:01:01.479> will<00:01:01.629> pop<00:01:01.839> up<00:01:02.050> or<00:01:02.649> by<00:01:02.889> trying<00:01:03.159> to<00:01:03.219> push

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
back will pop up or by trying to push

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.530 
back will pop up or by trying to push
through<00:01:03.549> but<00:01:03.729> not<00:01:03.819> pushing<00:01:04.239> through<00:01:04.449> with

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
through but not pushing through with

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.450 
through but not pushing through with
enough<00:01:04.720> commitment<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.860> chain<00:01:06.100> rings<00:01:06.340> have

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
enough commitment the chain rings have

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.070 
enough commitment the chain rings have
started<00:01:06.820> bashing<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.720> see<00:01:07.870> some

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
started bashing and you can see some

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.340 
started bashing and you can see some
scroll<00:01:08.380> marks<00:01:08.680> down<00:01:08.860> there<00:01:09.159> which<00:01:10.260> equates<00:01:11.260> to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
scroll marks down there which equates to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.920 
scroll marks down there which equates to
spending<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.820> big<00:01:12.970> ring<00:01:14.760> secondly<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
spending on the big ring secondly you

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.250 
spending on the big ring secondly you
can<00:01:17.080> see<00:01:17.200> how<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.350> trailer<00:01:17.620> started<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.130> drift

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
can see how the trailer started to drift

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.750 
can see how the trailer started to drift
and<00:01:20.260> I'll<00:01:20.410> put<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:20.650> down<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
and I'll put this down to the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.460 
and I'll put this down to the
performance<00:01:22.240> cue<00:01:22.420> down<00:01:22.540> here<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.080> visual

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
performance cue down here the visual

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.320 
performance cue down here the visual
performance<00:01:23.890> give<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.250> stamp<00:01:24.490> which<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.240> you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
performance give the stamp which if you

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.760 
performance give the stamp which if you
get<00:01:25.480> things<00:01:25.690> wrong<00:01:25.870> could<00:01:26.110> become<00:01:26.230> a<00:01:26.380> fairly

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
get things wrong could become a fairly

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.040 
get things wrong could become a fairly
major<00:01:26.950> input<00:01:27.490> performance<00:01:27.970> cue<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.840> ask

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
major input performance cue and ask

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.200 
major input performance cue and ask
people<00:01:29.320> around<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.650> corner<00:01:30.040> spot<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.000> log

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
people around the corner spot the log

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.720
