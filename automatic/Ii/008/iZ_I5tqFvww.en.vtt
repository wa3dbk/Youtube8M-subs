00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello I'm the john mayer from the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 show real cologne nehrenfeld now 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.959
 I tell them what to look for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.560
 please take care of the right chains here 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:23.340
 take care that the oil is evenly in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.970
 a thin film on disks inside 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.970
 occurs 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 for that reason very important to it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 When driving the oil I go through quite normal 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.440
 the mutations outward thus pushes 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 This can be wonderful anywhere between 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 the individual reunited with this one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 chain recommends itself to a new one 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.100
 If you are with such a chain 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 continue 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 this is the ultimate wear 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 or that something broke 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 is preprogrammed at the gears 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.460
 if the chain then so accordingly 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.500
 looks we are very clear here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.390
 that the limbs are very steep 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 means the chain can be in this case 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.430
 not perfect on the gears 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.850
 expire and thus they have none 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 correct traction in her 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 drive system in this tooth government 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.390
 we can see very well what the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.119
 driver had previously driven and indeed 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 that the teeth on this middle 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.780
 chain leaf worn out very clearly 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.900
 are the effects and these waves 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.540
 Breaking down to see clearly 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.580
 in comparison this little chainring 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.760
 that it has been driven very little 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.060
 there are the teeth actually like 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.060
 new when teeth of a chain grade 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.420
 It should look just like that then 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.330
 In any case, to change a chain 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.360
 and accordingly also the middle one 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.920
 Chainring then the chains can rat 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.920
 be reused
