00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
breaking now as the support role I'll

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.930 
breaking now as the support role I'll
give<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.500> archers<00:02:41.860> mic<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.460> they<00:02:42.610> can<00:02:42.760> hit

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
give the archers mic so they can hit

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
door breakers is the difference between

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.480

the door down this has saved those
little<00:02:53.830> guys<00:02:53.980> more<00:02:54.580> than<00:02:54.910> once<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.840> is

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
little guys more than once and this is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.450 
little guys more than once and this is
also<00:02:56.170> really<00:02:56.470> good<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:56.740> making<00:02:57.010> sure<00:02:57.280> that

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
also really good for making sure that

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.520 
also really good for making sure that
you<00:02:57.580> successfully<00:02:57.940> channel<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.780> hero<00:02:59.050> but<00:02:59.470> I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
you successfully channel a hero but I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.420

would<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.710> to<00:02:59.800> point<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.220> this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
would like to point out that this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.280

strategy<00:03:00.670> was<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.240> smoothly<00:03:01.630> because<00:03:01.959> my

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
strategy was going smoothly because my

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.540 
strategy was going smoothly because my

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
still fun as well i just kind of like

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.750 
still fun as well i just kind of like
the<00:05:43.900> mechanics<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.860> game<00:05:44.889> maybe<00:05:45.370> because

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
the mechanics of the game maybe because

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.790 
the mechanics of the game maybe because
i<00:05:45.880> like<00:05:46.090> MOBAs<00:05:46.600> but<00:05:47.050> don't<00:05:47.200> get<00:05:47.290> me<00:05:47.440> wrong<00:05:47.590> it's

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
i like MOBAs but don't get me wrong it's

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.440 
i like MOBAs but don't get me wrong it's
not<00:05:47.950> perfect<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:48.550> i<00:05:48.639> definitely<00:05:48.940> think<00:05:49.300> it

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
not perfect and i definitely think it

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.300 
not perfect and i definitely think it
needs<00:05:49.660> a<00:05:49.780> lot<00:05:50.020> more<00:05:50.080> tweaking<00:05:50.770> probably<00:05:51.190> some

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
needs a lot more tweaking probably some

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.010 
needs a lot more tweaking probably some
beta<00:05:51.520> phases<00:05:51.940> with<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.180> community<00:05:52.690> will<00:05:52.900> be

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
beta phases with the community will be

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.840 
beta phases with the community will be
nice<00:05:53.229> like<00:05:53.710> for<00:05:53.919> instance<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.400> heroes<00:05:54.700> are

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
nice like for instance the heroes are

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.000 
nice like for instance the heroes are
not<00:05:55.060> much<00:05:55.270> of<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.540> threat<00:05:55.750> when<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.440> enemy<00:05:56.800> team

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
not much of a threat when the enemy team

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.920 
not much of a threat when the enemy team
sponsor<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.729> can<00:05:57.880> just<00:05:58.090> go<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.479> kill<00:05:58.810> it

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
sponsor you can just go and kill it

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.600 
sponsor you can just go and kill it
pretty<00:05:59.200> easily<00:05:59.440> because<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.190> heroes<00:06:00.460> own

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
pretty easily because the heroes own

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.520 
pretty easily because the heroes own
attack<00:06:00.970> anyone<00:06:01.419> they<00:06:01.570> just<00:06:01.750> go<00:06:01.900> straight<00:06:02.289> for

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
attack anyone they just go straight for

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.620 
attack anyone they just go straight for
the<00:06:02.590> lord<00:06:02.919> so<00:06:03.340> they<00:06:03.520> just<00:06:03.550> kind<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.060> sit<00:06:04.389> there

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
the lord so they just kind of sit there

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.750 
the lord so they just kind of sit there
and<00:06:04.780> take<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.139> beating<00:06:05.919> i<00:06:06.130> think<00:06:06.430> what's<00:06:06.610> the

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
and take that beating i think what's the

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.490 
and take that beating i think what's the
game<00:06:06.970> comes<00:06:07.270> out<00:06:07.419> and<00:06:07.630> everyone<00:06:07.960> kind<00:06:08.139> of<00:06:08.320> gets

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
game comes out and everyone kind of gets

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.710 
game comes out and everyone kind of gets
used<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:09.130> stronghold<00:06:09.520> it's<00:06:10.330> gonna<00:06:10.539> be

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
used to stronghold it's gonna be

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.840 
used to stronghold it's gonna be
interesting<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.289> see<00:06:11.410> how<00:06:11.590> long<00:06:12.280> does<00:06:12.520> grit

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
interesting to see how long does grit

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.000 
interesting to see how long does grit
last<00:06:13.180> are<00:06:13.570> they<00:06:13.720> gonna<00:06:13.840> even<00:06:14.229> make<00:06:14.260> it<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.889> the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010

last are they gonna even make it to the
door<00:06:15.190> i<00:06:15.490> think<00:06:15.789> they<00:06:15.910> were<00:06:15.970> definitely

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
door i think they were definitely

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:17.760 
door i think they were definitely
thinking<00:06:16.720> about<00:06:16.810> this<00:06:17.139> when<00:06:17.320> they're<00:06:17.410> adding

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
thinking about this when they're adding

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.100 
thinking about this when they're adding
more<00:06:17.950> control<00:06:18.430> to<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.700> game<00:06:18.970> and<00:06:19.270> changing<00:06:19.960> up

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
more control to the game and changing up

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.320 
more control to the game and changing up
