00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
so that's the first thing we track how

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.970 
so that's the first thing we track how
hard<00:02:31.000> do<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.299> play<00:02:31.569> where<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.319> accountable

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
hard do we play where we accountable

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.830 
hard do we play where we accountable
both<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.670> run<00:02:33.849> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.030> pass<00:02:34.299> game<00:02:34.629> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
both in the run in the pass game and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.930 
both in the run in the pass game and
then<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.470> evaluate<00:02:36.040> our<00:02:36.190> technique<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.819> so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
then we evaluate our technique and so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.089 
then we evaluate our technique and so
again<00:02:37.209> that's<00:02:37.599> what<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> look<00:02:38.379> at<00:02:38.590> when<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.769> start
