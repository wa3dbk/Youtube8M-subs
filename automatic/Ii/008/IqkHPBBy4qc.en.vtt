00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
now only three blocks of iron and four

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
now only three blocks of iron and four
iron<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.649> gets<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> shape<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
iron and gets in the shape of that and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.650 
iron and gets in the shape of that and
bam<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> anvil<00:00:37.380> also<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.480> UI

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
bam we got the anvil also the you the UI

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.270 
bam we got the anvil also the you the UI
right<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> little<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.800> different<00:00:41.190> if

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
right here is a little bit different if

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950 
right here is a little bit different if
I<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> obviously<00:00:42.629> says<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I put this in here it obviously says I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
I put this in here it obviously says I
can't<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.370> i<00:00:44.399> don't

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
can't do that that is because i don't

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
can't do that that is because i don't
have<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.000> other<00:00:45.149> shovel<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.649> are<00:00:46.770> my

have the other shovel and so here are my

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
have the other shovel and so here are my
two<00:00:46.920> chain<00:00:47.280> enchantments<00:00:47.940> efficiency<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
two chain enchantments efficiency to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
two chain enchantments efficiency to
efficiency<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.710> unbreaking<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.280> giving

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
efficiency one and unbreaking one giving

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
efficiency one and unbreaking one giving
me<00:00:50.760> efficiency<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> non-breaking<00:00:52.530> one

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
me efficiency to a non-breaking one

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
me efficiency to a non-breaking one
which<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.870> these<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.170> combined<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.219> say<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
which is these two combined but say I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
which is these two combined but say I
only<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:58.170> repair<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.800> don't<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
mix it simply you get the material of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
mix it simply you get the material of
which<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.660> item<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.229> made<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
which the item is made so this is a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
bit of enchantment and the material and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580 
bit of enchantment and the material and
you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.850> repair<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.990> helps<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.470> you

touching each other they would both go

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
touching each other they would both go
on<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.399> now<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.970> repeater<00:01:45.450> activates

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.330 
whatever state it is on it stays on that
state<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.020> were<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.259> turn<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.680> off<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
state but if I were to turn this off and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.330 
state but if I were to turn this off and
turn<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.500> excuse<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.619> turn<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> off<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
turn this on excuse me turn that off and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.550 
turn this on excuse me turn that off and
then<00:01:59.490> lock<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.820> first<00:02:00.600> off<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
then lock it first off I do like the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.740 
then lock it first off I do like the
little<00:02:01.829> bedrock<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.610> puts<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.210> making<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
little bedrock it puts on it making it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
little bedrock it puts on it making it
look<00:02:04.140> locked<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:05.460> if<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.700> were<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> turn<00:02:06.060> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
look locked now if I were to turn this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.419 
look locked now if I were to turn this
on<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.659> will<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.170> past<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> repeater<00:02:07.950> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
on it will not get past the repeater so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
on it will not get past the repeater so
this<00:02:08.610> could<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.819> used<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.270> many<00:02:09.660> many<00:02:10.050> things

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
this could be used for many many things

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.320 
this could be used for many many things
I<00:02:10.709> assume<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.340> will<00:02:11.520> help

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
I assume this will help

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.270 
I assume this will help
keep<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.660> cluttered<00:02:14.140> mess<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.710> all<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
keep that cluttered mess of all that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.500 
keep that cluttered mess of all that
redstone<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:16.570> little<00:02:17.260> bit<00:02:17.350> less<00:02:17.610> also<00:02:18.610> now<00:02:19.480> I

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
redstone a little bit less also now I

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.720 
redstone a little bit less also now I
can<00:02:19.750> get<00:02:19.870> rid<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.080> these<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.100> we<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:21.550> it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
can get rid of these so we have it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.920 
can get rid of these so we have it
turning<00:02:22.360> look<00:02:22.960> at<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.230> that's<00:02:23.980> very<00:02:24.370> nice

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
turning look at that that's very nice

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.440 
turning look at that that's very nice
that's<00:02:25.930> no<00:02:26.350> longer<00:02:26.620> trampled<00:02:27.430> crops<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:28.300> i

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
that's no longer trampled crops which i

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.720 
that's no longer trampled crops which i
guess<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.660> just<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.260> little<00:02:30.190> thing<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.430> they

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
guess is just a little thing that they

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.430 
guess is just a little thing that they
forgot<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.180> add<00:02:31.300> because<00:02:31.630> no<00:02:32.020> animals

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
forgot to add because no animals

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.010 
forgot to add because no animals

trampled crops so if you have a bunch of

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.470 
trampled crops so if you have a bunch of
bats<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.470> night<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.850> don't<00:02:37.030> want<00:02:37.270> them

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
bats at night and you don't want them
