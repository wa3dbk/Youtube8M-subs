00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
clan and I have developed a pretty

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
clan and I have developed a pretty
useful<00:00:31.919> method<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.519> getting<00:00:32.759> into<00:00:32.940> games

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
useful method for getting into games

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.930 
useful method for getting into games
together<00:00:33.629> is<00:00:33.900> really<00:00:34.050> simple<00:00:34.500> too<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:35.730> meant

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
together is really simple too this meant

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.640 
together is really simple too this meant
that<00:00:36.000> works<00:00:36.269> best<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.900> small<00:00:37.199> group<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
that works best with a small group of

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.860 
that works best with a small group of
people<00:00:37.829> two<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.250> four<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> usually<00:00:39.449> works<00:00:39.690> at

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
people two to four and usually works at

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.990 
people two to four and usually works at
earlier<00:00:40.230> late<00:00:40.500> hours<00:00:40.949> but<00:00:41.220> you<00:00:41.369> can<00:00:41.549> get<00:00:41.729> into

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
earlier late hours but you can get into

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
earlier late hours but you can get into
a<00:00:42.030> game<00:00:42.510> at<00:00:42.780> any<00:00:42.930> time<00:00:43.260> using<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.190> method

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a game at any time using this method

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.600 
a game at any time using this method
most<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:45.479> 75%<00:00:46.610> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
most of the time it's about 75% so
