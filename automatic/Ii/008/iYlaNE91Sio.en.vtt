00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.869
 in love with her and it's kind of like that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 a love triangle nec her and a guy 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.070
 She likes him so he really is. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 charming because it would be ozu 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.229
 He says nothing and speaks very little. 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 When she sees him it seems she will win. 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.400
 what then the image that it passes like this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 a little of it is very interesting for 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.930
 anyone who finds it is a little bit like that 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.630
 That 's why it's in the tenth and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.549
 do not play I come know naruto I do not 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.680
 I know if his name is exactly this self 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.409
 I 'm not sure you write like this. 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.430
 and I do not watch our boy in the other 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.970
 but when I saw it here 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.880
 Your image is very beautiful so it has 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.350
 a crash let's say naruto that I 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840
 can teach the third character 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.110
 they preferred to be impracticable I do not know if they die 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 but it is the excerpt from the nec and will take place 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.950
 on a list truck that is the panda 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.990
 dragon good to see you 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 I think it was good, I'm not sure. 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.340
 but I think the dragon ballot bank that 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.130
 cover because I when I showed up 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.950
 I thought well sized never know son 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.959
 spoke on a straight and legal budget 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.300
 so I guess I can say it was 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.989
 nursery in seventh place also 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.900
 dragon ball z well android 17 that 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.360

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.370
 hey that black hair show he knew 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.350

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.290
 really was a national critic and the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.709
 government and made a place came 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.840
 moncloa seat of the bank was small and I 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.890
 I used to love it when I used to. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.720
 pkk's brother 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.220
 So I'll drop you a doctor or both. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 mills ours that move it more 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.260
 I grew up then I had to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.390
 so promises in one place came Ricardo and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.640
 a freshman issue of mm per year to 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.799
 They are twins and they 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.989
 pretend early type near the 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.970
 small girls get more filmed and 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.640
 yes for him but passionate and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.290
 actually they are very cuddly only 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.940
 very sweetheart at the time that 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.060
 animal because it has several celine girls 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.820
 only genius is one of my favorites 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.519
 now begins my real top that 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.080
 was thus a competition because these 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.540
 four coming now are mine 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.549
 then complicated to choose which 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.820
 was to stay in first place and fourth 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.400
 place is the air of the death note is l 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.549

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.440
 strange and I only know because a 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.870
 Passion for him, do not ask me. 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.940
 It's interesting to credit people, I do not know. 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.580
 I had more right to the low level 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.790
 cia 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.410
 So he stayed in the room drinking in the kitchen. 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.230
 end was even preferring then 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.740
 really was complicated and third 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.410
 place was the Chilean lion of galley in the 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.980
 zodiac I think my thing more 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.170

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.480

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.609
 acute paixonitis thousand to 3 low 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.709

 armor that deal like that 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.030
 and that long hair it really 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.790
 I was trying to ring frei 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.820

 knights of the zodiac did not help 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.760
 because they expected the whole situation to be 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.700

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.470
