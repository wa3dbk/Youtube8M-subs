00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
this is the Estes control sinker oh and

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is the Estes control sinker oh and
this<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.750> marked<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> box<00:00:10.590> as<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.130> world's

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
this is marked on the box as the world's

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.620 
this is marked on the box as the world's
smallest<00:00:11.840> remote<00:00:12.840> control<00:00:13.139> quad<00:00:13.410> quad<00:00:14.099> copter

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
smallest remote control quad quad copter

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.330 
smallest remote control quad quad copter
to<00:00:15.630> give<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.839> an<00:00:15.929> idea<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.830> how<00:00:16.949> small

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
to give you an idea on just how small

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
to give you an idea on just how small
the<00:00:17.609> sizes<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.119> placed<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.480> quarter<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the sizes I placed a quarter here the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
the sizes I placed a quarter here the
quarter<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.680> actually<00:00:20.220> bigger<00:00:20.460> than<00:00:20.580> than<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
quarter is actually bigger than than the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
quarter is actually bigger than than the
head<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.320> copter<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.519> can

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
head of the copter right here as you can

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.480 
head of the copter right here as you can
see<00:00:23.670> not<00:00:24.449> including<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> arms<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
see not including the arms and the and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.779 
see not including the arms and the and
the<00:00:27.000> propellers<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.810> fact<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:29.010> quarter<00:00:29.640> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the propellers in fact the quarter is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
the propellers in fact the quarter is
bigger<00:00:30.029> than<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> same<00:00:31.679> size

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
bigger than or just about the same size

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.860 
bigger than or just about the same size
as<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> propellers<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.820> full<00:00:33.590> full<00:00:34.590> diameter

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
as the propellers a full full diameter

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
as the propellers a full full diameter
so<00:00:36.870> that's<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.500> size<00:00:38.190> comparison<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
so that's just a size comparison and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.549 
so that's just a size comparison and
compared<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> controller<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:40.020> it's

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
compared to the controller here it's

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.299 
compared to the controller here it's
obviously<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.360> very<00:00:42.360> very<00:00:42.660> small<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:44.250> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
obviously just very very small but it is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
obviously just very very small but it is
even<00:00:45.059> though<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.539> small<00:00:45.840> controller

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
even though it's a very small controller

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
even though it's a very small controller
it's<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.710> usable<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.460> smooth<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it's very very usable very smooth and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.310 
it's very very usable very smooth and
everything<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.160> um<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> yeah<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> liked

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
everything like that um so yeah I liked

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
everything like that um so yeah I liked
it<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.829> said<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> marked<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> box

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
it like I said it is marked on the box

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.900 
it like I said it is marked on the box
as<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> world's<00:00:54.719> smallest<00:00:54.870> quadcopter<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
as the world's smallest quadcopter and I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
as the world's smallest quadcopter and I
haven't<00:00:57.270> seen<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.660> smaller<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.500> general<00:00:59.010> but

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
haven't seen one smaller in general but

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
haven't seen one smaller in general but
I'm<00:00:59.609> sure<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.120> small<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.510> commercially

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I'm sure it's as small as commercially

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.130 
I'm sure it's as small as commercially
available<00:01:02.270> quadcopter<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.629> anybody

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
available quadcopter as in anybody

right now online or wherever I bought it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300 
right now online or wherever I bought it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
at Fry's for just 40 bucks and when they

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
at Fry's for just 40 bucks and when they
say<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> smallest<00:01:11.909> quadcopter<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.540> believe<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
say the smallest quadcopter I believe it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.510 
say the smallest quadcopter I believe it
because<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> gave<00:01:13.830> me<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.040> option<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> give

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
because if you gave me an option to give

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
because if you gave me an option to give
one<00:01:14.640> any<00:01:14.790> smaller<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
one any smaller I would not want it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.280 
one any smaller I would not want it
because<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.640> thing's<00:01:18.000> fairly<00:01:18.720> hard<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> fly

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
because this thing's fairly hard to fly

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
because this thing's fairly hard to fly
just<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.520> visibility<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
just because the visibility of it and it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.510 
just because the visibility of it and it
has<00:01:21.960> pretty<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.320> range<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.040> furthest<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
has pretty good range the furthest I

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730 
has pretty good range the furthest I
flown<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.000> outside<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.259> probably<00:01:25.590> got

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
flown it was outside and it probably got

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.039 
flown it was outside and it probably got
about<00:01:25.860> 40<00:01:26.700> feet<00:01:26.909> away<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.180> me<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.810> didn't

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
about 40 feet away from me and I didn't

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.719 
about 40 feet away from me and I didn't
have<00:01:28.140> any<00:01:28.290> problems<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.250> don't<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.549> what

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have any problems so I don't know what

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
have any problems so I don't know what
the<00:01:29.850> max<00:01:30.060> range<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:31.020> flying<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the max range is but I was flying it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
the max range is but I was flying it
very<00:01:31.590> comfortably<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.130> 40<00:01:32.460> feet<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.090> only

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
very comfortably at 40 feet the only

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.960 
very comfortably at 40 feet the only
thing<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:34.710> 30<00:01:34.979> feet<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.310> your

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
thing is at over 30 feet you your

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
thing is at over 30 feet you your
orientation<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.140> gone<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.500> you're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
orientation is kind of gone if you're

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
orientation is kind of gone if you're
flying<00:01:37.799> during<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> day<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:40.049> don't

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
flying during the day because you don't

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380 
flying during the day because you don't
know<00:01:40.409> what's<00:01:40.710> forward<00:01:41.189> back<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.850> left<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
know what's forward back and left and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.609 
know what's forward back and left and
right<00:01:42.600> you're<00:01:42.780> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> flying<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.409> over<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
right you're kind of flying all over the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.920 
right you're kind of flying all over the
place<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.909> past<00:01:45.149> 30<00:01:45.420> feet<00:01:45.659> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
place so when you get past 30 feet it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
place so when you get past 30 feet it's
kind<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> iffy<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.619> fly<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.310> really

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
kind of iffy to fly so you don't really

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.399 
kind of iffy to fly so you don't really
want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.600> nice<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
want to but it's nice to know that the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.399 
want to but it's nice to know that the
range<00:01:49.710> lets<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.310> beyond<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.030> point<00:01:51.420> some

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
range lets you go beyond that point some

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.840 
range lets you go beyond that point some
cool<00:01:52.590> features<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.130> noticing<00:01:53.399> earlier

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
cool features I was noticing earlier

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179 
cool features I was noticing earlier
well<00:01:54.689> first<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.409> put<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> triple-a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
well first of all I put the triple-a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.649 
well first of all I put the triple-a
batteries<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.299> takes<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
batteries on here it just takes to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
batteries on here it just takes to
triple-a<00:01:57.990> batteries<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.070> go<00:01:59.189> ahead<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
triple-a batteries you go ahead and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
triple-a batteries you go ahead and
bring<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> power<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.840> go<00:02:00.930> over<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
bring the power and just to go over the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.539 
bring the power and just to go over the
controls<00:02:01.500> real<00:02:01.680> quick<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
controls real quick I know this is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.770 
controls real quick I know this is
upside-down<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.149> me<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.390> I'll<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.570> kind<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
upside-down for me so I'll be kind of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.620 
upside-down for me so I'll be kind of
hard<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.250> your<00:02:05.280> uh<00:02:05.850> let<00:02:06.600> me

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
hard this right here is your uh let me

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.150 
hard this right here is your uh let me
see<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.079> gonna<00:02:07.229> try<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> move<00:02:07.619> real<00:02:07.829> quick<00:02:07.860> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
see I'm gonna try to move real quick so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.119 
see I'm gonna try to move real quick so
I<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.670> idea<00:02:08.970> okay<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> got<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
I can get the idea okay so I got the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.610 
I can get the idea okay so I got the
orientation<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.629> power<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
orientation here this is power and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
orientation here this is power and
this<00:02:14.370> button<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:14.700> here<00:02:14.790> will<00:02:15.090> always<00:02:15.360> stay

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
this button right here will always stay

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.479 
this button right here will always stay
in<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.690> place<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.170> down<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.280> kind<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
in this place up down all that kind of

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.979 
in this place up down all that kind of
stuff<00:02:17.610> left<00:02:17.940> right<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.599> always<00:02:18.750> goes<00:02:18.959> back

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
stuff left right it always goes back

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.229 
stuff left right it always goes back
here<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:20.010> always<00:02:20.430> sinnard<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.090> can

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
here this is always sinnard but you can

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.089 
here this is always sinnard but you can
leave<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.630> up<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.959> down<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:22.950> your

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
leave it up and down this is your

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.089 
leave it up and down this is your
throttle<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.819> no<00:02:24.209> throttle<00:02:24.739> half<00:02:25.739> throttle

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
throttle so no throttle half throttle

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.900 
throttle so no throttle half throttle
full<00:02:26.700> throttle<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.950> let's<00:02:29.130> say<00:02:29.220> you're<00:02:29.370> at<00:02:29.520> a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
full throttle so let's say you're at a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270 
full throttle so let's say you're at a
quarter<00:02:30.510> throttle<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.080> hovering<00:02:31.500> if

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
quarter throttle and it's hovering if

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160 
quarter throttle and it's hovering if
you<00:02:32.459> move<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.180> left

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
you move it left

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.229 
you move it left
I'll<00:02:34.980> make<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> copyright<00:02:35.790> think<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.120> not

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
I'll make the copyright think it's not

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.120 
I'll make the copyright think it's not
like<00:02:36.360> y'all<00:02:36.630> or<00:02:36.959> whatever<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:37.980> hovering

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
like y'all or whatever so it's hovering

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.640 
like y'all or whatever so it's hovering
and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:38.640> I'll<00:02:38.730> turn<00:02:39.060> left<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.900> where<00:02:40.170> it's

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and then I'll turn left so where it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.309 
and then I'll turn left so where it's
now<00:02:41.040> front<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.720> turn<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.050> right

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
now front this way you turn it right

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.440 
now front this way you turn it right
obviously<00:02:43.860> I'll<00:02:43.950> do<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.190> other<00:02:44.340> way<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.849> then

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
obviously I'll do the other way and then

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.400 
obviously I'll do the other way and then
powering<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.410> down<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:46.890> make<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> land

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
powering it back down will make it land

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.440 
powering it back down will make it land
this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:50.010> direction<00:02:50.640> or<00:02:50.850> your<00:02:51.150> tilt

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
this is your direction or your tilt

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.270 
this is your direction or your tilt
where<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.049> go<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.350> way<00:02:52.410> it's<00:02:52.830> going<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.040> lean

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
where you go this way it's going to lean

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.250 
where you go this way it's going to lean
forward<00:02:53.610> more<00:02:53.640> lean<00:02:54.600> back<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.049> going<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
forward more lean back it's going to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.920 
forward more lean back it's going to
lean<00:02:55.350> back<00:02:55.530> more<00:02:55.670> right<00:02:56.670> left<00:02:57.090> we'll<00:02:57.569> just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
lean back more right left we'll just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.300 
lean back more right left we'll just
make<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> copper<00:02:58.410> lean<00:02:58.709> right<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.190> left

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
make the copper lean right and left

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.130 
make the copper lean right and left
instead<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.640> rotate<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.959> thermal

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
instead of rotate so this is thermal

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.620 
instead of rotate so this is thermal
rotation<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> tilt<00:03:02.849> so

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
rotation this is just the tilt so

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.870 
rotation this is just the tilt so
hopefully<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.200> kind<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.410> cleared<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.709> up

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
hopefully that kind of cleared it up

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.509 
hopefully that kind of cleared it up
this<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.060> your<00:03:06.150> left<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.510> right<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.900> trim<00:03:07.769> this

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
this is your left and right a trim this

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.110 
this is your left and right a trim this
is<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.269> for<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.440> tilt<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
is just for for the tilt of it not the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.710 
is just for for the tilt of it not the
not<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.950> rotation<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.480> your

not the the rotation and this is your

trim for going forward and back to power

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.630 
trim for going forward and back to power
it<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.410> go<00:03:19.620> ahead<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> turn<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.370> here

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
it on you just go ahead and turn on here

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.390 
it on you just go ahead and turn on here
and<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.660> right<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:21.980> I'm<00:03:22.980> going<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.190> try<00:03:23.370> to

and on right here I'm going to try to
adjust<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.660> colors<00:03:25.079> on<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:26.130> video<00:03:26.820> just

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
adjust the the colors on the video just

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.800 
adjust the the colors on the video just
so<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.329> guys<00:03:27.480> could<00:03:27.690> get<00:03:27.810> an<00:03:27.900> idea<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:29.750> on<00:03:30.750> just

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
so you guys could get an idea on on just

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.550 
so you guys could get an idea on on just
how<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.880> nicely<00:03:33.480> display<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.079> colors<00:03:34.350> are

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
how the nicely display the colors are

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.400 
how the nicely display the colors are
think<00:03:34.950> that's<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> little<00:03:35.220> bit<00:03:35.400> better<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.569> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
think that's a little bit better so the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.949 
think that's a little bit better so the
blue<00:03:37.620> lights<00:03:37.890> indicate<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.970> forward

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
blue lights indicate the forward

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.090 
blue lights indicate the forward
orientation<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> red<00:03:41.519> are<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:43.560> rear

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
orientation and the red are the the rear

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.220 
orientation and the red are the the rear
of<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.519> other<00:03:44.850> copter<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.989> when<00:03:46.109> you're

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
of the other copter so when you're

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.620 
of the other copter so when you're
flying<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.590> indoors<00:03:47.220> or<00:03:47.519> at<00:03:47.760> night<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.359> it's

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
flying in indoors or at night you it's

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.330 
flying in indoors or at night you it's
much<00:03:48.870> easier<00:03:49.260> wherever<00:03:49.650> its<00:03:49.829> pointing<00:03:50.130> blue

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
much easier wherever its pointing blue

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.530 
much easier wherever its pointing blue
that's<00:03:50.609> your<00:03:50.790> front<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.269> could<00:03:51.420> lean

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
that's your front so you could lean

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.960 
that's your front so you could lean
forward<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:52.139> or<00:03:52.560> wherever<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.459> very

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
forward that way or wherever so very

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.370 
forward that way or wherever so very
very<00:03:54.090> cool<00:03:54.389> a<00:03:56.690> thing<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:57.959> included

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
very cool a thing that they included

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.360 
very cool a thing that they included
there<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.680> I'm<00:03:58.739> going<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:58.980> turn<00:03:59.069> up<00:03:59.220> the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
there so I'm going to turn up the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.860 
there so I'm going to turn up the
lighting<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.850> little<00:03:59.880> bit<00:04:00.299> again<00:04:01.519> okay<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.870> cool

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
lighting a little bit again okay a cool

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.180 
lighting a little bit again okay a cool
feature<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.200> noticed<00:04:04.560> yesterday<00:04:04.739> when<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.130> was

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
feature I noticed yesterday when I was

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.160 
feature I noticed yesterday when I was
just<00:04:05.370> testing<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.850> thing<00:04:06.060> let<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.959> thing

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
just testing the thing let this thing

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.520 
just testing the thing let this thing
inside<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.900> has<00:04:10.079> basically

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
inside is that it has basically

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.970 
inside is that it has basically
automatic<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.750> tilt<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.230> balance<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.889> out

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
automatic a tilt to balance it out

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.470 
automatic a tilt to balance it out
whenever<00:04:14.250> you're<00:04:14.519> not<00:04:14.639> touching<00:04:14.819> anything<00:04:15.180> so

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
whenever you're not touching anything so

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.090 
whenever you're not touching anything so
just<00:04:16.049> really<00:04:16.380> give<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.799> little<00:04:16.889> bit<00:04:17.039> of

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
just really give it a little bit of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300 
just really give it a little bit of
throttle<00:04:17.220> here<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:19.079> also<00:04:19.380> just<00:04:19.709> just

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
throttle here and it also just just

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.270 
throttle here and it also just just
while<00:04:20.880> just<00:04:21.690> worth<00:04:21.840> mentioning<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.500> sounds

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
while just worth mentioning it sounds

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.440 
while just worth mentioning it sounds
very<00:04:23.460> very<00:04:23.610> cool<00:04:23.909> it<00:04:24.030> sounds<00:04:24.210> like<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.360> little

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
very very cool it sounds like a little

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.470 
very very cool it sounds like a little
mosquito

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
mosquito

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.760 
mosquito
anyway<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:27.990> what<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.140> was<00:04:28.260> talking<00:04:28.410> about<00:04:28.440> so

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
anyway so what I was talking about so

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.830 
anyway so what I was talking about so
where<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.040> blue<00:04:29.220> lights<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.580> forward<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.540> if<00:04:30.690> I

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
where the blue lights is forward so if I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.010 
where the blue lights is forward so if I
turn<00:04:31.470> out<00:04:31.500> here<00:04:31.830> since<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.850> copter<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.450> fairly

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
turn out here since the copter is fairly

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.380 
turn out here since the copter is fairly
balanced<00:04:34.500> all<00:04:34.650> four<00:04:35.070> rotors<00:04:35.340> are<00:04:35.700> all<00:04:36.000> four<00:04:36.210> a

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
balanced all four rotors are all four a

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.360 
balanced all four rotors are all four a
four<00:04:36.630> propellers<00:04:37.050> are<00:04:37.200> spinning<00:04:37.230> when<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.100> lean

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
four propellers are spinning when I lean

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.500 
four propellers are spinning when I lean
it<00:04:38.490> without<00:04:38.700> touching<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.120> controller<00:04:39.390> when

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
it without touching the controller when

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.320 
it without touching the controller when
I<00:04:39.600> lean<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.990> forward<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:41.310> back<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.820> died<00:04:42.090> out

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
I lean it forward the back to died out

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.170 
I lean it forward the back to died out
in<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.840> front<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.290> power<00:04:43.530> up<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:45.030> then

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
in the front to power up so it so then

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.580 
in the front to power up so it so then
it<00:04:45.300> balances<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.780> back<00:04:45.870> out<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.260> I'll<00:04:46.350> push

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
it balances it back out so I'll push

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.350 
it balances it back out so I'll push
this<00:04:46.800> way<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.940> they'll<00:04:48.090> do<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.330> with

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
this way and they'll do it with

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.330 
this way and they'll do it with
individual<00:04:48.930> ones<00:04:49.110> too<00:04:49.260> if<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.470> tilt<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:50.040> this

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
individual ones too if I tilt it this

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.870 
individual ones too if I tilt it this
way

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
way

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.690 
way
it<00:04:51.570> kills<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.590> rotor<00:04:52.800> here<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.370> pushes

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
it kills the the rotor here and pushes

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.720 
it kills the the rotor here and pushes
stronger<00:04:54.180> down<00:04:54.360> here<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.350> then<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:55.920> don't<00:04:56.520> know

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
stronger down here so then I don't know

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.710 
stronger down here so then I don't know
if<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:56.910> could<00:04:57.030> hear<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.330> but<00:04:57.450> if<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.570> just

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
if you could hear it but if you just

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.000 
if you could hear it but if you just
hear<00:04:57.900> it<00:05:02.570> so<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.750> kills<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.260> opposite<00:05:04.650> wants

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
hear it so it kills the opposite wants

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.740 
hear it so it kills the opposite wants
to<00:05:05.100> try<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.340> balance<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.880> back<00:05:06.060> out<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:06.690> a

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
to try to balance it back out so it's a

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.490 
to try to balance it back out so it's a
very<00:05:06.930> very<00:05:07.050> smart<00:05:07.380> system<00:05:09.470> unfortunately<00:05:10.470> I

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
very very smart system unfortunately I

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.690 
very very smart system unfortunately I
don't<00:05:10.560> have<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.740> cameraman<00:05:11.070> so<00:05:11.400> I'm<00:05:11.490> going<00:05:11.640> to

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
don't have a cameraman so I'm going to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.550 
don't have a cameraman so I'm going to
try<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:11.970> get<00:05:12.150> some<00:05:12.270> flight<00:05:12.510> footage<00:05:12.900> with<00:05:13.440> the

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
try to get some flight footage with the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.920 
try to get some flight footage with the
tripod<00:05:13.980> so<00:05:14.430> hopefully<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.180> looks<00:05:15.420> okay<00:05:15.900> but

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
tripod so hopefully it looks okay but

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.090 
tripod so hopefully it looks okay but
we're<00:05:16.350> going<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.500> go<00:05:16.620> ahead<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:16.890> give<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.010> a
