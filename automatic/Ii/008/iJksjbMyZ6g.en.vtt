16<00:00:25.380> iron<00:00:25.800> golems<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.279> eight<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:27.300> quote<00:00:27.449> me

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
on that but I'm pretty sure is something

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.820 
on that but I'm pretty sure is something
something<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.150> range<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> yeah<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> can

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
something in that range and yeah you can

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.170
