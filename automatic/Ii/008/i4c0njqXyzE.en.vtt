I'm complete admirer and just its

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
I'm complete admirer and just its
ability<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> evoke<00:02:06.469> just<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.890> pull<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
ability to evoke just to pull you out of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.600 
ability to evoke just to pull you out of
yourself<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.479> I'd<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.440> can't<00:02:10.800> compare<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
yourself and I'd I can't compare it I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.220 
yourself and I'd I can't compare it I
can't<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.209> describe<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.930> know<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
can't really describe it I know that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.910 
can't really describe it I know that
you'd<00:02:13.349> know

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you'd know

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.910 
you'd know
exactly<00:02:14.400> absolutely<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.930> probably<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
exactly absolutely so it's probably the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.820 
exactly absolutely so it's probably the
most<00:02:17.099> religious<00:02:17.670> experience<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.800> have

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
most religious experience you can have

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.390 
most religious experience you can have
it<00:02:20.730> comes<00:02:21.209> from<00:02:21.360> such<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.680> primeval<00:02:22.680> part<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it comes from such a primeval part of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.690 
it comes from such a primeval part of
who<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.610> are<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:25.890> even<00:02:26.069> scientists

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
who we are that I think even scientists

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.640 
who we are that I think even scientists
are<00:02:26.760> still<00:02:26.940> trying<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.270> work<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:27.750> why<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.319> does

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
are still trying to work out why it does

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
are still trying to work out why it does
what<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.980> does<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.220> us<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.940> group<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.480> notes

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
what it does to us just a group of notes

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.110 
what it does to us just a group of notes

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
you just get to it that you know is the

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.180 
you just get to it that you know is the
sketch<00:04:08.840> already<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.049> your<00:04:10.260> mind<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.920> you're

you put a sketch down on paper all and I

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.779 
you put a sketch down on paper all and I
tend<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.570> see<00:04:18.570> paintings<00:04:18.930> as<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.680> collection<00:04:20.519> of

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
tend to see paintings as a collection of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.629 
tend to see paintings as a collection of
paintings<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:21.900> or<00:04:22.260> and

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
paintings so I or and

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.209 
paintings so I or and
I<00:04:23.759> tend<00:04:24.629> to<00:04:24.719> get<00:04:24.930> into<00:04:25.319> a<00:04:25.349> place<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:28.099> imagine<00:04:29.099> a

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
I tend to get into a place I imagine a

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.480 
I tend to get into a place I imagine a
place<00:04:29.370> or<00:04:29.759> a<00:04:29.789> feeling<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:31.469> stays<00:04:31.860> with<00:04:32.219> me

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
place or a feeling and it stays with me

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.239 
place or a feeling and it stays with me
within<00:04:32.969> the<00:04:33.270> paintings<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.169> it's<00:04:34.800> just<00:04:35.069> being

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:35.249 
within the paintings and it's just being

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.260 
within the paintings and it's just being
able<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.550> translate<00:04:35.879> that<00:04:36.120> were<00:04:36.300> different

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
able to translate that were different

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.580 
able to translate that were different
and<00:04:39.270> thankfully<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.139> visual<00:04:40.560> medium

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590
