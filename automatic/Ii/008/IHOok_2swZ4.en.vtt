second or so and ten plaque again so if
I<00:00:54.809> use<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.199> flash<00:00:55.469> lock<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
I use my flash lock you can see there is

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.819 
I use my flash lock you can see there is
weight<00:00:59.329> here<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.870> no<00:01:01.079> connects<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

something wrong with that as you can see

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
something wrong with that as you can see
every<00:01:14.130> time<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.810> over<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:19.350> this

every time and up over this up do this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
every time and up over this up do this
on<00:01:20.580> poor<00:01:21.030> plug<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:22.920> second<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.750> then

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
on poor plug on for one second and then

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.800 
on poor plug on for one second and then
off<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:26.700> let<00:01:27.450> me<00:01:27.600> take<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.900> power<00:01:28.320> cord<00:01:29.810> power

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
off so let me take that power cord power

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.850 
off so let me take that power cord power
off<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.180> display<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.619> Watts

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
off from the display and so your Watts

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.069 
off from the display and so your Watts
from<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
from it

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.950 
from it
okay<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> back<00:01:38.159> side<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.810> LCD

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
okay this is the back side of the LCD

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
okay this is the back side of the LCD
display<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.570> as<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
display and as you can see here is the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
display and as you can see here is the
conger<00:01:45.090> panel<00:01:45.450> panel<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.610> power<00:01:48.170> where

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
conger panel panel and the power where

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.399 
conger panel panel and the power where
the<00:01:49.380> old<00:01:49.590> powers<00:01:50.070> coming<00:01:50.399> Felicity<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.409> here

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the old powers coming Felicity and here

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.620 
the old powers coming Felicity and here
is<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> inverter<00:01:53.149> for<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.439> backlogs

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
is the inverter for the for the backlogs

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.260 
is the inverter for the for the backlogs
old<00:01:57.630> cutters

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.240 

firstly<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.390> notice<00:02:03.780> these<00:02:03.990> capacitors<00:02:04.740> was

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
firstly I notice these capacitors was

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.030 
firstly I notice these capacitors was
really<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.720> in<00:02:07.080> really<00:02:07.230> bad<00:02:07.380> shape<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.010> I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
really it was in really bad shape so I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.300 
really it was in really bad shape so I
replaced<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.480> but<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.800> wasn't<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
replaced them but that wasn't the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.900 
replaced them but that wasn't the
problem

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.830 

after<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.530> tested<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:17.010> backlight<00:02:17.840> there

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
after that I tested the backlight there

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.790 
after that I tested the backlight there
are<00:02:19.050> fine<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.800> switch<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.640> back<00:02:21.540> side<00:02:21.800> this

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
are fine if I switch this back side this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.530 
are fine if I switch this back side this
well<00:02:23.430> backlight<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:26.000> other<00:02:27.000> side

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
well backlight here and other side

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.040 
well backlight here and other side
around<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.710> like<00:02:29.280> start-up<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.330> this

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
around this like start-up and this

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.590 
around this like start-up and this
doesn't<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.400> problem<00:02:35.820> must<00:02:35.850> be<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.420> this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
doesn't so the problem must be on this

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.920 
doesn't so the problem must be on this
side<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.140> these<00:02:37.800> two<00:02:38.160> sides<00:02:38.400> are<00:02:38.700> identical

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
side and these two sides are identical

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.420 
side and these two sides are identical
and<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:42.390> problem<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and the problem with this is if you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.200 
and the problem with this is if you
measure<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.480> coil<00:02:46.460> here<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.700> coil<00:02:47.940> thing

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
measure this coil here is the coil thing

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.420 
measure this coil here is the coil thing
if<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.170> measure<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.760> other<00:02:50.760> side<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:52.590> it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
if you measure this other side here it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.650 
if you measure this other side here it
shows<00:02:53.700> 500<00:02:54.450> ohms<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:55.020> near<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:57.240> it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
shows 500 ohms or near that and here it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.070 
shows 500 ohms or near that and here it
says<00:02:58.020> nothing<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.550> problem<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.780> coil

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
says nothing so the problem is this coil

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.070 
says nothing so the problem is this coil
have<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.470> program<00:03:02.010> wire<00:03:02.400> inside<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:04.290> case<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
have a program wire inside this case and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.480 
have a program wire inside this case and
we<00:03:07.080> are<00:03:07.170> going<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.410> replace<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
we are going to replace that it is the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.570 
we are going to replace that it is the
program<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.930> new<00:03:10.620> one<00:03:10.860> right<00:03:11.310> here

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
program and I have a new one right here

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.020 
program and I have a new one right here
I<00:03:11.870> ordered<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.110> from<00:03:13.530> ebay<00:03:13.890> cost<00:03:14.550> about<00:03:14.790> five

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
I ordered that from ebay cost about five

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.430 
I ordered that from ebay cost about five
years<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:16.820> let's<00:03:17.820> see<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.840> would<00:03:18.989> say<00:03:19.140> stamp

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
years and let's see we would say stamp

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.420 
years and let's see we would say stamp
and<00:03:20.510> see<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.959> works<00:03:22.700> ten<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.860> now<00:03:25.860> for
