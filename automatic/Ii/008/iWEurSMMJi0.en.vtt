00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so here I'm going to show you the cam

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.769 
so here I'm going to show you the cam
mapper<00:00:02.760> um<00:00:03.090> i<00:00:04.049> created<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.770> button<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.779> open

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
mapper um i created the button so open

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.530 
mapper um i created the button so open
it<00:00:07.040> you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.460> automatically<00:00:09.059> opens

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
it you can see it automatically opens

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.299 
it you can see it automatically opens
your<00:00:09.690> UV<00:00:10.139> editor<00:00:10.380> um<00:00:12.259> if<00:00:13.259> you've<00:00:13.679> closed<00:00:14.160> your

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
your UV editor um if you've closed your

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.420 
your UV editor um if you've closed your
UV<00:00:14.759> editor<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.570> just<00:00:15.980> reopen<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> here

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
UV editor you can just reopen it here

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
UV editor you can just reopen it here
you<00:00:18.210> also<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.779> access<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.320> hypershade<00:00:21.920> two

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you also have access to hypershade two

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560 
you also have access to hypershade two
things<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.939> probably<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.420> when

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
things that you probably need when

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.960 
things that you probably need when
you're<00:00:24.660> mapping<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.970> pretty

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you're mapping so here we have pretty

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
you're mapping so here we have pretty
simple<00:00:30.449> plane<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> piece<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> geometry

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
simple plane with a piece of geometry

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.690 
simple plane with a piece of geometry
cut<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.739> mapper<00:00:35.010> work<00:00:35.340> says

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
cut out so the way can mapper work says

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
cut out so the way can mapper work says
it's<00:00:36.270> based<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.200> you're<00:00:37.410> looking<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it's based on how you're looking at the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.900 
it's based on how you're looking at the
object<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> map<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:39.989> um

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
object is how it's going to map it um

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.510 
object is how it's going to map it um
it's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> little<00:00:42.300> different<00:00:42.570> from<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.280> regular

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it's a little different from the regular

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.639 
it's a little different from the regular
Maya<00:00:45.149> camera<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:48.020> am<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Maya camera so if you do am I can I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.630 
Maya camera so if you do am I can I
create<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.190> based<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:51.800> Craig<00:00:52.800> v's<00:00:53.219> based<00:00:53.489> on

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
create it based on Craig v's based on

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.170 
create it based on Craig v's based on
camera<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:56.160> distorted<00:00:56.820> shape

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
camera you get a this distorted shape

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.920 
camera you get a this distorted shape
right<00:00:59.510> white<00:01:00.510> Kim<00:01:00.840> mapper<00:01:01.170> works<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
right white Kim mapper works is if you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.000 
right white Kim mapper works is if you
map<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.850> then<00:01:06.439> that's<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.890> way<00:01:07.920> maps<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> if

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
map it then that's the way maps it so if

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000 
map it then that's the way maps it so if
you<00:01:11.220> rotate<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> look<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:13.010> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you rotate it and look at this way you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.100 
you rotate it and look at this way you
can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> none<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> cut<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
can see that none of the cut is on the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.070 
can see that none of the cut is on the
left<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.619> text<00:01:20.100> will<00:01:20.220> always<00:01:20.759> be

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740 

the<00:01:25.080> texture<00:01:25.439> will<00:01:25.590> always<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the texture will always be up on on the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
the texture will always be up on on the
viewport<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.369> also<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.060> based<00:01:36.329> on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
viewport so you can it also is based on

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.830 
viewport so you can it also is based on
pixel<00:01:37.259> ratio<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> map<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
pixel ratio so if you want to map this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.800 
pixel ratio so if you want to map this
at<00:01:40.049> 64<00:01:40.710> pixels<00:01:41.540> per<00:01:42.540> meter<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:44.390> we<00:01:45.390> hit<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
at 64 pixels per meter and we hit the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.889 
at 64 pixels per meter and we hit the
cam<00:01:46.049> app<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.500> again<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.970> at

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
cam app or again you can see now it's at

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.359 
cam app or again you can see now it's at
64<00:01:49.680> pixels<00:01:50.100> per<00:01:50.399> meter<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.500> also<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.159> do

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
64 pixels per meter you can also just do

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.969 
64 pixels per meter you can also just do
a<00:01:53.399> quick<00:01:53.700> scale<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> want<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> at<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
a quick scale if you want it at a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
a quick scale if you want it at a
different<00:01:57.110> pixel<00:01:58.110> ratio<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:01.430> 256<00:02:02.430> let<00:02:03.149> me<00:02:03.270> go

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
different pixel ratio so 256 let me go

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.480 
different pixel ratio so 256 let me go
back<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> 128<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:06.680> so

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
back to 128 right so

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.030 
back to 128 right so
that's<00:02:10.390> how<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.720> candelabra<00:02:11.500> works<00:02:12.120> um<00:02:14.040> so

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
that's how the candelabra works um so

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.150 
that's how the candelabra works um so
let's<00:02:15.660> go<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:18.990> we<00:02:19.990> will<00:02:20.290> extrude

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
let's go in here and we will extrude

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.180 
let's go in here and we will extrude
these<00:02:21.400> faces<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:26.350> have<00:02:26.380> something

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
these faces up so now you have something

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.010 
these faces up so now you have something
that<00:02:27.550> looks<00:02:27.580> more<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:29.170> know<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:31.020> so

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
that looks more like you know this so

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.800 
that looks more like you know this so
let's<00:02:32.530> try<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.550> map<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.850> here<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.780> see

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
let's try to map it here so you can see

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.690 
let's try to map it here so you can see
that<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:36.960> it's<00:02:37.960> stretching<00:02:38.440> those<00:02:38.800> UV<00:02:39.310> so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
that it's it's stretching those UV so

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.200 
that it's it's stretching those UV so
what<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.720> do<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:42.370> go<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.850> here<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:45.210> select

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
what we can do is go in here and select

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.620 
what we can do is go in here and select
edges<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:47.170> we<00:02:47.320> want<00:02:47.560> cut<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.330> know<00:02:49.480> we

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
edges that we want cut so we know we

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.050 
edges that we want cut so we know we
want<00:02:49.750> these<00:02:50.050> cut<00:02:50.410> right<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.630> if<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:52.960> map<00:02:53.290> this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
want these cut right so if we map this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.170 
want these cut right so if we map this
you<00:02:55.060> get<00:02:55.210> something<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.790> most

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
you get something like that so it's most

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.870 
you get something like that so it's most
likely<00:02:58.980> because<00:02:59.980> we<00:03:00.580> missed<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.270> couple<00:03:01.750> edges

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
likely because we missed a couple edges

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.250 
likely because we missed a couple edges
so<00:03:03.880> we'll<00:03:04.480> cut<00:03:04.660> those<00:03:04.870> edges<00:03:05.290> too<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:07.260> will

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
so we'll cut those edges too and will

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.100 
so we'll cut those edges too and will
map<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.500> now<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.400> get<00:03:09.790> something<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.420> little

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
map it now you get something a little

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.440 
map it now you get something a little
better<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:13.800> then<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.190> select<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.790> your

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
better so then you can select all your

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.890 
better so then you can select all your
Eevee's<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.140> go<00:03:17.320> do<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:17.770> quick<00:03:18.130> fix<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.900> you

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
Eevee's and go do a quick fix and you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.070 
Eevee's and go do a quick fix and you
can<00:03:20.080> see<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.680> cleaned<00:03:21.400> up<00:03:21.610> your<00:03:22.570> UVs

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
can see that it's cleaned up your UVs

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.180 
can see that it's cleaned up your UVs
but<00:03:23.320> they're<00:03:23.470> not<00:03:23.620> rotated<00:03:24.460> correctly<00:03:26.190> I've

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
but they're not rotated correctly I've

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.660 
but they're not rotated correctly I've
added<00:03:27.550> this<00:03:29.220> function<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:31.560> make<00:03:32.560> your<00:03:33.340> UV

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
added this function to to make your UV

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.760 
added this function to to make your UV
shells<00:03:33.880> horizontal<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:35.110> just<00:03:35.320> select<00:03:35.470> an

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
shells horizontal so you just select an

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.960 
shells horizontal so you just select an
edge<00:03:36.010> or<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.580> select<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.390> bees<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.970> you

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
edge or you select to you bees and you

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.320 
edge or you select to you bees and you
hit<00:03:40.470> line<00:03:41.470> shell<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.040> edge<00:03:43.650> um<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:46.030> now<00:03:46.270> you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
hit line shell to edge um so now you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:57.210 
hit line shell to edge um so now you
have<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:48.990> much<00:03:49.990> cleaner<00:03:50.410> EV<00:03:51.240> layout<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:57.040> can

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
have a much cleaner EV layout so you can

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.940 
have a much cleaner EV layout so you can
also<00:03:58.470> not<00:03:59.470> her<00:04:00.220> face<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:02.230> if<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.590> have<00:04:02.770> these

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
also not her face so if you have these

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.810 
also not her face so if you have these
faces<00:04:03.460> selected<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.800> map<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:07.290> then<00:04:08.820> you

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
faces selected and you map this then you

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.060 
faces selected and you map this then you
have<00:04:10.060> your<00:04:10.330> separate<00:04:10.959> shell<00:04:11.260> here<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:14.530> go<00:04:14.800> in

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
have your separate shell here then go in

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.440 
have your separate shell here then go in
and<00:04:17.669> select

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
and select

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.610 
and select
these<00:04:21.170> top<00:04:21.500> faces<00:04:23.560> actually<00:04:24.560> let's<00:04:26.230> map<00:04:27.230> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
these top faces actually let's map the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:38.790 
these top faces actually let's map the
side<00:04:27.890> faces<00:04:28.490> at<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.790> same<00:04:29.000> time<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:34.190> not<00:04:36.250> that

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
side faces at the same time and not that

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.100 
side faces at the same time and not that
if<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:40.040> want<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.460> map<00:04:40.670> this<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:41.690> part

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
if you want it to map this this part

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.880 
if you want it to map this this part
together<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.490> could<00:04:43.640> just<00:04:44.020> do<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.260> select

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
together you could just do that select

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:55.120 
together you could just do that select
these<00:04:46.250> edges<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:51.340> type<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.730> way<00:04:54.130> and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
these edges and type it that way and

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.270 
these edges and type it that way and
then<00:04:55.610> once<00:04:55.850> again<00:04:56.210> just<00:04:56.920> do<00:04:57.920> a<00:04:57.950> quick<00:04:58.220> fix

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
then once again just do a quick fix

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.910 
then once again just do a quick fix
select<00:05:01.280> an<00:05:01.430> edge<00:05:02.380> make<00:05:03.380> that<00:05:03.590> horizontal

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
select an edge make that horizontal

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.790 
select an edge make that horizontal
again<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.680> then<00:05:06.680> just<00:05:07.400> do<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.580> quick<00:05:07.730> scale

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
again and then just do a quick scale

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.710 
again and then just do a quick scale
then<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:10.220> can<00:05:11.530> use<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.770> regular<00:05:13.190> Maya<00:05:13.720> move

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
then you can use the regular Maya move

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:25.030 
then you can use the regular Maya move
until<00:05:15.140> UV<00:05:15.560> edges<00:05:18.850> like<00:05:19.850> all<00:05:20.270> those<00:05:22.240> so<00:05:24.040> that's

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
until UV edges like all those so that's

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.910 
until UV edges like all those so that's
the<00:05:25.940> can<00:05:26.180> mapper<00:05:27.760> um<00:05:28.930> also<00:05:29.930> when<00:05:30.380> you<00:05:30.500> do<00:05:30.680> the

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
the can mapper um also when you do the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.710 
the can mapper um also when you do the
mapping<00:05:31.160> you<00:05:31.490> can<00:05:31.670> always<00:05:32.000> have<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.210> start<00:05:32.600> at

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
mapping you can always have it start at

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.150 
mapping you can always have it start at
zero<00:05:33.490> which<00:05:34.490> is<00:05:34.600> nice<00:05:35.600> if<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.110> always<00:05:36.290> want<00:05:37.070> it

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
zero which is nice if you always want it

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.270 
zero which is nice if you always want it
to<00:05:37.280> start<00:05:37.520> at<00:05:37.700> zero<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:39.710> can<00:05:39.890> see<00:05:40.070> when<00:05:40.250> I

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
to start at zero so you can see when I

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.230 
to start at zero so you can see when I
map<00:05:40.610> this<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:41.720> will<00:05:41.840> snap<00:05:42.200> the<00:05:42.560> EV<00:05:42.920> show<00:05:43.160> 20<00:05:43.820> if

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
map this it will snap the EV show 20 if

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.280 
map this it will snap the EV show 20 if
you<00:05:44.390> have<00:05:44.600> this<00:05:44.780> turned<00:05:45.080> off<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:46.970> map<00:05:47.240> it

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
you have this turned off and you map it

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.940 
you have this turned off and you map it
it<00:05:48.290> won't<00:05:48.670> fit<00:05:50.200> that's<00:05:51.200> it<00:05:51.470> towards<00:05:51.860> the

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
it won't fit that's it towards the

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:01.450 
it won't fit that's it towards the
center<00:05:54.790> so<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:57.310> is<00:05:58.310> basically<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.950> can<00:06:01.190> map

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
center so that is basically the can map

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.090 
center so that is basically the can map
part
