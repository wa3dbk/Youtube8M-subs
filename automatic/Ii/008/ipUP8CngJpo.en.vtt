guess that kind of counts and piques
your<00:00:56.899> interest<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.559> little<00:00:58.070> bit<00:00:59.829> nicely<00:01:00.829> done

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.490 
I guess that's the end of that so I
guess<00:07:31.330> I'm<00:07:31.480> going<00:07:31.600> to<00:07:31.660> go<00:07:31.780> ahead<00:07:31.900> and<00:07:32.080> cut<00:07:32.320> that

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500
