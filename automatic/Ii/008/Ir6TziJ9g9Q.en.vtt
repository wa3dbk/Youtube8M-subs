to<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.180> property<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.760> as<00:00:08.760> part<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.120> my

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
to this property and as part of my

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.140 
to this property and as part of my
research<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.110> actually<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.860> gone<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.910> done

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
research I actually have gone and done

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.459 
research I actually have gone and done
quite<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> bit<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.570> research<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.080> regards<00:00:13.410> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
quite a bit of research in regards to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.860 
quite a bit of research in regards to
trespassing<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.820> thought<00:00:15.480> maybe<00:00:15.660> I'd

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
trespassing and so I thought maybe I'd

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.380 
trespassing and so I thought maybe I'd
share<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:17.310> all<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.760> maybe<00:00:18.150> help

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
share that with you all and maybe help

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.810 
share that with you all and maybe help
some<00:00:18.510> other<00:00:18.630> people<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> first<00:00:20.640> question

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
some other people so the first question

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.519 
some other people so the first question
is<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.570> why<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:21.930> why<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.439> we

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
is really what why are we why are we

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.109 
is really what why are we why are we
doing<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.820> think<00:00:24.029> it's

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
doing this at all and I think it's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.939 
doing this at all and I think it's
pretty<00:00:24.330> clear<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> most<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.990> us<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.140> we

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
pretty clear to most of us that we

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
pretty clear to most of us that we
should<00:00:26.099> feel<00:00:26.279> safe<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.849> our<00:00:27.000> property<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
should feel safe in our property and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
should feel safe in our property and
especially<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.949> our<00:00:29.070> homes<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.820> our<00:00:29.970> land

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
especially in our homes and on our land

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.280 
especially in our homes and on our land
and<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.539> our<00:00:30.660> farms<00:00:32.510> we<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:33.840> need<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> feel

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and in our farms we really need to feel

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.690 
and in our farms we really need to feel
a<00:00:34.350> say<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.309> any<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.550> we're<00:00:35.640> gonna

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
a say if there's any way we're gonna

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.160 
a say if there's any way we're gonna
feel<00:00:35.940> safe<00:00:36.149> that's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> place<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
feel safe that's the place that it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
feel safe that's the place that it
should<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> even<00:00:38.579> more<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.120> case

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
should be and this is even more the case

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
should be and this is even more the case
for<00:00:39.600> those<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.899> us<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> are<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> rural

possibly trespassing plus possibly
burglary<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.560> adds<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
burglary so that that really adds up the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.920 
burglary so that that really adds up the
charges<00:01:18.470> against<00:01:19.470> criminals<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.750> research

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
charges against criminals so my research

isn't is for Tennessee so other states
are<00:01:24.930> different<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
are different but this but this is just

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.069

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
for people to be safe now in Tennessee

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.050 
for people to be safe now in Tennessee
there's<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.450> defense<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.920> trespasser<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
there's a defense for a trespasser to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.999 
there's a defense for a trespasser to
claim<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.229> thought<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:10.979> had

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
claim that they thought that they had

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.540

want<00:02:24.450> them<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.870> defense<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.920> that's

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
want them to have that defense so that's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.750

why<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:27.060> post<00:02:27.330> signs<00:02:27.920> what<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.310> happens<00:02:29.670> when

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
why we post signs what what happens when

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.090 
why we post signs what what happens when
you<00:02:29.850> post<00:02:30.060> signs<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:31.350> defense<00:02:31.830> is

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
you post signs is that defense is

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.160 
you post signs is that defense is
removed<00:02:32.820> from<00:02:34.070> as<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.160> possible<00:02:35.610> defense<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
removed from as a possible defense the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.880 
removed from as a possible defense the
way<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.500> law<00:02:37.620> reads<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:38.970> says<00:02:39.240> if<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
way the law reads is it says if the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.210 
way the law reads is it says if the
owner<00:02:41.490> post<00:02:42.030> signs<00:02:42.390> at<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.990> major<00:02:43.500> points<00:02:44.100> of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
owner post signs at all major points of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.970 
owner post signs at all major points of
ingress<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.630> an<00:02:45.780> ingress<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.320> an<00:02:46.500> entrance

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
ingress so an ingress is an entrance

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.780 
ingress so an ingress is an entrance
right<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:48.080> that's<00:02:49.080> sort<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.650> not<00:02:50.130> entirely

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
right so that's sort of not entirely

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.000 
right so that's sort of not entirely
clear<00:02:51.270> what<00:02:51.540> an<00:02:51.780> entrance<00:02:52.170> might<00:02:52.860> be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
clear what an entrance might be

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.580 
clear what an entrance might be
considered<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.350> even<00:02:55.560> just

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
considered to be and it's not even just

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.630 
considered to be and it's not even just
any<00:02:55.950> entrance<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.520> major<00:02:56.820> entrance<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.640> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
any entrance it's a major entrance so it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.400 
any entrance it's a major entrance so it
seems<00:02:59.970> pretty<00:03:00.180> clear<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.810> probably

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
seems pretty clear that you probably

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.120 
seems pretty clear that you probably
don't<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.920> worry<00:03:02.040> about<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.650> know<00:03:04.770> every

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.790 
offense now I don't know if you can see
it<00:04:28.919> but<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.159> tree<00:04:29.400> sort<00:04:29.699> of<00:04:29.849> clear<00:04:30.150> up<00:04:30.360> here

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
it but the tree sort of clear up here

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.189 
it but the tree sort of clear up here
and<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:32.280> not<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.580> major<00:04:32.940> point<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.599> ingress

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
and it's not a major point of ingress

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.029 
and it's not a major point of ingress
but<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.610> sort<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.710> possibly<00:04:37.710> might<00:04:37.889> be

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
but it sort of possibly might be

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.070 
but it sort of possibly might be
considered<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.520> way<00:04:38.729> so<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.449> again<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.870> be

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
considered that way so just again to be

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.710 
considered that way so just again to be
extra<00:04:40.560> clear<00:04:40.800> we<00:04:41.669> have<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.880> sign<00:04:42.180> sort<00:04:42.539> of<00:04:42.630> in

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
extra clear we have a sign sort of in

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.390 
extra clear we have a sign sort of in
the<00:04:42.780> back<00:04:42.990> there<00:04:43.289> so<00:04:43.320> that<00:04:43.680> anyone<00:04:43.889> can<00:04:44.039> see

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the back there so that anyone can see

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.370 
the back there so that anyone can see
this<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.919> still<00:04:46.919> no<00:04:47.310> trespassing<00:04:48.090> here

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
this is still no trespassing here

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.640 
this is still no trespassing here
so<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.880> trespassing<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:52.930> bump<00:04:53.200> up<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.410> a
