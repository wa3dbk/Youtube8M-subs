00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:02.170
 a square 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.700
 percent to the general amazement of the crowd that is gathered there 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.720
 as if it were a historical event as if it were a fact that it happened that 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.719
 it happened 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.480
 and therefore this one 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.929
 paint becomes a true evidence 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.509
 aquila in my investigation of this 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.919
 recently until the writing of the great mysteries of the third millennium 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.390
 Mr. Jorge Valderrábano expert in biblical research made us 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.300
 get a photograph of a painting that is displayed in the Vatican 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.550
 where we can see a horse flying 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 Here we will present the analysis of this painting and a fact that could 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.300
 have happened already 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.380
 several centuries 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.330
 Mr. Jorge Valderrábano 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.760
 researcher and expert in biblical subjects did reach the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.710
 resurrection of the great mysteries of the third millennium the photograph of a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.850
 extraordinary painting located in the vatican museum 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.220
 representing a group of people surprised at the appearance in the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.310
 sky of a horse 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.350
 The fact represented in the painting reminded us of the fact that the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.160
 young Italian Antonio Bussi on October 17, 2005 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.380
 where we observe 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.510
 the presence of an equine in the air 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.590
 in the same way as in the work of art 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.630
 perhaps the author of the painting located in the Vatican 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.400
 he wanted to record the event similar to the one lived by antonio ursi 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.390
 the shot of ursi that was seen around the world unleashed a strong polemic 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.870
 However, an exhaustive investigation revealed that the 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.680
 he tried a real event 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.770
 However, when they proved their sorrow, new ones were opened, great unknowns 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.070
 In the opinion of researchers, it could well be some kind of 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 signal 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.000
 when analyzing the painting exhibited in the Vatican we can observe a group of 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.930
 people who react with fear as they look up to the sky and observe the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.370
 irruption of a horse that can 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.249
 We can say this when you appreciate the astonished looks of your friends 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.400
 who were gathered 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.970
 this event may well have happened in the main square of the city of 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.619
 bologna 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.470
 when judging 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.269
 by the column that appears in the scene 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.339
 and that presents in its upper part 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.379
 a representative sculpture this city 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.779
 although curiously more is also found in Italy 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.520
 Apparently the artist tried to represent before this unusual fact 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.810
 and that took by surprise the villagers also chacón with 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.469
 Attention 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.430
 the friar who was directing a sermon to the people at that time 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:36.169
 the friar that we observed in the painting because of his vestments could belong to 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.679
 the order of the Dominicans 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:38.730
 possibly 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.079
 it's about santo domingo de guzmán 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.339
 Kim is noticing to the crowd that it is a signal 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:45.689
 divine 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.109
 the painting is a fresco that due to its characteristics of totality 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.749
 saturation of colors could have been done in the 15th century and according to the 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.969
 detail of its characters for corresponding to the period of 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.219
 early rebirth 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.580
 in the biblical texts we can find various references 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.209
 in the presence of horses who intervene 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.470
 at key moments of the prophets in this particular case for the reasons 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.409
 that we observe in the painting we are seeing a clear representation of 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.199
 apocalypse of san juan 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.260
 in this sense and in accordance with the sacred scriptures 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.359
 the black horse 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.469
 one of the riders of the apocalypse that represents catastrophic events is 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.809
 manifest before the apostle John 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.090
 for exegetes 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.580
 the black horse represents the famine due to causes such as wars 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.329
 drought fires today flood situations 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.619
 at this moment this can be a minister 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.899
 will it be that the horse caught by a cloth us is a signal for 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:43.589
 our generation 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.839
 pour on these new catastrophes 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.719
 remembered other interpretations is camaño can also symbolize the 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.160
 second coming of Christ 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.370
 who came to save us 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.750
 of the evils that our world is suffering at this moment 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.360
 this event registered several centuries ago 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.030
 speaks to us about the possibility that these 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.989
 signs in the sky 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.469
 for the great mysteries of the third millennium 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.439
