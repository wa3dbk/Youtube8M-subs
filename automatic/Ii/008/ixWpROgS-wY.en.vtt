00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.609 
actually pretty freaky to think about
considering<00:02:08.910> how<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.390> Christian<00:02:10.020> music<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
considering how much Christian music is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.330 
considering how much Christian music is
out<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:11.819> I'm

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
out there I'm

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.550 
out there I'm
is<00:02:12.790> there<00:02:13.510> more<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.840> chance<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.379> band

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
is there more of a chance for a band

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.550 
is there more of a chance for a band
like<00:02:14.620> As<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.129> Lay<00:02:15.160> Dying<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.720> tour<00:02:17.110> with<00:02:17.260> bands

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
like As I Lay Dying to tour with bands

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.190 
like As I Lay Dying to tour with bands
who<00:02:17.739> may<00:02:17.890> be<00:02:17.950> faking<00:02:18.580> Christianity<00:02:19.510> maybe

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
who may be faking Christianity maybe

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.930 
who may be faking Christianity maybe
because<00:02:20.830> there<00:02:21.010> are<00:02:21.069> loud<00:02:21.310> rock<00:02:21.610> group

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
because there are loud rock group

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.339 
because there are loud rock group
because<00:02:22.239> there<00:02:22.420> are<00:02:22.480> metal<00:02:22.780> group<00:02:23.050> maybe

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
because there are metal group maybe

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.470 
because there are metal group maybe
that's<00:02:23.590> possible

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that's possible

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.360 
that's possible
is<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.690> also<00:02:25.870> possible<00:02:26.879> because<00:02:29.129> maybe<00:02:30.129> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
is it also possible because maybe the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.860 
is it also possible because maybe the
fact<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.640> they<00:02:30.790> weren't<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:31.209> Christians

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
fact that they weren't really Christians

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.720 
fact that they weren't really Christians
that<00:02:32.140> there<00:02:32.590> were<00:02:32.680> bands<00:02:32.950> who<00:02:33.160> were<00:02:33.190> truly

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
that there were bands who were truly

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.460 
that there were bands who were truly
Christian<00:02:34.390> who<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:34.750> wouldn't<00:02:35.080> fuck<00:02:35.290> with

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
Christian who like wouldn't fuck with

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.839 
Christian who like wouldn't fuck with
that<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.890> maybe<00:02:36.040> weren't<00:02:36.250> calling<00:02:36.610> them<00:02:36.730> out

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
that and maybe weren't calling them out

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.000 
that and maybe weren't calling them out
or<00:02:37.030> anything<00:02:37.239> but<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.290> maybe<00:02:38.590> sort<00:02:38.920> of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
or anything but you know maybe sort of

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.800 
or anything but you know maybe sort of
word<00:02:39.220> travels<00:02:39.790> through<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> grapevine<00:02:40.299> and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
word travels through the grapevine and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.809 
word travels through the grapevine and
there<00:02:40.930> are<00:02:41.080> Christian<00:02:41.980> bands<00:02:42.220> who<00:02:42.430> are<00:02:42.519> really

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
there are Christian bands who are really

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.240 
there are Christian bands who are really
Christian<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.900> sort<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.500> they<00:02:44.650> know<00:02:44.890> behind

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
Christian and sort of they know behind

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.309 
Christian and sort of they know behind
the<00:02:45.370> scenes<00:02:45.700> who<00:02:46.000> isn't<00:02:46.480> really<00:02:46.840> Christian

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
the scenes who isn't really Christian

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.500 
the scenes who isn't really Christian
seems<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.040> there's<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.310> sort<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.849> deep<00:02:49.090> dark

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
seems like there's a sort of deep dark

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.229 
seems like there's a sort of deep dark
underbelly<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.410> fake<00:02:50.950> Christian<00:02:51.610> bands<00:02:51.880> that

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
underbelly of fake Christian bands that

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.890 
underbelly of fake Christian bands that
really<00:02:52.840> should<00:02:53.079> be<00:02:53.230> drug<00:02:53.680> out<00:02:53.940> into<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.390> open

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
really should be drug out into the open

really should be drug out into the open
and<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.769> know<00:02:56.890> should<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.430> freaking<00:02:58.209> admit

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
and you know should just freaking admit

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.390

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
know I do think it's fantastic that if

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.720 
know I do think it's fantastic that if
tin<00:04:01.359> does<00:04:01.690> head<00:04:02.349> back<00:04:02.560> toward<00:04:02.919> Christianity

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
tin does head back toward Christianity

know this this lie this sin but I think

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.150 
know this this lie this sin but I think
in<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:12.010> real<00:04:12.250> world<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:14.230> wouldn't<00:04:14.950> really

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
in the real world I I wouldn't really

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.210 
in the real world I I wouldn't really
you<00:04:15.579> know<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
you know and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.610

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
in the physical world I wouldn't really

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.910 
in the physical world I wouldn't really
see<00:04:19.040> any<00:04:19.430> way<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.269> possibly<00:04:20.900> forgive<00:04:21.590> him<00:04:21.739> or

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
see any way to possibly forgive him or

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.060 
see any way to possibly forgive him or
his<00:04:22.190> bandmates<00:04:23.350> unless<00:04:24.350> they<00:04:24.620> were<00:04:24.680> to

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
his bandmates unless they were to

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.850 
his bandmates unless they were to

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
to be honest I think the only major

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.980 
to be honest I think the only major
lesson<00:04:55.880> that<00:04:56.000> these<00:04:56.180> kids<00:04:56.360> may<00:04:56.600> have<00:04:56.630> gotten

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
lesson that these kids may have gotten

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.750

out<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.170> watching<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.920> sort<00:04:58.040> of<00:04:58.160> seeing

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
out of watching you is sort of seeing

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.550 
out of watching you is sort of seeing
you<00:04:58.940> fall<00:04:59.240> from<00:04:59.480> grace<00:04:59.750> after<00:05:00.230> this<00:05:00.350> really

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
you fall from grace after this really

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.810 
you fall from grace after this really
awful<00:05:00.770> thing<00:05:01.520> happened<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:03.070> truly<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.100> think<00:05:04.640> uh

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
awful thing happened so truly I think uh

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.790
