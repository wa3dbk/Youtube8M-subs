the car with a quarter tank of gas my
gauge<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.730> broken<00:00:11.759> don't<00:00:12.300> go<00:00:12.450> by<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.219> I

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
gauge is broken don't go by that and I

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.370 
gauge is broken don't go by that and I
drove<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.690> car<00:00:15.719> let's<00:00:16.440> turn<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
drove the car let's turn it on here I

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.240 
drove the car let's turn it on here I
drove<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.590> car<00:00:23.840> 253<00:00:24.840> kilometers<00:00:25.350> until<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
drove the car 253 kilometers until the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
drove the car 253 kilometers until the
gas<00:00:26.400> light<00:00:26.730> came<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.599> cat<00:00:27.779> clean<00:00:28.050> in

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
gas light came on with the cat clean in

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.740 
gas light came on with the cat clean in
the<00:00:28.289> car<00:00:28.439> right<00:00:29.220> now<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.179> reason<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the car right now the reason I did this

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.410 
the car right now the reason I did this
is<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.260> had<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.619> PIO<00:00:32.099> 420<00:00:32.880> catalytic

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
is because I had the PIO 420 catalytic

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.440 
is because I had the PIO 420 catalytic
converter<00:00:33.719> failure<00:00:34.280> right<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:36.059> came<00:00:36.210> back<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
converter failure right it came back a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.000 
converter failure right it came back a
whole<00:00:36.690> bunch<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> times<00:00:37.170> after<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> cleared<00:00:37.860> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
whole bunch of times after I cleared it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.459 
whole bunch of times after I cleared it
so<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> knew<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.270> um<00:00:39.570> as

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
so I knew that's what it was right um as

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.690 
so I knew that's what it was right um as
you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.739> tell<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> car<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.370> running<00:00:41.610> pretty

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you can tell the car was running pretty

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
you can tell the car was running pretty
crappy<00:00:42.120> earlier<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.870> runs<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.649> now

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.170 

runs<00:00:47.559> really<00:00:47.920> really<00:00:48.070> super<00:00:48.550> awesome<00:00:48.579> right

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
runs really really super awesome right

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.600 
runs really really super awesome right

part of it is I had to get this car

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.869 
part of it is I had to get this car
emission<00:00:53.739> tested<00:00:54.129> right<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:54.340> had<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.699> get<00:00:54.790> it

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
emission tested right I had to get it

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.579 
emission tested right I had to get it
all<00:00:54.969> emission<00:00:55.329> tested<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:55.960> know<00:00:55.989> government

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
all emission tested you know government

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.869 
all emission tested you know government
stupid<00:00:56.860> regulations<00:00:57.300> drive<00:00:58.300> clean<00:00:58.600> junk<00:00:58.960> um

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879

my hair out because if the car fails the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.700 
my hair out because if the car fails the
emission<00:01:09.940> test<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.509> have<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.690> pay<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:11.110> $200

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
emission test you have to pay a $200

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.160 
emission test you have to pay a $200
diagnosed<00:01:12.190> fee<00:01:12.490> plus<00:01:12.790> whatever<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.869> up<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
fix it and then you get a conditional

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.950 
fix it and then you get a conditional
pass<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.280> results<00:01:21.759> are<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.660> code<00:01:22.810> is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
pass well the results are the code is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.109 
pass well the results are the code is
not<00:01:23.080> come<00:01:23.229> back<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:24.100> car<00:01:24.340> passed<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
not come back the car passed the

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.510 
not come back the car passed the
emissions<00:01:25.600> test<00:01:25.840> with<00:01:26.410> flying<00:01:26.440> colors<00:01:26.860> with

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
emissions test with flying colors with

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.300 
emissions test with flying colors with
the<00:01:27.700> Catalan<00:01:28.240> um<00:01:28.450> if<00:01:29.229> you<00:01:29.410> guys<00:01:29.530> want<00:01:29.860> proof<00:01:30.039> I

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
the Catalan um if you guys want proof I

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.029 
the Catalan um if you guys want proof I
will<00:01:30.429> show<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.179> report<00:01:31.509> um<00:01:31.920> yeah<00:01:32.920> it

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
will show you that report um yeah it

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.100 
will show you that report um yeah it
does<00:01:33.280> cat<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> clean<00:01:33.789> work<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.240> believe<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.899> does

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
does cat a clean work I believe it does

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.389 
does cat a clean work I believe it does
um<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.569> did<00:01:37.569> find<00:01:37.899> out<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.979> cat<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.159> clean

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
um I did find out that the cat a clean

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.710 
um I did find out that the cat a clean
works<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.940> all<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.179> dirty<00:01:40.420> kind<00:01:40.600> of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
works on all the dirty kind of

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.210 
works on all the dirty kind of
converters<00:01:41.080> like<00:01:41.170> super<00:01:41.440> dirty<00:01:41.619> below

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
converters like super dirty below

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.160 
converters like super dirty below
threshold<00:01:42.610> kind<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.179> stuff<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.479> don't<00:01:43.539> know<00:01:43.899> if

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
threshold kind of stuff I don't know if

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.749 
threshold kind of stuff I don't know if
it<00:01:44.289> works<00:01:44.500> if<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.830> converter<00:01:45.190> is<00:01:45.280> physically

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
it works if the converter is physically

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.630 
it works if the converter is physically
broken<00:01:46.179> inside<00:01:46.679> but<00:01:47.679> I<00:01:47.860> honestly<00:01:48.069> think<00:01:48.550> it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
broken inside but I honestly think it's

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.529 
broken inside but I honestly think it's
worth<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:49.090> try<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:51.970> spend<00:01:52.239> that<00:01:52.420> extra

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
worth a try so go and spend that extra

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.029 
worth a try so go and spend that extra
twenty<00:01:52.929> bucks<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.349> it<00:01:53.410> may<00:01:53.590> save<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:54.009> a

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
twenty bucks and it may save you a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.440 
twenty bucks and it may save you a
couple<00:01:54.099> groom<00:01:54.459> the<00:01:54.640> catalytic<00:01:55.060> converter<00:01:55.330> in

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
couple groom the catalytic converter in

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.580 
couple groom the catalytic converter in
