only<00:02:02.440> when<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.590> shine<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:02.860> right<00:02:02.979> at<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.610> light

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
only when I shine it right at the light

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.240 
only when I shine it right at the light
but<00:02:04.750> other<00:02:04.989> than<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.200> it's<00:02:05.440> perfectly<00:02:05.890> clear

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
but other than that it's perfectly clear

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.150 
but other than that it's perfectly clear
as<00:02:06.489> you<00:02:06.640> can<00:02:06.729> see<00:02:06.819> true<00:02:07.119> on<00:02:07.649> eco-drive<00:02:08.649> powers

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
as you can see true on eco-drive powers

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.589 
as you can see true on eco-drive powers
are<00:02:09.310> indicator<00:02:09.759> which<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:09.970> actually<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.420> here

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
are indicator which is actually up here

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.390 
are indicator which is actually up here
in<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.720> top<00:02:10.899> corner<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.860> how<00:02:11.980> much<00:02:12.099> power

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
in the top corner and see how much power

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.470 
in the top corner and see how much power
is<00:02:12.730> left<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:14.080> gets<00:02:14.349> its<00:02:14.530> power<00:02:14.709> from<00:02:14.860> solar<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
is left it gets its power from solar and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.820 
is left it gets its power from solar and
so<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:16.900> actually<00:02:16.989> charged<00:02:17.319> up<00:02:17.440> by<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> Sun

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
so it's actually charged up by the Sun

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.530 
so it's actually charged up by the Sun
or<00:02:17.980> by<00:02:18.129> any<00:02:18.370> lights<00:02:18.670> or<00:02:18.940> spot<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.300> charge<00:02:19.480> a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
or by any lights or spot of charge a

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.600 
or by any lights or spot of charge a
much<00:02:19.840> slower<00:02:20.170> obviously<00:02:20.800> from<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.069> lower<00:02:21.310> light

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
much slower obviously from a lower light

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.339 
much slower obviously from a lower light
source<00:02:21.940> or<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.420> Sun<00:02:22.660> will<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> strongest

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
source or the Sun will be the strongest

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.320 
source or the Sun will be the strongest
light<00:02:23.530> source<00:02:23.800> force<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> correct

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
light source force that is the correct

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.910 
light source force that is the correct
time<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.750> correct<00:02:25.960> date

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
time and correct date

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.130 
time and correct date
surgeon<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:27.820> is<00:02:27.880> pretty<00:02:28.090> accurate

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
surgeon see is pretty accurate

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.360 
surgeon see is pretty accurate
you<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.409> little<00:02:31.500> dial<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.189> bottom

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
you know this little dial on the bottom

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.399 
you know this little dial on the bottom
is<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.790> functions<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.689> functions<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
is the functions and the functions and

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.020 
is the functions and the functions and
this<00:02:34.590> are<00:02:34.890> accessed<00:02:35.430> by<00:02:35.489> pulling<00:02:35.879> out<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
this are accessed by pulling out the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.119 
this are accessed by pulling out the
crown<00:02:36.480> then<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.379> pull<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> crown<00:02:37.860> want

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
crown then you pull out the crown want

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.009 
crown then you pull out the crown want
to<00:02:38.220> stop<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.180> turn<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.599> thing<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
to stop you can turn that thing at the

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.470 
to stop you can turn that thing at the
bottom<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.129> if<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.610> go<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.819> chronograph

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
bottom so if I want to go to chronograph

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
bottom so if I want to go to chronograph
for<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> second<00:02:43.230> okay<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.709> I'm<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.099> to<00:02:44.189> flick

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
for a second okay so I'm going to flick

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.789 
for a second okay so I'm going to flick
it<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:44.579> another<00:02:44.819> one<00:02:45.060> when<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> push<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.409> see

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
it up another one when I push it in see

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.670 
it up another one when I push it in see
this<00:02:47.129> screen<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:48.090> change<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
this screen here a change to the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.259 
this screen here a change to the
countdown<00:02:50.010> timer<00:02:50.190> which<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.730> started<00:02:51.120> by

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
countdown timer which is started by

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.309 
countdown timer which is started by
doing<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:52.159> where<00:02:53.159> she<00:02:53.280> goes<00:02:53.959> as<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.079> can<00:02:55.200> see

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
doing that where she goes as you can see

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.860 
doing that where she goes as you can see
it's<00:02:55.440> measured<00:02:55.739> by<00:02:55.829> hundreds<00:02:56.159> of<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.310> second

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
it's measured by hundreds of a second

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.119 
it's measured by hundreds of a second
and<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.989> resets<00:02:58.409> their<00:02:58.650> department<00:02:59.040> when

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
and that resets their department when

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.610 
and that resets their department when
you<00:02:59.220> pull<00:02:59.370> out<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.609> crown<00:02:59.819> again<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:01.470> can

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
you pull out the crown again you can

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.559 
you pull out the crown again you can
travel<00:03:01.890> around<00:03:02.220> go<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> next<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.390> there's

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
travel around go to the next one there's

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.160 
travel around go to the next one there's
alarm<00:03:03.959> alarm<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:05.299> that<00:03:06.299> one<00:03:06.450> there<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.629> think<00:03:06.900> is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
alarm alarm to that one there I think is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.160 
alarm alarm to that one there I think is
actually<00:03:07.500> timed<00:03:08.129> with<00:03:08.519> just<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.879> time<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:10.079> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
actually timed with just a time then you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.319 
actually timed with just a time then you
have<00:03:10.260> time<00:03:10.530> display<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.159> on<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.280> side<00:03:11.519> then

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
have time display here on the side then

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.720 
have time display here on the side then
you<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.480> date<00:03:12.780> displayed<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.440> side

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
you have date displayed on the side

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.890 
you have date displayed on the side
they've<00:03:14.730> also<00:03:14.879> got<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> timer<00:03:15.420> here<00:03:15.690> that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
they've also got a timer here that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.770 
they've also got a timer here that
counts<00:03:16.049> down<00:03:16.349> from<00:03:16.819> 99<00:03:17.819> seconds<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.389> is<00:03:18.629> in

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
counts down from 99 seconds and is in

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.119 
counts down from 99 seconds and is in
minutes<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:22.349> didn't<00:03:22.590> go<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:22.799> two<00:03:22.889> days

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
minutes and I didn't go back two days

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.670 
minutes and I didn't go back two days
and<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.639> display<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.299> data<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:25.019> shown<00:03:25.290> and

anybody like it's got treated

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.650 
anybody like it's got treated
it's<00:03:31.590> over<00:03:31.799> here<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.129> side<00:03:32.299> does<00:03:33.299> everybody

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
it's over here this side does everybody

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.530 
it's over here this side does everybody
need<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> know<00:03:34.079> they<00:03:34.680> care<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.879> part<00:03:36.150> here

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
need to know they care this part here

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.629 
need to know they care this part here
the<00:03:36.690> bracelet<00:03:37.410> itself<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.069> actually

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
the bracelet itself is actually

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.089 
the bracelet itself is actually
measuring<00:03:38.819> titanium<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:40.290> very<00:03:40.650> very

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
measuring titanium and so it's very very

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.009 
measuring titanium and so it's very very
light<00:03:41.579> even<00:03:42.000> though<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.299> looks<00:03:42.329> like<00:03:42.720> quite<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
light even though it looks like quite a

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.930 
light even though it looks like quite a
substantial<00:03:43.230> watch<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.459> quite<00:03:44.910> a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
substantial watch and it is quite a

substantial watch and it is quite a
splash<00:03:45.180> watch<00:03:45.799> it's<00:03:46.799> got<00:03:46.980> lots<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.370> stuff<00:03:47.519> on

splash watch it's got lots of stuff on
it<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:48.000> me<00:03:48.209> as<00:03:48.419> an<00:03:48.629> opinion<00:03:49.049> on<00:03:49.199> it<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.739> is

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
it for me as an opinion on it I think is

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.430 
it for me as an opinion on it I think is
a<00:03:49.889> little<00:03:50.310> bit<00:03:50.669> too<00:03:50.819> fussy<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.810> little<00:03:52.260> few

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
a little bit too fussy it's a little few

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.330 
a little bit too fussy it's a little few
too<00:03:52.620> many<00:03:52.650> dials

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
too many dials

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.759 
too many dials
it<00:03:53.760> would<00:03:54.030> certainly<00:03:54.419> suit<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.109> pilot<00:03:55.590> or

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
it would certainly suit a pilot or

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.740 
it would certainly suit a pilot or
someone<00:03:56.459> who's<00:03:56.579> into<00:03:57.090> purchasing<00:03:57.510> because

someone who's into purchasing because
lots<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.260> features<00:03:58.560> on<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.829> for<00:03:59.040> piloting<00:03:59.669> as

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
lots of features on it for piloting as

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.819 
lots of features on it for piloting as
it<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.030> but<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.199> there's<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.500> few<00:04:01.680> too<00:04:01.799> many

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
it is but really there's a few too many

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.520 
it is but really there's a few too many
dials<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:03.060> my<00:04:03.269> liking<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.959> make<00:04:04.410> it
