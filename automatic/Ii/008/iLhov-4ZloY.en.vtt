life quite poorly and told her to leave

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.030 
life quite poorly and told her to leave
basically<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:55.110> way<00:03:55.470> when<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.800> sort<00:03:56.010> of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
basically that way when you sort of

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.800 
basically that way when you sort of
saying<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.640> if<00:03:57.420> you're<00:03:57.600> not<00:03:57.690> gonna

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
saying you know if you're not gonna

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.410 
saying you know if you're not gonna
spend<00:03:57.930> your<00:03:58.080> money<00:03:58.200> then<00:03:58.440> get<00:03:58.560> out<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.850> yeah

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
spend your money then get out and yeah

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.270 
spend your money then get out and yeah
so<00:04:00.690> that's<00:04:00.810> really<00:04:01.080> not<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.560> company<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.220> I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
so that's really not a company that I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.130 
so that's really not a company that I
really<00:04:02.640> want<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.269> support<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.900> wanted<00:04:04.050> to

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
really want to support I just wanted to

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.630 
really want to support I just wanted to
put<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.290> out<00:04:04.500> there<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.280> now<00:04:05.580> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
put that out there so you know now the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.710 
put that out there so you know now the
reason<00:04:05.970> why<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.120> asked<00:04:06.239> considering<00:04:06.600> them

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
reason why I asked considering them

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.970 
reason why I asked considering them
there's<00:04:06.930> only<00:04:07.080> one<00:04:07.290> eye<00:04:07.320> shadow<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.769> was

there's only one eye shadow I was

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.539 
there's only one eye shadow I was
considering<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:09.450> almost<00:04:10.049> all<00:04:10.260> my<00:04:10.470> makeup<00:04:11.370> I

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
considering is almost all my makeup I

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.789 
considering is almost all my makeup I
would<00:04:11.610> say<00:04:11.790> 95<00:04:12.209> percent<00:04:12.239> more<00:04:12.900> than<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.200> have

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
would say 95 percent more than that have

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.500 
would say 95 percent more than that have
