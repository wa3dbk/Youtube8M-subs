like a Honda or whatever Yamaha Suzuki
these<00:02:26.800> things<00:02:27.100> would<00:02:27.340> never<00:02:27.550> break<00:02:27.820> I've<00:02:28.450> just

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
these things would never break I've just

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.920 
these things would never break I've just
never<00:02:29.170> seen<00:02:29.970> stuff<00:02:30.970> like<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.360> break<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
never seen stuff like that break on the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.190 
never seen stuff like that break on the
good<00:02:32.110> ATVs<00:02:33.390> another<00:02:34.390> thing<00:02:34.690> too<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
good ATVs another thing too is the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.560 
good ATVs another thing too is the
rubber<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.710> cheaper<00:02:36.190> quality<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:37.090> wears<00:02:37.360> out

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
rubber is a cheaper quality it wears out

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.910 
rubber is a cheaper quality it wears out
way<00:02:37.900> faster<00:02:37.930> than<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.800> good<00:02:38.950> ATV<00:02:40.920> another

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
way faster than a good ATV another

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.980 
way faster than a good ATV another
problem<00:02:42.490> with<00:02:42.610> these<00:02:42.760> machines<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
problem with these machines is that the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.870 
problem with these machines is that the
coils<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.770> electronic<00:02:45.310> component

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
coils and the electronic component

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.110 
coils and the electronic component
components<00:02:46.600> they<00:02:47.590> blow<00:02:47.860> very<00:02:48.280> fairly<00:02:48.820> quickly

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
components they blow very fairly quickly

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.780 
components they blow very fairly quickly
so<00:02:49.450> I've<00:02:49.810> already<00:02:50.050> changed<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.590> coil<00:02:50.980> right

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
so I've already changed this coil right

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.160 
so I've already changed this coil right
here<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.970> recently<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:57.840> another<00:02:58.840> thing

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
here just recently on it another thing

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.650 
here just recently on it another thing
too<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.560> that<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.190> would<00:03:00.730> start<00:03:01.030> one<00:03:01.209> day<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.450> I

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
too is that it would start one day so I

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.410 
too is that it would start one day so I
took<00:03:01.720> off<00:03:02.050> this<00:03:02.260> cover<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:03.090> inside<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
took off this cover and inside the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.600 
took off this cover and inside the
screws<00:03:04.750> had<00:03:05.110> come<00:03:05.380> loose<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.370> pickup

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
screws had come loose and the pickup

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.300 
screws had come loose and the pickup
coil<00:03:06.970> had<00:03:07.209> fallen<00:03:07.510> out<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.830> they<00:03:08.980> don't<00:03:09.010> use

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
coil had fallen out so they don't use

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.430 
coil had fallen out so they don't use
Loctite<00:03:09.910> on<00:03:09.940> their<00:03:10.239> screws<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:10.810> stuff<00:03:11.170> may

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
Loctite on their screws so stuff may

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.040 
Loctite on their screws so stuff may
come<00:03:11.680> loose

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.260 

to<00:03:15.710> think<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.130> what<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> parts<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> lot<00:03:17.150> of

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
to think to what the parts is a lot of

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.230 
to think to what the parts is a lot of
people<00:03:17.600> don't<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:18.020> where<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.230> get<00:03:18.470> them<00:03:19.240> but

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
people don't know where to get them but

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.880 
people don't know where to get them but
a<00:03:20.270> good<00:03:20.510> way<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.690> get<00:03:20.870> parts<00:03:21.200> for<00:03:21.350> these<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.710> on

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
a good way to get parts for these is on

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.390 
a good way to get parts for these is on
eBay

sometimes you got to match up the parts

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.350 
sometimes you got to match up the parts
with<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.650> they<00:03:36.770> look<00:03:36.950> like<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.850> kind<00:03:38.300> of

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.080 

anyways<00:04:43.470> they're<00:04:43.680> not<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.100> bad<00:04:44.370> overall<00:04:44.730> but

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
anyways they're not that bad overall but

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.960 
anyways they're not that bad overall but
they're<00:04:45.300> going<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.540> break<00:04:46.580> they<00:04:47.580> may<00:04:47.760> break

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
they're going to break they may break

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.120 
they're going to break they may break
even<00:04:48.300> within<00:04:48.510> a<00:04:48.660> couple<00:04:48.840> months<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.440> heavy<00:04:49.950> use

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
even within a couple months of heavy use

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.210 
even within a couple months of heavy use
so<00:04:51.000> personally<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:51.930> wouldn't<00:04:52.350> buy<00:04:52.500> one<00:04:52.710> this<00:04:53.010> is

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
so personally I wouldn't buy one this is

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.860 
so personally I wouldn't buy one this is
mine<00:04:53.580> I'm<00:04:53.730> just<00:04:53.940> physical<00:04:54.360> fixing<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.840> for

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
mine I'm just physical fixing it for

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.280 
mine I'm just physical fixing it for
somebody<00:04:56.120> but<00:04:57.120> if<00:04:57.390> I<00:04:57.540> could<00:04:57.720> afford<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:58.170> I

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
somebody but if I could afford it I

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.190 
somebody but if I could afford it I
would<00:04:58.320> definitely<00:04:58.980> buy<00:04:59.160> a<00:04:59.190> name-brand<00:04:59.790> ETV<00:05:00.660> as

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
would definitely buy a name-brand ETV as

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
opposed to a Chinese one

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.920 
opposed to a Chinese one
but<00:05:03.930> that's<00:05:04.110> our<00:05:04.260> decision<00:05:05.570> just<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.600> let<00:05:06.750> you

almost<00:05:19.710> like<00:05:19.920> a<00:05:19.950> rev<00:05:20.250> limiter<00:05:20.670> or<00:05:20.760> something

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
almost like a rev limiter or something

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.040 
almost like a rev limiter or something
and<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:22.260> can<00:05:22.410> go<00:05:22.560> awry<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.540> if<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.750> get<00:05:24.930> that

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
and it can go awry so if you get that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.900 
and it can go awry so if you get that
problem<00:05:25.350> just<00:05:25.680> replace<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.340> box

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
problem just replace the box

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
and it will be fine I'm not saying it's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.430 
and it will be fine I'm not saying it's
not<00:05:29.100> another<00:05:29.460> problem<00:05:29.970> but<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.930> just<00:05:31.110> happened
