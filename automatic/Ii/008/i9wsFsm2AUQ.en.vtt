protects<00:03:49.569> it<00:03:49.780> against<00:03:50.319> people<00:03:51.099> breaking<00:03:51.370> it

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
protects it against people breaking it

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.539 
protects it against people breaking it
but<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.659> still<00:03:52.900> allows<00:03:53.019> them<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.500> use<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.129> ok<00:03:54.489> so

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
but it still allows them to use it ok so

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.300 
but it still allows them to use it ok so
can<00:03:54.700> do<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.909> for<00:03:55.000> both<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.500> there<00:03:56.769> we<00:03:56.829> go<00:03:56.980> so

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
can do that for both and there we go so

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.520 
can do that for both and there we go so
if<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:58.239> can<00:03:58.329> ask<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.569> that's<00:03:58.720> set<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.260> quite
