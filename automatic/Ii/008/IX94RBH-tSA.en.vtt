00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.050 

yeah<00:04:09.000> we<00:04:09.660> had<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> big<00:04:10.140> light<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:10.910> started<00:04:11.910> out

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
yeah we had a big light that started out

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.690 
yeah we had a big light that started out
and<00:04:12.390> moved<00:04:12.720> very<00:04:13.080> quickly<00:04:13.280> north<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.610> south

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and moved very quickly north and south

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.190 
and moved very quickly north and south
and<00:04:15.330> gave<00:04:16.169> us<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.620> very<00:04:17.010> very<00:04:17.280> impressive

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
and gave us this very very impressive

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.580 
and gave us this very very impressive
picture<00:04:19.200> which<00:04:19.410> possibly<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.590> best

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
picture which possibly is the best

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.590 
picture which possibly is the best
picture<00:04:22.980> ever<00:04:23.160> taken<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.820> hairstyle

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
picture ever taken of the hairstyle

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.640 
picture ever taken of the hairstyle
phenomena<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.770> exposure<00:04:26.400> time<00:04:27.050> was<00:04:28.050> 30

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
phenomena the exposure time was 30

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.950 
phenomena the exposure time was 30
seconds<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.970> we<00:04:30.090> see<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.540> hairstyle

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
seconds so we see that the hairstyle

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.510 
seconds so we see that the hairstyle
phenomena<00:04:31.410> moves<00:04:32.100> from<00:04:32.580> starch<00:04:33.510> up<00:04:33.690> here<00:04:33.960> and

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
phenomena moves from starch up here and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.970 
phenomena moves from starch up here and
moves<00:04:35.520> down<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.540> then<00:04:36.690> goes<00:04:36.960> up<00:04:37.410> again<00:04:37.770> here

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
moves down and then goes up again here

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.280 
moves down and then goes up again here
the<00:04:38.480> distance<00:04:39.480> here<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:41.000> approximately

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
the distance here it's approximately

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.710 
the distance here it's approximately
maybe<00:04:43.290> from<00:04:43.710> 10<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.220> 15<00:04:44.700> kilometers<00:04:45.540> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
maybe from 10 to 15 kilometers the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.820 
maybe from 10 to 15 kilometers the
distance<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.770> covered<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:48.830> the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
distance it that is covered and the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.210 
distance it that is covered and the
camera<00:04:50.729> has<00:04:50.940> optical<00:04:51.590> grating<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.740> front<00:04:53.010> of

the lens and this creating make this

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.200 
the lens and this creating make this
optical<00:04:57.360> spectrum<00:04:57.990> here<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:59.760> one<00:04:59.970> thing<00:05:00.150> that

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
optical spectrum here the one thing that

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.350 
optical spectrum here the one thing that
is<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:01.320> surprises<00:05:01.979> us<00:05:02.160> with<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.610> spectrum

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
is the surprises us with this spectrum

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.280 
is the surprises us with this spectrum
is<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.900> it's<00:05:04.190> continuous<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:06.360> colors<00:05:06.870> goes

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
is that it's continuous the colors goes

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.240 
is that it's continuous the colors goes
directly<00:05:08.190> over<00:05:08.790> in<00:05:09.150> over<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.650> other<00:05:10.860> color

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.990 
directly over in over a and other color
here<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.760> we<00:05:12.150> see<00:05:12.390> no<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:13.080> no<00:05:13.560> lines<00:05:14.010> or<00:05:14.550> dots

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.750 
here and we see no the no lines or dots
here<00:05:15.390> which<00:05:15.960> will<00:05:16.500> give<00:05:16.770> us<00:05:16.950> a<00:05:16.979> signal<00:05:17.340> all

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
here which will give us a signal all

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.870 
here which will give us a signal all
that<00:05:18.000> we<00:05:18.150> have<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> gas<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.260> is<00:05:19.440> burning<00:05:19.950> this

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
that we have a gas that is burning this

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.380 
that we have a gas that is burning this
looks<00:05:21.510> like<00:05:22.010> optical<00:05:23.010> spectrum<00:05:23.580> from<00:05:23.729> a<00:05:23.910> solid

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
looks like optical spectrum from a solid

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.180 
looks like optical spectrum from a solid
