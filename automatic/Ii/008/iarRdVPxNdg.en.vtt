I<00:00:27.369> don't<00:00:28.369> like<00:00:28.489> champion<00:00:28.939> plugs<00:00:29.179> I<00:00:30.220> found<00:00:31.220> that

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
I don't like champion plugs I found that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.410 
I don't like champion plugs I found that
the<00:00:32.960> champion<00:00:33.440> plug<00:00:33.739> cross-references<00:00:34.730> 2/3

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
the champion plug cross-references 2/3

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.529 
the champion plug cross-references 2/3
NGK<00:00:36.050> plugs<00:00:37.059> doesn't<00:00:38.059> say<00:00:38.180> what<00:00:38.420> the

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
NGK plugs doesn't say what the

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.040 
NGK plugs doesn't say what the
differences<00:00:38.960> are<00:00:39.109> between<00:00:39.289> the<00:00:39.620> plugs<00:00:41.050> but

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
differences are between the plugs but

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.540 
differences are between the plugs but
like<00:00:42.559> these<00:00:42.829> are<00:00:44.050> CR<00:00:45.050> seventies<00:00:48.399> they<00:00:49.399> don't

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
like these are CR seventies they don't

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.340 
like these are CR seventies they don't
even<00:00:49.640> come<00:00:49.940> with<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.210> cap<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:50.989> just<00:00:51.170> a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
even come with a cap it's just a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.470 
even come with a cap it's just a
threaded<00:00:52.000> clicker<00:00:53.000> style<00:00:55.000> plug<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:58.480> that's

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
threaded clicker style plug and that's

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.170 
threaded clicker style plug and that's
all<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.660> could<00:00:59.780> get<00:01:00.050> at<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:00.980> local<00:01:01.929> parts<00:01:02.929> store

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
all I could get at the local parts store

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:15.370 
all I could get at the local parts store
so<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:05.239> stole<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.689> cap<00:01:05.960> off<00:01:06.200> another<00:01:06.470> plug<00:01:14.380> and

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
so I stole a cap off another plug and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.560 
so I stole a cap off another plug and
use<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.899> fix<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.140> rough<00:01:18.710> idle

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:51.450 

so<00:01:41.900> change<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.260> plug<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:43.420> remove<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.540> seat

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:11.850 

move<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.610> air<00:01:52.760> box<00:02:07.630> grab<00:02:08.630> your<00:02:08.780> tool<00:02:08.960> pouch

toolkit<00:02:16.960> need<00:02:17.960> these<00:02:18.140> two<00:02:18.320> pieces<00:02:22.750> drop<00:02:23.750> two

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
toolkit need these two pieces drop two

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:33.070 
toolkit need these two pieces drop two
bins<00:02:24.290> with<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:25.360> wider<00:02:26.360> end<00:02:27.220> down<00:02:31.810> get<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> seat

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
bins with the wider end down get a seat

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.980 
bins with the wider end down get a seat
on<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.320> plug<00:02:33.530> by<00:02:33.710> hand<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.510> put<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.780> piece

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
on the plug by hand you put this piece

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.640 
on the plug by hand you put this piece
on<00:02:36.170> top<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:41.959> don't<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.380> much

put<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.829> on<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:35.239> wrench<00:03:35.620> because<00:03:36.620> there's<00:03:36.950> a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
put it on the wrench because there's a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.089 
put it on the wrench because there's a
rubber<00:03:37.189> o-ring<00:03:37.670> in<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:39.260> wrench<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.739> don't

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
rubber o-ring in the wrench I don't

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.089 
rubber o-ring in the wrench I don't
think<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.340> camera<00:03:40.519> can<00:03:40.760> see<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:42.739> holds
