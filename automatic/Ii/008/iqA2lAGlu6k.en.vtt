this<00:00:41.820> receiver<00:00:42.210> won't<00:00:42.660> connect<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> an<00:00:43.350> iPad

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this receiver won't connect to an iPad

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.319 
this receiver won't connect to an iPad
so<00:00:43.950> what<00:00:44.070> Baron<00:00:44.399> actually<00:00:44.789> did<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.300> took

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
so what Baron actually did was they took

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.080 
so what Baron actually did was they took
their<00:00:45.690> standard<00:00:46.410> box<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.129> receiving<00:00:47.460> XM

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
their standard box for receiving XM

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
their standard box for receiving XM
radio<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.530> added<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
radio and then they added to it a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
radio and then they added to it a
separate<00:00:51.300> box<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> mobile<00:00:52.379> link

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
separate box which was the mobile link

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.369 
separate box which was the mobile link
with<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> Wi-Fi<00:00:53.460> antenna<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> result<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
with the Wi-Fi antenna the result is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
with the Wi-Fi antenna the result is
kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.770> rat's<00:00:56.160> nest<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.730> cables<00:00:57.239> because

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
kind of a rat's nest of cables because

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
kind of a rat's nest of cables because
you<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:58.620> cables<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you have to have the two cables for the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.930 
you have to have the two cables for the
XM<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.289> GPS<00:01:01.289> for<00:01:01.500> signal<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.609> need

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
XM and the GPS for signal then you need

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
XM and the GPS for signal then you need
the<00:01:03.090> separate<00:01:03.449> box<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> Wi-Fi

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the separate box for the Wi-Fi

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
the separate box for the Wi-Fi
transmitter<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> need<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> connect<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
transmitter then you need to connect the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080 
transmitter then you need to connect the
two<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.630> luckily<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:08.040> XM<00:01:08.640> box<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
two of them luckily the XM box is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
two of them luckily the XM box is
powered<00:01:09.570> off<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> Wi-Fi<00:01:10.530> box<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.340> there's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
powered off of the Wi-Fi box so there's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
powered off of the Wi-Fi box so there's
only<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.270> jack<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> plug<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
only one jack you need to plug into the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.820 
only one jack you need to plug into the
airplane<00:01:14.040> power<00:01:14.280> supply<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.380> stash
