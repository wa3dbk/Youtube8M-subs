nice to be able to look at the finished
product<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.100> say<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:33.550> built<00:00:34.000> that

no end to what sort of project that you
might<00:00:59.289> find<00:00:59.469> yourself<00:00:59.649> working<00:01:00.100> on<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.640> have

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
might find yourself working on to have

might find yourself working on to have
the<00:01:03.969> capability<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:05.159> build<00:01:06.159> anything<00:01:07.150> at<00:01:07.270> all

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
the capability to build anything at all

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.870 
the capability to build anything at all
that<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.990> designer<00:01:08.409> or<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.799> architect<00:01:09.430> can

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
that the designer or the architect can

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:20.790 
that the designer or the architect can
dream<00:01:10.119> up<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.540> put<00:01:10.869> on<00:01:11.020> paper<00:01:11.259> it's<00:01:11.920> limitless

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.040 

I<00:01:20.890> really<00:01:21.670> like<00:01:21.820> making<00:01:21.970> jet<00:01:22.300> boats<00:01:22.480> so<00:01:22.780> I'll

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
I really like making jet boats so I'll

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.050 
I really like making jet boats so I'll
probably<00:01:23.170> stay<00:01:23.950> with<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.310> for<00:01:24.580> a<00:01:24.610> while

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 

whether<00:01:31.020> you're<00:01:31.260> given<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.620> blueprint<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.370> if

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
whether you're given a blueprint or if

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
whether you're given a blueprint or if
you<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.180> told<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:33.690> somebody<00:01:34.110> wants<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
you are told what somebody wants and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.160 
you are told what somebody wants and
then<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.980> have<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.370> us<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.670> yourself

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
then you have to make us up yourself

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.330 
then you have to make us up yourself
that's<00:01:37.170> basically<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> sit<00:01:38.310> down

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that's basically you have to sit down

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
that's basically you have to sit down
and<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.420> some<00:01:39.570> calculations<00:01:40.200> figure<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.620> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and do some calculations figure out the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.500 
and do some calculations figure out the
math<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.190> then<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.760> can<00:01:41.910> go<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> build<00:01:42.300> it

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
math and then you can go and build it

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.360 
math and then you can go and build it
which<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> nice<00:01:43.290> too<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
which is nice too because you know the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.060 
which is nice too because you know the
breakdown<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.680> good<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
breakdown of it you get good at it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.820 
breakdown of it you get good at it
you'll<00:01:47.370> get<00:01:47.520> more<00:01:47.700> faith

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.770 

oh<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:54.430> heard<00:01:54.730> there's<00:01:54.970> lots<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.240> jobs<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.720> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
oh I heard there's lots of jobs in the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.370 
oh I heard there's lots of jobs in the
industry

industry
what's<00:01:56.590> up<00:01:56.740> positions<00:01:57.250> out<00:01:57.400> there<00:01:57.430> for<00:01:57.850> me<00:01:58.030> and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
what's up positions out there for me and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.520 
what's up positions out there for me and
seemed<00:01:58.690> new<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.230> exciting<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:02.140> not<00:02:02.290> every

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
seemed new and exciting it's not every

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.830 
seemed new and exciting it's not every
day<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.740> get<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> lift<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.730> 12-ton<00:02:04.270> beam<00:02:04.540> around

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
day you get to lift a 12-ton beam around

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:19.229 
day you get to lift a 12-ton beam around
the<00:02:05.080> shop

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.489 

um<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.540> guess<00:02:20.659> seeing<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.019> final<00:02:21.170> product

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:21.499 
um I guess seeing the final product

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.470 
um I guess seeing the final product
knowing<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.159> I<00:02:22.189> made<00:02:22.609> something<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.299> can

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
knowing that I made something and I can

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.089 
knowing that I made something and I can
see<00:02:23.719> what<00:02:23.900> I've<00:02:24.019> built<00:02:24.200> during<00:02:24.469> the<00:02:24.590> day<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.980> I

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
see what I've built during the day and I

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.099 
see what I've built during the day and I
see<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.609> I've<00:02:26.150> actually<00:02:26.389> created<00:02:26.900> something

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
see that I've actually created something

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.709 
see that I've actually created something
and<00:02:27.379> made<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:28.069> work<00:02:28.790> part<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.180> machine

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
and made it to work part of the machine

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.770 
and made it to work part of the machine
which<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.109> really<00:02:30.319> cool

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
which is really cool

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.089 
which is really cool
