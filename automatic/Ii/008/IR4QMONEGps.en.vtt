 havana 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.270
 my group is made up of cables 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.200
 martínez catherine valencia and the maná 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.110
 maris and jordi with the bombs 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.720
 is very from the physics group two dictations 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.880
 by doctor harold risk 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.700
 today we come to present you 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.910
 our final delivery of the project on 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.460
 which is responsible for our respect to the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.940
 components of an electric motor 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.940
 branches 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.890
 good first and with hospitalization 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 when we started to develop this 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.190
 project was if we need to use a 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.510
 One -start or 1.50 engine starter 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.120
 we started to defer what will be the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.949
 changes between these two prototypes and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 we saw that the physical principle of the two 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.440
 it was basically the same but that of 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.509
 a motorcycle to be more portable and 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.960
 more economical was much more viable for 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.960
 this project 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.170
 good another one of the questions happens 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.620
 because it did not appear at the beginning 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.400
 project is if we generate a model or 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.450
 if we already buy anything here as such and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.409
 we expose them 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.380
 we see that we did not get better and it 's 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.280
 much more quality have a start already 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.009
 done and exposed for reasons of 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.110
 that this is already an established product 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.380
 this is something that is engineering 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.770
 as such that it is already there and we can 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.709
 arrange the materials and everything that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.329
 all the physical principles better than 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.920
 making a model that we can 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.670
 find on youtube or an experiment already 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 accomplished 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.189
 exactly how the 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.940
 product and not have any complications 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.590
 in the coil armor possibly 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 the connection of the magnets in what 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.849
 we want is to know that they work that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.030
 faults can actually have that 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.730
 we can provide a product 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.880
 It is one of our main sets 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.390
 of parts in our starter 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.930
 basically consists of the axis that maintains 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.730
 the device stable the in coil that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.610
 is the one that generates the electric field that 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.820
 produces the torsion movement 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.640
 the electrical contacts that basically 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.670
 fulfill the function of maintaining the flow 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.670
 electrical through all the winding and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.300
 finally we have the golden one that 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.650
 connects to the internal combustion engine 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.650
 transmitting in the rotation energy 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.550
 the next necessary component for 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.950
 the operation of the engine are the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.370
 magnetic poles then here we can 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.310
 see these are housed within 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.620
 a cylinder which is coupled with the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.299
 winding in this way 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.250
 then here we see the plants 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.010
 Metals join with the poles 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.560
 magnetic another of our main 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.540
 parts in our starter go 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.190
 to be the brushes that are these two 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.549
 small pictures that we can observe 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.840
 here which are embedded in these 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.659
 small pieces attached to a spring the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.310
 Spring function mainly goes to 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:47.110
 be keep the two brushes 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.780
 connected to the electrical contacts of 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.600
 this form 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.270
 which will keep the source attached 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.480
 power dials beret with a 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.360
 rotation movement continues like this 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.150
 same in this part we're going to have a 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.550
 nut that basically keeps 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.890
 secured the connector and it's one of the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.020
 battery terminals which will 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.740
 You can see inside this small 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.500
 floor 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.259
 well here we find the bearing the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.750
 which has two screws 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.720
 keeps the whole system integrated here 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.330
 we can see the bearing of which 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.300
 the shaft rests 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.319
 It has some rubber gaskets which 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.680
 allows to have agents apart 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.680
 external 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.729
 good next with the process 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.509
 Assembly of our starter 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.490
 everything is going to start putting the bearing 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:51.620
 next to the winding in this way 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.590
 we will also put the two doors 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.129
 that will allow a better grip with 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.589
 the complete engine 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.300
 after this we are going to connect the 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:06.190
 cylinder schilling with both and 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.080
 hands to the same and winding 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.080
 which bank perfectly 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.530
 one of the most complicated parts and one 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.629
 of the problems we had at 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.449
 complete engine assembly was that 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:25.419
 the springs allow us access 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:28.690
 direct to assemble then what 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:33.069
 we have to do is put every spring by 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:36.580
 separate and fit in our piece 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:41.009
 complete with the brushes and with your 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.009
 total compartment in this way 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.920
 here we can see that the engine of 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.420
 boot is totally united with 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.430
 our town of the battery 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.700
 and it is simply to adjust the two 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.060
 screws that still on the whole axis of this 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.060
 way 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:24.900
 here we already see our finished start 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:28.169
 connected to a 12-volt battery and 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.849
 a real switch and I send them to the 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.849
 complete system regulation 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.550
 well this is the completion of our 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.410
 project one of the great 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.410
 inconveniences we had was more than 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.020
 all the battery because we use materials 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.480
 from 8 to 12 volts but we did not have 50 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.670
 account the amount of current that 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.890
 he passed the start what the 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.550
 principle did not give us operation 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.000
 exact start 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.730
 the incorporation of the switch 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.840
 it was somewhat complicated since we are 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:11.230
 using the real part of the bike and then 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.710
 it brings several connections but basically 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:17.140
 there were no more problems in the completion 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.139
 of this project I hope it's great 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.159
 utility 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.159
 many thanks
