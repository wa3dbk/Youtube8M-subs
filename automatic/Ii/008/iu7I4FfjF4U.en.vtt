00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.100
 links and 4 2013 more forms and one data is worth 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.620
 and spam or whatever you want I'd better spam 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.050
 It is one of the best and is in Spanish 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.480

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.500
 there are many mods and such 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.930
 I'm going to get in cars for getting in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.170
 good you see the car is the bmw that is 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.780
 really cool that is that flips sticks 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.790
 awesome jumps of crazy you give to 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.790
 mediafire in download that is the best 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.980
 download 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.070
 good to wait 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.150
 until it's downloaded good while 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.780
 is downloading home computer and we 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.160
 let's go to what is my documents once 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.450
 inside my documents we are going to make my 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.619
 game my game inside my game 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 farm and simulator 2013 and within 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.000
 simulator 2013 we are going to mods 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.460
 within here of mods you see that I have a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 bunch of rauch that are a lot of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 mods is worth in here will get the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.810
 mods is already downloaded the bmw show 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.810
 binder 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.170
 already having the mods and the file is worth 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:20.319
 we get inside and we see that everything is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.519
 then mount folders and files 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.400
 yes you have to put it if there is no other 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.830
 form of mods is that already within the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.130
 winrar there is more mod there is more much more 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.020
 as it is more winrar is worth that those 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.130
 windows have to be extracted inside 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.070
 the mod folder 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.400
 but as we see in this way it is not 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.640
 I need to do it and I take the folder from 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.430

 Well, he is already willing and now we 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.599

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.810
 well once inside that we're on 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.920
 game 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.250
 As we are leaving we are already options and 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.660
 we look at mods inside here you can see 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.930
 that there are images of the mountains there 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.870

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.920
 new hobby 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.780
 even so if you have a game and started 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.540
 It does not matter that the boats do not 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.549

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.590

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.610
 and so far the vehicle is already here 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.610
 cool car 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.680
 good 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:27.840
 and as we see that the car works 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.550
 well I know very well which strips already or not 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.370
 once you have that is very slow in 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.370
 throw to the sea let's say peace here 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.170

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.690
 and to spin as they had done 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.139
 you beat some impressive laps but 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.990
 that flipas looks at snow that was until 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.040
 at some point you get hooked 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.900

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.590

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.820
 very well 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.750
 and the last way to put mods is worth 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.590
 say to download mods 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.740
 at the same time everything 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.950

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.979

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.090
 and it is downloaded 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.270
 and this is the way to excel the most 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.760
 easy of all 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.990
 well once it's downloaded we're going 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.990
 to see if it is already downloaded 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.790
 once downloaded you give to execute 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.750
 OK 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.520
