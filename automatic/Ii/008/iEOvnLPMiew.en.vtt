00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 this is how everything has been 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.960
 discovery has been well entertained 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.720
 because I am a person who uses many 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.109
 colors before I did not worry about that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 the length of this length with another long 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.790
 intermediate could look good or bad 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 true this occasion as a theme a theme 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
 for good so far I always 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.129
 worry that the colors will combine 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 although there would be a lot that will combine 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 all in the same light but now it has been 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 a whole change has been front in a being 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.520
 tobacco break break about learning to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.210
 be listening funny and more 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.210
 well playful 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.550
 number 1 which you can use daily and 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:10.320
 refreshing in other content 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.020
 winters is how I use it because it takes a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 little color and I like many colors 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 of green that always looks great to me 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.380
 Skin tone in this look is a bit more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.830
 author to dress new like to do 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.800
 as much 3 500 with votes that are warm 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 for the winter and they are comfortable and that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.050
 do not cool your feet with 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 slippers this is my number 2 light and I 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.700
 identify because they have many colors 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.729
 and what I was talking about a while ago 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.080
 colors is that they have the same light and that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.300
 is what I like to me rescue 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.000
 when I dress with colors the light of 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.750
 the colors and this look would use it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.060
 especially I do not know to go to the theater 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.149
 for 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.670
 go out to some event that is a bit more 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.880
 because friends with friends without 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.700
 feel comfortable if you paint topics this is 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.280
 my look number 3 is more at night where 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.720
 it's a little more I do not want more daring 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 to come out to isolate when a nation 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.119
 want tonight and said go out and play 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.730
 I take care of my body doing activity 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.610
 physical because for me it is impossible to do 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.370
 diets I really like to eat therefore 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.380
 I think the best way to burn or 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.799
 maintain the body and exercise 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.980
 I go jogging or I do tx I take care of my body 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.989
 wearing good sports clothes because that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.600
 help the release of toxins 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.819
 it is working that it does not 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
 hold down that they are good 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.270
 sneakers to run well if 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.270
 he wants to injure his ankle 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.220
 and that lined it with my paste and everything 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.320
 what I do during the day this is my 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.840
 number 4 and the one that I think should not 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.420
 missing in any closet that is had 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.130
 sporty 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.420
 I think you do not have to do sports to 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.790
 to be skinnier but to do the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 sport so that your body is healthy that 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.530
 is the most important thing in this case I'm 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.900
 using some legs that are very comfortable 2 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.330
 a good cut to wind to go out to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.360
 jog because it gives you heat and this 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.959
 maintains a body temperature this 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.130
 It's my fifth look and it's a look that I 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.350
 I think it can be used for both 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.110
 Sometimes day or night is a little more 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.940
 winter warm is warm and in 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.260
 use a little bit of heel always to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.580
 lengthen the legs that are very 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.010
 important and especially with some 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.519
 clear pants that we who 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.780
 we have wide cookies it 's important 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.250
 use a little bit of tacos to make us 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.110
 see the longer legs and make it a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.049
 little bit more activists but it's a look 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.540
 for both occasions day or night 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.299
 because it does not have as much brightness and it's not so 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.530
 striking and is not so sober either 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.150
 that nothing can be the combination 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.370
 perfect of those days that you have to 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.959
 leave your house early and then 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.370
 you have to run all day and after 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.350
 in the afternoon is that eating I had a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.680
 I eat you a snack with your 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.680
 friends 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.800
 Y
