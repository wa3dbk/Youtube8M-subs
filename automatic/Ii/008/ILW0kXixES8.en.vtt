00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 welcome to a new explanation vodcast 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.430
 on the subject water next to the exam 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.080
 climate in population in space becomes this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.519
 tested for the exam 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.189
 subject worth consist of three 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 chapters we are at chapter 2 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.849
 paragraph 2 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.430
 of which we are going to watch the battle 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.350
 against the water which is always in the Netherlands 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 fed is true in the netherlands it ensures 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 for nuisance 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.110
 how do the netherlands protect themselves from much 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.629
 water and what issues 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.920
 water shortages 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.920
 therefore looked at in this section 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 flooding in the netherlands and and watch 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.320
 to the river country 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.579
 you see below you see one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.289
 cross section of a river landscape 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.580
 how it used to be without dikes 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.369
 so you have the river and that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.479
 flooding often without 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.689
 protection 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.520
 was also deposited from clay and sand and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.360
 therefore you get an increase in it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 landscape 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 near the river where the river beach 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.500
 where the bank of the bank there is a lot of sand and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.659
 clay is laid 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.799
 sander klein is coming for storage 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 from past opens the Rhine and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.270
 flow it a bit slowly 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 away it that sank down to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 the bottom and it is raised at 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.560
 flooding 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.579
 and the banks alongside it will also be 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.979
 the rest of the country is in series 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.200
 mutation deposited and that happens in the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.049
 land so the bank of the river 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.020
 is already somewhat higher than all deposits 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.030
 than the surrounding countries 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.329
 hence the bowl 100 in kind of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.340
 bowl that you are in 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.560
 so that is part of flooding 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.060
 sedimentation 9-series mutation is it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.270
 lay down sand clay gravel and other 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.270
 rock 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.830
 but because the population tended to rise 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.069
 more often live by the rivers because of that 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.650
 provides a fertile place for washing 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.730
 enough water you could with the legs you could 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.440
 do a trade what one needs 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.480
 to protect themselves and that reminded me 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.549
 river dikes 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.510
 and in the Netherlands see following you 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.370
 sees the summer dike that its dikes that 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.799
 small, and enough for the summer 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.569
 and you see it with the winter dikes and 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.079
 those are the dike that you have high enough 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.180
 even when the water runs out 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:57.120
 maximum is that this dike in principle 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.290
 to provide adequate protection 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.190
 bowl soils 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.200
 those are the cars where the mentioned and me 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.910
 from where the then you will be in the summer 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.069
 you will be quite the party there for free 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.620
 21 can be him and so that it 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.840
 is largely under water than if you 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.540
 will look inside the dike and 7 will not 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.169
 confusing because within the dikes will 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.290
 say to it 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:24.480
 from where people live there you look 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.780
 so inside the dikes 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.910
 is not in between the two winter dike 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.250
 but is the right outside in the area 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.280
 what is not flooded 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.380
 that is inside the dike and there you also 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.269
 overflow areas and those 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.590
 they use overflow areas 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.720
 to actually prevent emergencies 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.280
 Imagine that the water is so high 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.440
 that the winter dike can no longer hold 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.639
 then certain overflow areas 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.530
 designated 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.319
 often where few people live then 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.220
 to run under water so that 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.730
 important cities 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.419
 then don't bother so its in 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.120
 times of need 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:10.530
 may this overflow other fight against 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.239
 talking is through pol so everything 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.480
 what a battle for it was under water 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.250
 and b it's a struggle because we got it now 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.829
 round poll or have tried and I 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.470
 means that you have taken away your water 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.530
 normally make 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.870
 are he the polders they have of course 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.370
 used for farming for more land 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.610
 actually something very special and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.110
 that it has been around for hundreds of years 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.130
 That is why the Netherlands is also called waterland 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.610
 called 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.810
 we make a country and you do that as 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.690
 follows 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.700
 you build a time, or at least 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.200
 that is concern that the area becomes 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.050
 delimited 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.110
 then you set up a pumping station and 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.530
 then add a live and then you will pump 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.950
 the water from the polder 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.080
 earth how the water from the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.090
 polder removes 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.230
 goes to the bush and goes on and on 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.160
 removed 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.010
 really musÃ©e or 19 other lakes and then love 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.140
 so you have a dry area all over 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:20.810
 Flevoland is built in this way and 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:23.660
 quite a bit more get me more and more polders 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.460
 originated in the Netherlands and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.010
 actually create with it 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.940
 a lot of land and it is also 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.419
 fertile the clay soil care and follow 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.060
 follow 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.140
 fertile soil this has the Netherlands 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.140
 had much benefit from it 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.830
 but there is also one side too many but 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.870
 on the other hand, a shortage of water 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.080
 and when it is dry one must 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.460
 for example, use irrigation water and 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.890
 This is possible, for example, for salinisation 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.600
 try to care in the dune area 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.640
 explain how that works 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.370
 if you look at the the yellow bar is in 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.340
 the red bars then you see both in 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.660
 spring as the summer that from 2002 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.600
 just stand out 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.030
 up that I lack in the spring 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.620
 if there is a shortage of water in the summer 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.180
 winter is not the case then it rains 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.580
 the enough mine for you is there 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.979
 a shortage 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.419
 a shortage means water because 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.889
 you have that is not enough then 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.139
 you must do it from keeper you must not 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:24.669
 go pick it up 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:27.310
 next to this card and explanation 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.460
 the red water is salty and the blue 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.889
 water is sweet and it is sweet water 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.139
 thats what you put on allowing you to 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.490
 let them pump up too much from them 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.560
 said come from the sea 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.240
 Drinking would drink the groundwater 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.659
 actually land within 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.520
 you saw that heavy to happen here 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.440
 making you so the water would go into 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.759
 instead of fresh water and thereby get it 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.379
 your salinization 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.750
 And then the soil is salt then it grew 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:54.810
 in the plants and so you have one 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.810
 issue 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.979
 so look at where the netherlands where 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.659
 the Netherlands was supplied with water 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.000
 from low areas 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.069
 how do the netherlands protect you then you have 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.659
 it over 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:12.129
 dike in polder and when you go 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:13.960
 see what the problems are 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:15.759
 water shortage in with him 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.409
 despite that an area is what the Netherlands 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.300
 a country is often a chance under water 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.279
 are really not necessarily you too 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.020
 areas that are deficient and too 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:27.969
 shorten can cause salinization this 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.310
 as paragraph 2 print two dutch 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:33.339
 fight against the water 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.710
