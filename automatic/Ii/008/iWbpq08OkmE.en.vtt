one<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> things<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:03.470> look<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.549> one

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
one of the things that we look for one

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.920 
one of the things that we look for one
of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> best<00:01:05.909> candidates<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.479> these

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
of the best candidates for these

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
of the best candidates for these
treatments<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.740> lighter<00:01:08.310> skin<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> darker

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
treatments are lighter skin and darker

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.370 
treatments are lighter skin and darker
hair<00:01:09.390> follicle<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:11.720> whole<00:01:12.720> method<00:01:13.200> behind

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
hair follicle the whole method behind

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.570 
hair follicle the whole method behind
this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:15.320> high<00:01:16.320> intense<00:01:16.979> pulse<00:01:17.340> light

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
this is the high intense pulse light

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
this is the high intense pulse light
which<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.479> using<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> made

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
which is what we're using this is made

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
which is what we're using this is made
by<00:01:19.650> palomar<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:21.090> intense<00:01:21.450> pulse<00:01:21.750> light<00:01:22.020> seeks

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
by palomar the intense pulse light seeks

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.969 
by palomar the intense pulse light seeks
out<00:01:22.860> pigment<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.180> goal<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.979> damage

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
out pigment so your goal is to damage

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
out pigment so your goal is to damage
the<00:01:26.159> hair<00:01:26.189> follicle<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.150> has<00:01:27.390> pigment<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the hair follicle which has pigment and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.609 
the hair follicle which has pigment and
spare<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> surrounding<00:01:29.640> skin<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.299> how<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.350> do

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
spare the surrounding skin and how we do

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.550 
spare the surrounding skin and how we do
that<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.780> have<00:01:33.780> her<00:01:34.020> fill<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that is we have her fill out a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
that is we have her fill out a
questionnaire<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.610> called<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> Fitzpatrick

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
questionnaire it's called a Fitzpatrick

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
questionnaire it's called a Fitzpatrick
scale<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.560> gives<00:01:37.799> us<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.189> guideline<00:01:38.490> at

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
scale and that gives us a guideline at

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.440 
scale and that gives us a guideline at
what<00:01:39.420> energy<00:01:40.320> level<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.520> her<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
what energy level to use on her and the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
what energy level to use on her and the
depth<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.869> penetration<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> light<00:01:44.100> each

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
depth of penetration of the light each

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.980 
depth of penetration of the light each
light<00:01:44.790> has<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> different<00:01:45.570> depth<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
light has a different depth of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.620 
light has a different depth of
penetration<00:01:46.229> or<00:01:46.979> she<00:01:47.670> has<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> little<00:01:48.210> darker

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
penetration or she has a little darker

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.740 
penetration or she has a little darker
skin<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.950> use<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.610> frequency<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> light

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
skin we want to use a frequency of light

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
skin we want to use a frequency of light
that<00:01:52.229> seeks<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> pigment<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.490> little

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that seeks out the pigment a little

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
that seeks out the pigment a little
lower<00:01:54.060> under<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> skin<00:01:54.990> where<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.259> hair

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
lower under the skin where the hair

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.429 
lower under the skin where the hair
follicle<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.250> rather<00:01:56.610> than<00:01:57.060> her<00:01:57.840> service

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
follicle is rather than her service

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.149 
follicle is rather than her service
pigment<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> her<00:01:59.310> skin<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.290> had<00:02:01.829> her<00:02:01.979> fill

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
pigment of her skin so I had her fill

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.219 
pigment of her skin so I had her fill
out<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.340> Fitzpatrick<00:02:02.700> scale<00:02:03.360> she<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.990> it's

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
out a Fitzpatrick scale she is if it's

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.180 
out a Fitzpatrick scale she is if it's
patrick<00:02:04.799> 3<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.590> we're<00:02:07.740> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.920> treat

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
patrick 3 and so we're going to treat

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.020 
patrick 3 and so we're going to treat
her<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> right

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
her with the right

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.180 
her with the right
head<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.600> once<00:02:10.319> again<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.770> goes<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> little

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
head and once again it goes a little

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
head and once again it goes a little
deeper<00:02:11.430> into<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.030> skin<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.810> damage<00:02:13.319> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
deeper into the skin to damage that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:38.190 
deeper into the skin to damage that
follicle
