 abraham pÃ©rez 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.650
 add a music our project 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 and for that, let's see click on this choir 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.249
 when a window opens 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.130
 directly related to our management 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.259
 so that we can navigate through the different folders 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.829
 until you find the desired song 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.720
 in this case authorizes us for example this 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.609
 the obstacles to the project 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.449
 i 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.590
 as part of the study 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.020
 is that it is going to be applied 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.190
 the whole project 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.790
 i others 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 We can not place at any time 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.600
 said song 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.380
 shorten guadarrama 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.380
 but we're not going to be like this but we're going to apply to the pointer 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 thus 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.860
 we can observe the finished song a brusque form 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.950
 with sao paulo we want 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.480
 so we're going adams 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.930
 adital not 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 with the button 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.690
 audio broadcast 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.130
 author settings 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.910
 we are going to set aside an exit fade 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.410
 so that the song senad sounds more its having at the end 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 everything went wrong 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.960
 and the nation 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.920
 of the folio 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.770
 one with seven seconds 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620
 let's go out 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 and at the end of the song fearful 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 so it happened to him 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 Conversely 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.350
 mountain and sound effects 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.350
 that come 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.380
 in two folders 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 will include severe and very 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.239
 two very complete folders 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 where you will not find any other type of sound effects 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.429
 we can select any of these sound effects 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.509
 and add them to our project 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.509
 the same way as if it were a song 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 pulpit 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.809
 he also reported changing 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.189
 the volume of employment 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.609
 any outdoor track 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.899
 with the engine you edition 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.219
 fit on the plane 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.849
 and the volume 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.849
 Aztec song sounded weaker 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.319
 and that the ground effect 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.409
 sounds loud 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.669
 tie 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.679
 of the total 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.130
 another one in which our idea inmuvi 0 9 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.130
 the possibility of adding could not ever 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.509
 for this we must click on the button 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.979
 and then it is what explains a menu in which few hundreds type of map 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.419
 wanted 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.169
 cc oo any 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.169
 we drag it two tenths 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.259
 incised an inspector will open us 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.259
 from where we can change valuation 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.759
 the effect directed 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.129
 with recognizing that the map 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.879
 look older 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.769
 it will be black and white 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.809
 in negative effect 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.089
 turned around 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.679
 Little lasted his captivity 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.679
 and by how to select the initial physical location 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:04.399
 and then and destination 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.369
 after the dynamo leave 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.089
 and it only remains to see 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.089
 how is said map 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.610
 if you or nobody asks us what we are going to turn into a movie 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.240
 what we have to do is select the share option 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.059
 in the top menu 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:30.870
 i export movie 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.139
 convincing answer 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.199
 because of white karzai 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.620
 if we select the report as vincent option 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.919
 a window was opened and we can change the name of our project 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.669
 and select what exactly 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.259
 the obligation of the video 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.259
 where we do not want to embroider 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.039
 we can also 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.330
 change format 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.469
 3g 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.349
 fcc 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.889
 we do not find out otherwise wait percent 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.779
 if we select the option to export film 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.860
 what we hear is a window like this one where we can also 

00:05:15.859 --> 00:05:17.169
 rename 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.409
 exact location 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.469
 and the size or final 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.370
 what we want for the Sevillians 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.620
 they have related to the great villalante quality 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.629
 karina of the mobile 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.400
 little minimal help 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.100
 We can also see the devices with which our 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.100
 children when it was fulfilled 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.589
 we select any 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:42.199
 and export
