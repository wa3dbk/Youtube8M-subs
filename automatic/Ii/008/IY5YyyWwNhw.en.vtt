hydras to hold a mole sentry I kind of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.709 
hydras to hold a mole sentry I kind of
assumed<00:00:29.279> it'll<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.820> bad<00:00:30.029> because<00:00:30.500> loll<00:00:31.500> hydras

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
assumed it'll be bad because loll hydras

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
assumed it'll be bad because loll hydras
but<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.840> always<00:00:33.960> easy<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> shrug<00:00:34.920> off<00:00:35.390> theory

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
but it's always easy to shrug off theory

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
but it's always easy to shrug off theory
without<00:00:36.540> actually<00:00:37.140> trying<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> decided

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
without actually trying it so I decided

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.220 
without actually trying it so I decided
to<00:00:38.910> try<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.300> out<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.809> been<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.079> pretty

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to try it out and it's been going pretty

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.799 
to try it out and it's been going pretty
well<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:41.640> other<00:00:41.820> thing<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.090> tempted<00:00:42.540> me<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
well one other thing that tempted me to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
well one other thing that tempted me to
try<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> month<00:00:44.910> ago

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that was stopping me from trying this is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
that was stopping me from trying this is
that<00:00:58.530> after<00:00:58.710> holding<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> mole<00:00:59.579> center<00:01:00.000> with

that after holding in a mole center with

since<00:01:50.790> doing<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.240> build<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
since doing this build is that I get a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
since doing this build is that I get a
lot<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.350> creeped<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.009> early<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:54.030> main<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
lot more creeped out early my main is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
lot more creeped out early my main is
connected<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> three<00:01:56.250> tumors

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
connected to my not and three tumors

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
connected to my not and three tumors
push<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.570> third<00:01:58.020> which<00:01:58.920> allows

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
push out from my third which allows

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.620 
push out from my third which allows
Queens<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> move<00:01:59.880> around<00:01:59.969> freely<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> my

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
Queens to move around freely and my

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
Queens to move around freely and my
hydras<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.200> move<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.469> swiftly<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.100> well<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
hydras to move out swiftly as well I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.940 
hydras to move out swiftly as well I
managed<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.659> change<00:02:03.930> my<00:02:04.200> build<00:02:04.439> without<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
managed to change my build without it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.310 
managed to change my build without it
hindering<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.520> macro<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.899> thing<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
hindering my macro one thing that I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320 
hindering my macro one thing that I
found<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.369> Queens<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.090> Four

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
found out is that for Queens the Four

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.639 
found out is that for Queens the Four
Queens<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.140> helped<00:02:10.470> out

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
Queens that you will have helped out

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.250 
Queens that you will have helped out
pretty<00:02:11.069> massively<00:02:11.610> against<00:02:12.450> animals<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
pretty massively against animals and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.979 
pretty massively against animals and
so<00:02:14.069> when<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.700> big<00:02:14.879> engage<00:02:15.299> actually<00:02:15.750> comes

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
so when the big engage actually comes

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.050 
so when the big engage actually comes
having<00:02:16.379> all<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.769> bases<00:02:17.280> connected<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.909> move

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
having all the bases connected to move

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.000 
having all the bases connected to move
the<00:02:18.209> Queen's<00:02:18.450> down<00:02:18.689> is<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.200> nice<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.650> also

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the Queen's down is really nice I also

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.589 
the Queen's down is really nice I also
build<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.430> massive<00:02:20.670> amount<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> Ling's<00:02:21.420> when

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
build a massive amount of Ling's when

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.839 
build a massive amount of Ling's when
doing<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.989> somewhere<00:02:22.439> between<00:02:22.590> 60<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> 70

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
doing this somewhere between 60 to 70

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.880 
doing this somewhere between 60 to 70
before<00:02:24.209> starting<00:02:24.659> Hydra<00:02:25.049> production<00:02:25.439> this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
before starting Hydra production this

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.530 
before starting Hydra production this
allows<00:02:26.129> me<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.310> pay<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.730> army<00:02:27.030> around<00:02:27.180> poke

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
allows me to pay the army around poke

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.449 
allows me to pay the army around poke
the<00:02:27.689> front<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.470> what<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> noticed<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.129> when<00:02:29.310> you

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the front and what I noticed is when you

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.009 
the front and what I noticed is when you
punk<00:02:29.760> poke<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.209> front<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.569> Ling's<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
punk poke the front with Ling's it

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.530 
punk poke the front with Ling's it
forces<00:02:31.560> them<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.760> start<00:02:33.150> pushing

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
forces them to really start pushing

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
forces them to really start pushing
really<00:02:33.750> hard<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.950> know<00:02:35.069> they've<00:02:35.519> got

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
really hard because you know they've got

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.770 
really hard because you know they've got
wings<00:02:35.879> at<00:02:36.030> their<00:02:36.120> form<00:02:36.269> they<00:02:36.420> need<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.690> do

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
wings at their form they need to do

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.890 
wings at their form they need to do
something<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.640> its<00:02:38.819> forces<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.569> pushing

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
something so its forces and pushing

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.089 
something so its forces and pushing
really<00:02:40.049> hard<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.379> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.590> see<00:02:40.739> there's<00:02:40.950> not

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
really hard as you can see there's not

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.679 
really hard as you can see there's not
actually<00:02:41.220> many<00:02:41.549> hybrids<00:02:42.030> out<00:02:42.120> when<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:42.450> hits

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
actually many hybrids out when this hits

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.089 
actually many hybrids out when this hits
but<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.900> Ling's<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.439> manage<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> get<00:02:43.920> back

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
but the Ling's do manage to get back

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.039 
but the Ling's do manage to get back
home<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.370> time<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.390> pointless<00:02:45.690> whim<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
home in time and it's pointless whim to

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.110 
home in time and it's pointless whim to
force<00:02:46.349> field<00:02:46.560> around<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:47.159> because<00:02:47.549> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
force field around here because the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.210 
force field around here because the
hydras<00:02:48.510> with<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> hydro<00:02:49.079> range<00:02:49.349> out<00:02:49.799> ranges

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
hydras with the hydro range out ranges

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.949 
hydras with the hydro range out ranges
the<00:02:50.340> force<00:02:50.579> field<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.000> his<00:02:51.359> best<00:02:51.629> bet<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
the force field so his best bet is to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.449 
the force field so his best bet is to
cross<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.470> able<00:02:52.650> links<00:02:52.859> out<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.190> he<00:02:53.340> is

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
cross be able links out which he is

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.979 
cross be able links out which he is
doing<00:02:53.730> but<00:02:53.879> they<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.150> manage<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.840> as

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
doing but they do manage to get in as

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.899 
doing but they do manage to get in as
his<00:02:55.500> force<00:02:55.739> will<00:02:55.950> start<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.340> run<00:02:56.519> low<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.670> knees

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
his force will start to run low I knees

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.789 
his force will start to run low I knees
as<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.450> see<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.690> Queen's<00:02:57.959> do<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.440> lot<00:02:58.769> of

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
as you can see the Queen's do a lot of

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.640 
as you can see the Queen's do a lot of
help<00:02:59.129> before<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.120> main<00:03:00.299> portion<00:03:01.139> of<00:03:01.260> hydras

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
help before the main portion of hydras

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.589 
help before the main portion of hydras
arrived<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.280> they're<00:03:02.879> really<00:03:03.299> really<00:03:03.389> useful

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
arrived so they're really really useful

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.509 
arrived so they're really really useful
and<00:03:04.019> then<00:03:04.139> once<00:03:04.409> i'm<00:03:04.590> cleanin<00:03:04.980> up<00:03:05.099> i<00:03:05.220> send<00:03:05.430> them

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
and then once i'm cleanin up i send them

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.970 
and then once i'm cleanin up i send them
all<00:03:05.639> back<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:06.030> inject<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:07.230> yeah<00:03:07.409> this<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.799> still

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
all back to inject so yeah this is still

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.069 
all back to inject so yeah this is still
experimental<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> discussion

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
experimental and this is a discussion

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.740 
experimental and this is a discussion

why<00:03:13.170> if<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.680> think<00:03:13.859> Ling<00:03:14.310> Haider<00:03:14.549> is

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
why if you think Ling Haider is

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.180 
why if you think Ling Haider is
potentially<00:03:15.659> good<00:03:15.870> or<00:03:16.109> if<00:03:16.349> if<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.889> think<00:03:17.069> it's

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
potentially good or if if you think it's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610 
potentially good or if if you think it's
bad<00:03:17.370> why<00:03:17.639> do<00:03:17.699> you<00:03:17.879> think<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.120> bad<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.620> you

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
bad why do you think it's bad and you

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.830 
bad why do you think it's bad and you
know<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.919> think<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.250> late-game<00:03:20.730> comp<00:03:21.569> of

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
