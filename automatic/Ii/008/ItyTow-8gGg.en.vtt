00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.080
 new video of call of duty cos in the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.179
 which we are going to see the new advantages that 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.910
 there is and in itself how the advantages are put 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.299
 in this game that is very different from the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.130
 Earlier, it seems to me that in 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.400
 The subject of advantages is the best call of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.949
 duty that there is because it gives you to choose a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 exquisite customization person and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.710
 brutal as you see we have some these 8 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 slope 8 holes more or less we have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.690
 counted 3 3 and 8 effectively and then 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.550
 we will be able to equip us the advantages 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.340
 that we want either speed driving 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.469
 stealth awareness resistance team and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 elite as you already know in the previous 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.590
 call of duty put you advantage 1 and you had 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.449
 that choosing from those advantages made you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.879
 advantage 2 and you had to catch her two 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.440
 you have to put after 3 advantage had 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.750
 to choose from the 3 always 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.180
 they forced to catch then of the 1 of the 2 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.000
 of the 3 here is not here all mixed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.390
 here 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.630
 you can choose what you get out of the voucher 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.260
 what you want what you want now 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.350
 As you can see we can all 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.080
 these we have seven advantages are crappy 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390
 they are squares but we have seven I take off 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 are a bit hard line for example and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.560
 we have then there are a lot of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.840
 of advantages we have 7 vale 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.299
 more or less then I'm going to show you the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.369
 Prepared less in preparing the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.820
 gun after sprint press 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.220
 fingering agility higher speed 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.170
 Limited sprint marathon movement 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.049
 hunter we have is faster while 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.899
 point this is speed very well handling 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.939
 we come with a strong arm as he throws 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.310
 the team further away from the pages the 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.759
 launches team further reduces time 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.210
 delay of the grenades and restart the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.100
 fuze when returning explosives on 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.679
 march reload while I sprint to this to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.539
 I do not like a call of duty in which 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.539
 reloads while running seems to me 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.610
 unnatural to me I love canceling the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.280
 recharge with the sprint I do not know how much I love it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.530
 from that of downloading reload that appears 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.099
 an uncle and is host canceled 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.890
 I do not know I love red reflex changes 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.480
 weapons and is the fastest team aim 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.730
 Stable increases the accuracy of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.340
 shots from the hips unsheathed 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.220
 fast you score faster in the section 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.860
 of stealth we have to shoot kills enemies 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.100
 without revealing the place of his death you know 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.160
 somebody leaves the calaverita that 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.260
 with this advantage we do not get the skull 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.330
 the next one would be blind eye 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.020
 undetectable for air support 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 oracle systems and silence turrets 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.160
 mortal fear of quietly costs 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.840
 more detect you players with 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.670
 amplify if your steps can hear what 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.680
 amplify I think it was this 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.680
 effectively amplify we will arrive 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.210
 there 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.270
 Incognito resistant to systems 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.340
 Search for white recognition looks 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.100
 thermal look tracker and sensor 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.680
 movement you do not see red name or dot 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.069
 when aiming t 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.709
 also invisible undetectable in the 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.260
 minimap by radar pings and sad 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.989
 com let's go to consciousness we have 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.439
 recognition this came out in the previous 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.000
 coaching y bocón at black ops oms created 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.489
 scavenger of the usual report 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.500
 situation also always 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.090
 amplify the footsteps of the enemies 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.969
 you hear stronger and it's easier 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.250
 detecting them allows you to hear players 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.109
 that use deadly silence what you are 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.450
 seeing in this call of duty is that by 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.430
 example have removed the pro version of 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.530
 the advantages and they have put it as 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.319
 normal perks 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.840
 so there is more quantity more 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.020
 customization where where else to choose and 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.420
 all that worth espionage uses the 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.080
 add-ons activated enemies and allies 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.900
 on the ground about that it's cool that 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.480
 someone does not know you have this advantage and 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.750
 Either enemy ally, you can 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.600
 use resistance temple does not suffer any 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.010
 damage when falling and if your health regenerates 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.230
 more quickly this advantage is very 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.970
 cream I tried it a little and the truth is 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.830
 it shows, it shows and this is a 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.880
 very important advantage and very to have in 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.950
 account 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.190
 tremor reduces bonín since you know 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.740
 tremor resistance tactical shield 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.450
 protector what we always leave with a 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.200
 practical equipment extra lethal extra 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:45.560
 Fully charged extra accessory for 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.140
 his near danger weapons increases the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.569
 damage inflicted with explosives some no 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.050
 I read them because you already know what hand 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.089
 are always the elite option the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.629
 stranger at least already the first 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:02.149
 it's super rare no player appears with a 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:07.380
 random advantage is to say you put yourself 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:09.420
 and you can when this changes then 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.700
 this random advantage is given to you by each 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.910
 Once you die and reappear they give you a 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.700
 different now if you show up with a yes or 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.170
 yes the next time you die and 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.310
 reappear you appear with a 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.380
 hunter or with danger near or with is 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.930
 well I do not know if it is because that is very 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.550
 cream now the leo hard line what's 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.430
 always the good thing is that every two 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.100
 assists count as a low for 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.900
 your streak of going down this is cool 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.580
 I liked this a lot in the modern 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.620
 warfare 3 without the 3 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.300
 I do not know if I think the sides too 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.330
 they were I do not remember that long ago 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.460
 time I do not play active ping 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.449
 a sonar sweep after killing a 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.800
 enemy what reveals to others nearby 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.310
 excess means you can carry the weapons 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.639
 main and we go to the advantage the 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:05.000
 only five-point eye advantage of 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.550
 alcón achieve consecutive losses increases 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.639
 the probability of inflicting more damage with 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.819
 the bullet guns interesting truth 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.920
 yes it will cost 5 slot and you can only 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.540
 then 3 to put 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.220
 Well that would be more than me 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.870
 they loved in a pre fingering me 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.170
 always fingering I'm not a person and 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.300
 Of course, now we have one slot left and 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.890
 so we would put what you want 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.490
 without the elite is good, very good 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:39.540
 and that's why it costs five is logical if 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.270
 it will cost 43 because it is put here all the 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.980
 world that's also not fair and good 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.350
 these are all the advantages all 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.530
 new the new combinations so 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:52.140
 I hope you liked it so a 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:56.330
 like favorites subscribe if you are not 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.330
 and see you in the next video goodbye
