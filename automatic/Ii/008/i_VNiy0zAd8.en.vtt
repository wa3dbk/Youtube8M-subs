00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.220
 greetings to all ladies and gentlemen you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.189
 speaks only grass also known as 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 wash and in this moment I bring you another 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.109
 starcraft 2 video but this time a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.230
 little bit different like you 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.350
 you know well on my channel when I'm 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 making narrations of starcraft 2 what 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.070
 I try to do in a professional manner 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.189
 or at least I think he's professional 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 I do not try to do things like that outside of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.100
 common outside of what is considered 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.170
 would consider a thing about crazy 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 but we have to finally finish 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.649
 and try to finalize 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 the celebration that by the way I'm very 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.640
 happy of that of the five thousand 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.820
 subscribers but we are at the point of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.380
 this video 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.110
 I'm going to do a Starcraft 2 narration 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.309
 but in a way that I guarantee you 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.180
 you have never heard ever 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.480
 try to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.940
 use the speech hammer the speed 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.020
 jammer is 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.230
 a program that in a few words of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.000
 disable to join a sentence in 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.130
 something understandable 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 you can use google search speech flame or 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.869
 you can also search 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.930
 language blocker could serve and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.140
 in a few words the program is in 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.630
 real time 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.080
 to modify my way of speaking so 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.940
 let's activate it at this time and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.460
 you're probably going to notice that I'm a 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.320
 little changing the issue 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.950
 My way of speaking has changed me 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.950
 notably 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.359
 but it's part of the idea 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.420
 so here we go 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.860
 to the planet 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.600
 s 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.600
 your opponent will then be 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 favorite of hero here like the cheap 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 blue 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.739
 This time it is 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.550
 games of double green america 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.150
 as it is evident that no 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.010
 the big ball has arrived 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 detail that is the result 23 here to 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.400
 maicon 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.670
 my god what plans does that take place? 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.670
 moment 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.969
 what has happened to us 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.000
 since to challenge itself 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.690
 completely now let's see the same thing 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.220
 and mobilizing the floor room 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.510
 but it has a center that does not have a 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.510
 persecutor from behind 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.900
 to execute also 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.350
 there is no link this can mean a 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.910
 very complicated issue comes the fight 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.270
 very careful sentry ladies and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.270
 gentlemen 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.210
 nexxo being also the additional core 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.710
 nothing else can you have one three brothers 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.060
 sentinels in total the fight begins 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.060
 temple retreats 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.170
 the workers arrive 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:25.040
 trapped with no way out brother for his life 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:25.040
 the sentinels of the sentinels brother 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:38.090
 additional persecutors can finally 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:38.090
 all ends up finishing these persecutors 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.159
 this is real time brother this is 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:50.409
 this is not happening with an edition in 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.360
 the program I had to disable it for a 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.249
 moment this is not an addition to this 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.449
 is happening in real time is the 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:01.789
 program makes you talk in an unusual way 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.760
 to them I'm going to reactivate what thing 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.490
 so profitable 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.320
 okay 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:14.520
 that I give here 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:19.770
 while while girÃ³n 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.770
 is doing is being the nexus 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.640
 dark tabernacle being built 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.540
 transformed being possible 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.540
 transposition to ladies and gentlemen 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.290
 also an immortal an immortal ladies and 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.330
 gentlemen toque concert player I have to 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.590
 feel like I have to get this 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.440
 I have to concentrate 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.790
 very good to treat us to try to 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.460
 say something institute that consists 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:59.500
 consistently 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:03.510
 finally a nexus 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.510
 on this side looking at the scouts 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.950
 but you do not have enough with your 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.480
 institution you do not have enough 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.480
 units to defend 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.930
 when I finish 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.730
 is being finished, the 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:30.860
 productive construction construction 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:34.290
 of the first colossus being also a 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:39.030
 coronal impulse ladies and gentlemen children 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.670
 and girls ladies and gentlemen because there's no 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.700
 another because there is no cause nearby for 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.700
 be another turn reaching the first 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.050
 that's where the game came 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.870
 right now 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.860
 good brothers I hope that I have 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.810
 liked 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.979
 so that nobody drops that identifies me 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.979
 I do not have much more 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.039
 until the architect and had a next 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.000
