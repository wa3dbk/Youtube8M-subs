00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:20.760
 I have a wheel by the neck left with 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 a motorcycle above 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 and cut me in half not very well 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.320
 It seems a very congratulan detail tsm me 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.710
 Glad the day this happened to me 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.660
 we are here 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.790
 very good but what is happening in this 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.040
 uncle race a corpse on the ground the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.390
 which makes me bounce and reach the moon 9 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.190
 I think everything is very good 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.820
 happening the truth it seems very 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.530
 normal and very consistent so that if these 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.420
 shits and stat was going to see to see to see the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.790
 point of contrast is behind and you have to 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.949
 catch it somehow they will tell me and the 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.479
 outline to me what you have to go through 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.220
 the parkour by that much you go out there 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.620
 so that the game can pass well from 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.370
 So you have been over 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.370
 of the roof could have really jumped 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.840
 the low station 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:18.550
 let's see if I can get on top 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.190
 of parkour what was said super difficult 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.550
 called parkour super difficult 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.380

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.509
 what is yours so blue and is already the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.630
 water has a blue as very strange so 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.729
 as 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.119
 eye eye arrival or by god has to get 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.119

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.890
 Oh no 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.240
 too bad I would say 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.500
 as well as the railing we go nothing 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 too much too bad 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 boys calmly and lightly what 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.750
 lack of concentration of words 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.119
 magical what are the magic words 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.460
 Well Mr. Camps all the best of the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.250
 point 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.420
 never fails if, if yes, 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.619
 is that the magic word never fail 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.870

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.880
 are they lying or are those men 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.380
 it seems really correct to me 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.600
 try to get me up and up really 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.960
 you're really telling me, or is it going 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.220
 seriously not 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.700
 the crazy swing here they have swings 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.700
 military 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.490
 masters that good subscribers that well 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.100
 they do it to see 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.940
 uncle, no, no, no, they have not 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.460
 swing 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.170
 a swing a little bit I would say there's a 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.590
 visit swing 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.750
 the good is what I like to say the most 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.770
 what makes me calm is that what 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:02.730
 then it's easy you know but I do not 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:06.960
 just episodes guys let's go jump 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.990

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.520
 that part and super complicated and that of 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.680
 then it seems that the easier it 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.090
 pursued is that the parties to which 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.590
 we have to climb on top of a thing of 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.200

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.990
 but I do not know how to do it 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.680
 I think you have to have a jump towards 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.079
 the right is sincerely the only 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.150

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.780
 put the motorcycle right and let go 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.510

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.950
