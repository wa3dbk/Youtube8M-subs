00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.139
 I'm going to teach how to make this beautiful 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.250
 shopping bag and cash register 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.250
 for your jai master dolls 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.790
 The materials we will use are 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.140
 hot silicon a pencil or a ruler and 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.340
 scissors a matchbox 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.900
 Cardboard sheets of your colors 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 favorites a thin cardboard box 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.930
 one or two boxes of chewing gum a pencil 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.550
 highlighting color and this ribbon that is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.410
 as a cloth 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.260
 now if you already have all these 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 materials you should go to my page 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 facebook which I leave in the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.739
 video description download this 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 template is actually very easy but 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 which is also the can do with their 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.560
 own measures but they knew that the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.420
 download so let's start 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.090
 The first thing we are going to do is separate 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.610
 this and this box we are going to set aside 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.920
 with radio now we're going to paint it or 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.050
 save as much as you like and if you want 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.210
 you can paint the box but only 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.130
 paint them the variation so I'll 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.830
 I'm going to run remember that it's running 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.400
 also one of the sides and leave some 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.950
 shoes 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.510
 I do cover it with my favorite color like 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.790
 can see below it does not happen in 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.630
 reality is not necessary here they are left 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.880
 the hole now in the bottom small 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.770
 the squares of form so that when 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.090
 goals the little box this one does not stay so 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 inside and can take it out 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.930
 now if you want you can put a 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 cuentita or something here I do not want in 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.030
 I did not really want to paint it but good 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 now let's take a strip of 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 cardboard of the color of the box and go 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.110
 to do a doubles like this and now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.670
 we just keep rolling it 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.670
 so that it is well 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.350
 When you have already rolled it, we will 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.100
 hit aha 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.840
 and we go on 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.900
 Now we take the cardboard box and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.269
 we cut a square 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.840
 of the color that seems right for you 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.840
 screen 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.640
 it will be worth something like this now what 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.490
 let's re-line the color of the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.860
 register machine and they should be left 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.100
 this way now 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.830
 let's stick it to the cardboard strip 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.530
 what we had done 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.130
 and we paste it in the box already lined so 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.500
 They should now be such unions the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.480
 You can cover it with the tape of it 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.880
 color or the color you want but not 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.250
 I'll cover them I like it more like that almost 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.920
 I put it in the suitcase to open it 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.500
 but actually those are watching because I 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.750
 I'm not going to use it now on my page 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.550
 of facebook I leave you as the image of 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.280
 the little screen, if you want, you can not 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.290
 draw I drew it now we're going to 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.920
 paste here and we're going to put the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.290
 decorations well worth me is me 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.390
 although it does not go if it should not be left 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.209
 put here as the keyboard and I put it as 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.959
 You can not decorate the screen like you 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.959
 you want to forget 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.220
 as you can see it opens and inside you can 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.310
 efe 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.070
 if you want how to make money tutorial 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.500
 legally I do it with other areas that 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.720
 they are also short for the guasa is 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.140
 very easy we passed the impression with the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.520
 template to a card that you like and 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.410
 then we talk about it to make a little box 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.980
 when the fall of that more or less 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.959
 so you can decorate it as you want 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.090
 now let's take the bar and go to 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.540
 cut two strips of the same strips 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.430
 the 6-centimeter cuts and now 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.569
 we are going to hit the two in this way 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.640
 sides 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.200
 you should notice you agree very 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.209
 well with the size of the tumor being high 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.489
 As you can see, you can take it from here and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.470
 as the box is not so small it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.470
 can put small objects and things 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.780
 and so must they be 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.700
 If you do this craft please do not 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.830

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.169
