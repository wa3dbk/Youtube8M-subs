stitching along and they get to the edge
and<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.430> machine<00:01:47.700> only<00:01:48.060> goes<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.720> speed

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and this machine only goes one speed

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620 
and this machine only goes one speed
imagine<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.430> machine<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
imagine this one machine is here and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.289 
imagine this one machine is here and
it's<00:01:51.780> got<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.680> got<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> wheel

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
it's got up here it's got this wheel

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.469 
it's got up here it's got this wheel
okay<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.670> sewing

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
okay and so it's it's the sewing

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.770 
okay and so it's it's the sewing
machines<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.680> needle

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
machines like this they have a needle

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
machines like this they have a needle
and<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> corner<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.790> have

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and they get to the corner and they have

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.330 
and they get to the corner and they have
the<00:02:02.969> slow<00:02:03.149> down<00:02:03.299> stop<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:04.770> turn<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the slow down stop and then they turn it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.290 
the slow down stop and then they turn it
and<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.090> goes<00:02:06.210> drink<00:02:06.920> drink<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.879> then<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.090> get

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and it goes drink drink and then go get

and it goes drink drink and then go get
a<00:02:09.360> few<00:02:09.629> stitches<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> corner<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.619> then

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
a few stitches on the corner and then

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.890 
a few stitches on the corner and then
they<00:02:11.400> put<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> pedal<00:02:12.030> down<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.599> metal

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
they put the pedal down to the metal

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.580 
they put the pedal down to the metal
literally

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
literally

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.260 
literally
and<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.310> goes<00:02:14.400> down<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.239> I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and it goes down like this and then I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.030 
and it goes down like this and then I
get<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.569> corner<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.989> what<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:16.890> they<00:02:16.980> do

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
get to the corner and what do they do

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.180 
get to the corner and what do they do
they<00:02:17.489> stop<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:18.780> turn<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.410> wheel<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.860> punch

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
they stop they turn this wheel and punch

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.589 
they stop they turn this wheel and punch
it<00:02:20.340> punch<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.880> needle<00:02:21.090> through<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.330> leather

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
it punch the needle through the leather

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.710 
it punch the needle through the leather
again<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.140> go<00:02:22.260> Street<00:02:22.640> Street<00:02:23.720> several

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
again we go Street Street several

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.880 
again we go Street Street several
stitches<00:02:25.050> around<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> corner<00:02:25.650> around<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
stitches around the corner around the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.729 
stitches around the corner around the
turns<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:26.790> they<00:02:27.290> put<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> pedal<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
turns and then they put the pedal to the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.839 
turns and then they put the pedal to the
metal<00:02:28.920> again<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.370> pretty<00:02:29.520> soon<00:02:29.640> they<00:02:29.760> get

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
metal again and pretty soon they get

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.339 
metal again and pretty soon they get
tired<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.209> doing<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.569> if<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> cheap

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
tired of doing that if they have a cheap

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.660 
tired of doing that if they have a cheap
machine<00:02:31.680> there<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.160> go<00:02:33.950> dip<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.250> they

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
machine there they go dip it and they

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.120 
machine there they go dip it and they
they<00:02:36.090> zip<00:02:36.390> around<00:02:36.599> these<00:02:36.750> corners<00:02:37.019> they<00:02:37.800> think

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
they zip around these corners they think

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.220 
they zip around these corners they think
of<00:02:38.190> these<00:02:38.280> wide<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:40.340> I'll<00:02:41.340> show<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.989> is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
of these wide so I'll show you this is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.930 
of these wide so I'll show you this is
really<00:02:43.769> important<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.430> seems<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> real

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
really important it seems like a real

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.250 
really important it seems like a real
small<00:02:45.120> detail<00:02:48.319> okay<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.299> they<00:02:51.299> come<00:02:51.780> down<00:02:51.930> here

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
small detail okay so they come down here

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.559 
small detail okay so they come down here
there's<00:02:52.650> equally<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.610> perfectly<00:02:54.030> along<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
there's equally it's perfectly along the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.449 
there's equally it's perfectly along the
edge<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.019> they<00:02:55.140> get<00:02:55.350> close<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.400> they

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
edge and then they get close and they

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.100 
edge and then they get close and they
get<00:02:56.610> real<00:02:56.760> close<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> edge<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.690> then<00:02:57.959> they

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
get real close to the edge and then they

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930 
get real close to the edge and then they
get<00:02:58.470> back<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> guy<00:02:59.069> that's<00:02:59.340> part<00:02:59.730> again

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
get back on the guy that's part again

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.690 
get back on the guy that's part again
and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.810> get<00:03:01.019> real<00:03:01.410> wide<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.549> then

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
and then they get real wide and then

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.300 
and then they get real wide and then
they<00:03:02.819> come<00:03:03.440> let's<00:03:04.440> see<00:03:04.560> how<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.950> gets<00:03:05.130> real

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
they come let's see how it gets real

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.009 
they come let's see how it gets real
close<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> edge<00:03:05.849> here<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> guess<00:03:06.690> wide

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
close to the edge here then I guess wide

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.180 
close to the edge here then I guess wide
because<00:03:07.650> they<00:03:07.739> don't<00:03:07.860> want<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> slow<00:03:08.160> down

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
because they don't want to slow down

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.910 
because they don't want to slow down
because<00:03:08.580> they're<00:03:08.730> tired<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.450> all<00:03:10.230> day<00:03:10.590> long

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
because they're tired of all day long

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.610 
because they're tired of all day long
turning<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.549> wheel<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.410> they<00:03:13.410> take<00:03:13.560> a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
turning that wheel so they they take a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
turning that wheel so they they take a
little<00:03:13.799> shortcuts<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.610> then<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> second

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
little shortcuts and then the second

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.599 
little shortcuts and then the second
stitch<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.870> even<00:03:16.650> does<00:03:17.130> they<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.340> guide

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
stitch is even does they have a guide

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.970 
stitch is even does they have a guide
that<00:03:18.090> followed<00:03:18.390> that<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.660> follow<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.170> then

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
that followed that they follow and then

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.140 
that followed that they follow and then
the<00:03:20.130> next<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.430> they<00:03:20.549> come<00:03:20.700> around<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> curve

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the next and they come around the curve

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.660 
the next and they come around the curve
at<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> high<00:03:21.810> speed<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.410> they<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
at a high speed and they so it's the

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.050 
at a high speed and they so it's the
curves<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.329> corners<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.950> keep<00:03:32.220> on

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
curves and the corners that that keep on

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.340 
curves and the corners that that keep on
cheap<00:03:33.420> machines<00:03:33.569> they<00:03:33.930> don't<00:03:34.109> have<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
cheap machines they don't have the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.590 
cheap machines they don't have the
clutch<00:03:34.730> I'll<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.940> lighting<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.450> how<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
clutch I'll have the lighting of how the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.420 
clutch I'll have the lighting of how the
guides<00:03:36.840> they<00:03:37.109> don't<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.620> larger

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
guides they don't have the larger

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.970 
guides they don't have the larger
bobbins<00:03:38.819> all<00:03:38.970> these<00:03:39.150> things<00:03:39.420> add<00:03:39.840> into<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
bobbins all these things add into the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.240 
bobbins all these things add into the
quality<00:03:42.769> stitching<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.889> quality

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
quality stitching the quality

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.309 
quality stitching the quality
craftsmanship<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.269> in<00:03:45.540> our<00:03:46.049> bags

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
craftsmanship that you get in our bags

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.440 
craftsmanship that you get in our bags
and<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:49.049> anyway<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.549> our<00:03:50.549> machinery<00:03:50.940> that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
and so anyway this is our machinery that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.059 
and so anyway this is our machinery that
we've<00:03:51.569> invested<00:03:52.079> heavily<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.500> our<00:03:52.650> machinery

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
we've invested heavily in our machinery

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.520 
we've invested heavily in our machinery
and<00:03:53.459> we've<00:03:54.180> invested<00:03:54.480> heavily<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:54.989> our<00:03:55.139> people

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
and we've invested heavily in our people

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.259 
and we've invested heavily in our people
so<00:03:55.829> we<00:03:55.980> don't<00:03:56.130> lose<00:03:56.310> people<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.790> we<00:03:57.180> don't

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
so we don't lose people and we don't

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.360 
so we don't lose people and we don't
lose<00:03:57.450> machinery<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.799> also<00:03:59.069> want<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.220> machine

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
lose machinery and also want a machine

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.129 
lose machinery and also want a machine
