the jamming device scoop is really short

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.779 
the jamming device scoop is really short
if<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.289> try<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.530> do<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:46.949> and<00:04:47.190> do<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.370> wrong

if you try to do this and do it wrong

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.540 
if you try to do this and do it wrong
you<00:04:48.630> can<00:04:48.780> easily<00:04:48.960> end<00:04:49.500> up<00:04:49.590> losing<00:04:50.190> your<00:04:50.340> case

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550

you<00:04:52.590> ever<00:04:52.740> seen<00:04:53.039> it<00:04:53.190> because<00:04:53.400> I'm<00:04:53.490> not<00:04:53.550> sure

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
you ever seen it because I'm not sure

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.610 
you ever seen it because I'm not sure
I've<00:04:53.849> showed<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.240> off<00:04:54.330> but<00:04:55.139> if<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.320> lose<00:04:55.560> a

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
scoop like that you actually it actually

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.460 
scoop like that you actually it actually
ends<00:04:59.699> your<00:04:59.849> game<00:05:00.090> well<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:00.900> says<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.229> truth

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
will never be found kind of all more

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.870 
will never be found kind of all more
windy<00:05:03.539> when<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:03.840> kill<00:05:04.020> someone<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:04.620> then

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
windy when you kill someone and then

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.589 
windy when you kill someone and then
basically<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:06.510> have<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.139> opportunity<00:05:07.380> to

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
basically you have the opportunity to

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.770 
basically you have the opportunity to
start<00:05:09.599> over<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:10.229> new<00:05:10.470> save<00:05:10.770> just<00:05:11.460> either<00:05:11.789> let<00:05:12.659> it

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
start over a new save just either let it

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.230 
start over a new save just either let it
play<00:05:13.050> out<00:05:13.169> from<00:05:13.620> there<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.190> you'll<00:05:14.520> never<00:05:14.729> see

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
play out from there and you'll never see

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.540 
play out from there and you'll never see
the<00:05:15.360> true<00:05:15.570> ending<00:05:15.960> or<00:05:16.199> you<00:05:16.889> can<00:05:17.039> start<00:05:17.400> over

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
the true ending or you can start over

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.270 
the true ending or you can start over
from<00:05:17.849> the<00:05:17.909> beginning<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.570> whatever

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.520 

and<00:05:22.280> here<00:05:22.670> they<00:05:23.090> do<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.450> nice<00:05:23.720> little<00:05:24.080> stacked

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
and here they do the nice little stacked

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.290 
and here they do the nice little stacked
on<00:05:24.800> top<00:05:24.830> of<00:05:25.040> each<00:05:25.220> other<00:05:25.340> thing<00:05:25.700> but<00:05:25.970> we<00:05:26.120> have

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
on top of each other thing but we have

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.480 
on top of each other thing but we have
two<00:05:26.480> people<00:05:26.690> who<00:05:26.930> we<00:05:27.050> can<00:05:27.170> actually<00:05:27.290> grab<00:05:28.220> so

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
two people who we can actually grab so

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.850 
two people who we can actually grab so
it<00:05:28.580> makes<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.820> little<00:05:28.970> bit<00:05:29.150> easier<00:05:29.710> Gil<00:05:30.710> of

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860
