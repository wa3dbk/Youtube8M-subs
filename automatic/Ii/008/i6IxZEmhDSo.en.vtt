well it's just really really bad if I'm

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.039 
well it's just really really bad if I'm
trying<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.430> be<00:02:57.519> even<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.909> slightest<00:02:58.480> like<00:02:58.810> an

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
trying to be even the slightest like an

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.070 
trying to be even the slightest like an
isle<00:02:59.379> of<00:02:59.470> man<00:02:59.709> racer<00:03:00.010> then<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.239> bad

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.200 

but<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.770> was<00:03:05.890> quite<00:03:06.160> okay<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.910> easiness

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
but it was quite okay with the easiness

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.760 
but it was quite okay with the easiness
to<00:03:07.330> maneuver<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.020> bikes<00:03:08.290> through<00:03:08.590> the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
to maneuver the bikes through the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.450 
to maneuver the bikes through the
twistiest

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
twistiest

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.930 
twistiest
it's<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.840> likeable<00:03:11.500> enough<00:03:11.940> stability

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
it's just not likeable enough stability

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.140 
it's just not likeable enough stability
is<00:03:13.510> questionable<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.980> ride<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.550> comfortable

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
is questionable the ride is comfortable

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.870 
is questionable the ride is comfortable
but<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:17.170> affect<00:03:17.530> your<00:03:17.740> cornering<00:03:18.160> trajectory

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
but it affect your cornering trajectory

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.860 
but it affect your cornering trajectory
a<00:03:18.910> little<00:03:20.370> then<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.610> decided<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.450> ride<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.840> like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
a little then I decided to ride it like

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.460 
a little then I decided to ride it like
a<00:03:23.350> normal<00:03:23.560> person<00:03:23.980> would<00:03:30.540> yeah<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.900> talked

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
a normal person would yeah I talked

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.140 
a normal person would yeah I talked
about<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.860> being<00:03:33.040> sensible<00:03:33.610> at<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.790> start<00:03:34.090> of

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
about it being sensible at the start of

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.180 
about it being sensible at the start of
the<00:03:34.300> film<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.960> it<00:03:35.440> just<00:03:35.620> don't<00:03:35.800> get<00:03:35.980> any

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
the film and it just don't get any

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.140 
the film and it just don't get any
better<00:03:36.400> than<00:03:36.670> that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
better than that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.080 
better than that
the<00:03:37.780> purpose<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.410> cb500<00:03:39.280> s<00:03:39.430> or<00:03:39.730> i<00:03:39.760> think

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
the purpose of the cb500 s or i think

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.630

the whole 500 series from Honda is just

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.580 
the whole 500 series from Honda is just

talky and it does give an idea of it

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.120 
talky and it does give an idea of it
being<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.630> city<00:03:58.900> commuter<00:03:59.410> more<00:03:59.860> than<00:04:00.100> a

being a city commuter more than a

being a city commuter more than a
long-distance<00:04:00.550> vehicle<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.440> quite<00:04:02.709> like

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
long-distance vehicle and I quite like

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.710 
long-distance vehicle and I quite like
the<00:04:03.040> idea<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.670> looking<00:04:04.000> like<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.209> touring

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the idea of it looking like a touring

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.440 
the idea of it looking like a touring
bike<00:04:04.930> but<00:04:05.770> it's<00:04:05.890> just<00:04:06.070> not<00:04:06.250> one<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
bike but it's just not one the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.390 
bike but it's just not one the
windscreen<00:04:08.050> for<00:04:08.080> example<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.770> too<00:04:08.950> small<00:04:09.340> for

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
windscreen for example is too small for

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.270 
windscreen for example is too small for
me<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.750> fuel<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.260> economic<00:04:11.800> if<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.160> are

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
me the fuel is economic if you are

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.550 
me the fuel is economic if you are
cruising<00:04:12.760> around<00:04:12.850> 120<00:04:13.810> kilometres<00:04:14.320> an<00:04:14.440> hour

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
cruising around 120 kilometres an hour

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.920 
cruising around 120 kilometres an hour
but<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.730> won't<00:04:15.970> be<00:04:16.120> if<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.390> are<00:04:16.450> going<00:04:16.480> more

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
but it won't be if you are going more

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.039 
but it won't be if you are going more
than<00:04:16.989> 150<00:04:17.799> which<00:04:17.980> is<00:04:18.130> about<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.730> limit<00:04:19.049> the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
not really that tall at all I understand

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.850 
not really that tall at all I understand
that<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.480> gives<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.810> certain<00:04:25.990> confident<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.830> a

that it gives a certain confident to a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
beginner rider but the bike is already

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.100 
beginner rider but the bike is already
basic<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.070> easy<00:04:30.370> enough<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.730> ride<00:04:31.110> the

pricing<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.830> bug<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.190> surely<00:04:33.700> competitive

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
pricing of the bug is surely competitive

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.630 
pricing of the bug is surely competitive
but<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:34.900> don't<00:04:35.230> see<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.620> becoming<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.190> bike<00:04:36.430> that

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
but I don't see it becoming a bike that

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.280 
but I don't see it becoming a bike that
everyone<00:04:37.120> would<00:04:37.240> buy<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.810> because<00:04:37.870> it's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
everyone would buy just because it's

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.159 
everyone would buy just because it's
cheap<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:39.490> lack<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:39.820> assignment<00:04:40.540> really<00:04:40.900> just

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
cheap the lack of assignment really just

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.140 
cheap the lack of assignment really just
turns<00:04:41.530> off<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.040> interest<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.580> invest<00:04:42.910> such

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
turns off the interest to invest such

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.810 
turns off the interest to invest such
money<00:04:43.480> onto<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> bike<00:04:44.169> like<00:04:44.410> this<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.980> am<00:04:45.790> NOT

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
money onto a bike like this I am NOT

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.960 
money onto a bike like this I am NOT
saying<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.480> cb500x<00:04:47.410> is<00:04:47.590> not<00:04:47.800> good<00:04:48.100> but

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
saying that the cb500x is not good but

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.469 
saying that the cb500x is not good but
it's<00:04:49.150> just<00:04:49.210> every

it's just every

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.650 
buy from Honda personally I don't think
so<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:58.009> at<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.220> end<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.520> day<00:04:58.699> it<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.389> best

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
so but at the end of the day it is best

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.450 
so but at the end of the day it is best
to<00:04:59.810> buy<00:05:00.020> anything<00:05:00.410> that<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.800> want<00:05:01.039> that<00:05:01.220> fits

your needs rather than following others

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.920 
your needs rather than following others
