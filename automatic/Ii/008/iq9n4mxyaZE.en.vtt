 The water of roses is super simple 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.789
 It is very good for all skin types 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.730

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.560

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.269
 your roses 34 days already when you see that 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.519
 they are like withering then it is 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.629
 the perfect time to make water from 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.850
 roses ok 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.039
 you can use any color of roses 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.809
 there are people who say that each color of 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.750
 Rosa has different benefits in the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.240
 skin to me I do not know I do not know in this 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.440
 I'm going to use pink a rose 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.920
 yellow 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.500
 white roses I use three roses to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.020
 take out water that gives me about a month 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.450
 two months of personal use you can 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.720
 do in large quantities by putting them 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.090
 more roses a dozen two dozen is like 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.680
 you want ok then the since 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.480
 we buy or since we have our 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.520
 roses at home we wash them well with 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.470
 cold water to remove any excess 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.320
 of little dust they have out there 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.750
 and we leave them styling since they are dry 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.360
 then we are going to defoliate them and 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.360
 let's put on a plate or in a bowl 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.540
 deep to continue making our water 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.120
 of roses ok so soy we all 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.120
 our roses that we have 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.150
 since we have stripped roses and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.159
 we have in our deep bowl then 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.900
 we are simply going to add water 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:28.060
 boiling water has to be super 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.060
 hot so with careful ok 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.780
 now we just have to wait for this to happen 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.850
 cool let it stand for 1 to 2 hours 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.770
 once that is already cold have 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.080
 after two hours two and a half hours 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.390
 the time that you want then already 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.730
 is ready to use the schools and 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.860
 you keep it in a big bottle or what 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.960
 You can put in any container that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.810
 the 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.240
 refrigerate and another option you can put 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.670
 in this type of packaging that have 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.770
 atomizer that is how I do it and what 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.090
 I keep in my bathroom another I keep it in 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.190

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.840
 another refrigerator next to my bed I 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.730
 I have rose water everywhere 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.990
 I have very dry skin and this helps me 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.450
