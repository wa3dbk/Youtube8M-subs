00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.610 
surfaces of these are all a lot black I
guess<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.899> gonna<00:00:46.020> paint<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> concrete

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
guess if you gonna paint the concrete

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
guess if you gonna paint the concrete
bring<00:00:46.829> black<00:00:47.039> paint<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> here's<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:47.940> at

the middle part of the park a lot of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.650 
the middle part of the park a lot of
really<00:00:49.890> cool<00:00:50.070> obstacles<00:00:50.670> again<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.570> see

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
really cool obstacles again you can see

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.029 
really cool obstacles again you can see
it's<00:00:51.750> nice<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.930> long<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.559> need<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> get

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's nice and long so if you need to get

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's nice and long so if you need to get
a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.280> speed<00:00:53.579> there's<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.600> lot<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.870> room<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a lot of speed there's a lot of room to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.510 
a lot of speed there's a lot of room to
do<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:55.920> you're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
do that if you're going to go off the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.840 
do that if you're going to go off the
jump<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> end<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.670> see

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
jump at the end of it so you can see

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660 
jump at the end of it so you can see
from<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.570> ramp<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> far<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
from here that ramp at the far end has a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.340 
from here that ramp at the far end has a
good<00:01:02.940> kick<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.780> four<00:01:03.989> feet<00:01:04.140> high

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
good kick to it and it's four feet high

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.679 
good kick to it and it's four feet high
so<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.830> too<00:01:05.129> big<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.880> dangerous<00:01:06.479> but

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
so it's not too big and dangerous but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
so it's not too big and dangerous but
it's<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.200> enough<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.010> lift<00:01:08.220> off<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it's it's enough to get some lift off of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
it's it's enough to get some lift off of
and<00:01:08.820> work<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.240> aerial<00:01:09.570> stunts<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> pull

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and work on your aerial stunts and pull

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
and work on your aerial stunts and pull
the<00:01:10.680> backflip<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.549> you've<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> speed<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the backflip if you've got the speed for

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140 
the backflip if you've got the speed for
it<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.680> great<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.430> learning<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it so it's just great for learning this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
it so it's just great for learning this
is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> best<00:01:15.630> part<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.930> found<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.580> other

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
is the best part be found for that other

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
is the best part be found for that other
than<00:01:17.670> wood<00:01:17.970> water<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.420> can't<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.810> there

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
than wood water but we can't go up there

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
than wood water but we can't go up there
because<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.200> too<00:01:19.409> far<00:01:19.590> too<00:01:19.890> expensive<00:01:20.040> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
because that's too far too expensive so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.969 
because that's too far too expensive so
this<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> back<00:01:22.950> side

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this will do and then on the back side

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.929 
this will do and then on the back side
of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> park<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> obstacles

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
of the park you can see the obstacles

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.490 
of the park you can see the obstacles
here<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.360> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> smaller<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.229> for

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
here they're kind of smaller I think for

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.569 
here they're kind of smaller I think for
littler<00:01:28.740> kids<00:01:28.950> somebody<00:01:29.250> dragged<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
littler kids somebody dragged the
