and I think it all hinges on the referee
in<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> referee<00:01:44.550> if<00:01:44.760> he's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
in there I think the referee if he's

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.310 
in there I think the referee if he's
strong<00:01:45.150> enough<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> let<00:01:45.750> him<00:01:45.870> fight<00:01:46.080> on<00:01:46.229> the

you<00:04:33.750> know<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:33.990> he's<00:04:34.920> just<00:04:35.250> too<00:04:35.490> strong<00:04:35.790> so<00:04:35.850> we

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
you know it's he's just too strong so we

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.020 
you know it's he's just too strong so we
are<00:04:36.270> holding<00:04:36.480> back<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.430> think<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.640> this<00:04:38.790> fight

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
are holding back I think in this fight

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.700 
are holding back I think in this fight
because<00:04:39.390> you've<00:04:39.540> got<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.690> clash<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.050> Sue<00:04:40.230> Styles

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
because you've got a clash of Sue Styles

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.350 
because you've got a clash of Sue Styles
you've<00:04:40.860> got<00:04:41.040> Floyd<00:04:41.490> Mayweather<00:04:41.910> who<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.120> would

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
you've got Floyd Mayweather who I would

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.780 
you've got Floyd Mayweather who I would
say<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.810> best<00:04:43.050> boxer<00:04:43.530> in<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.680> world<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.250> I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
say is the best boxer in the world and I

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.490 
say is the best boxer in the world and I
would<00:04:44.940> say<00:04:45.180> there<00:04:45.390> you've<00:04:45.660> got<00:04:45.690> Ritchie<00:04:46.110> Ricky

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
would say there you've got Ritchie Ricky

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.110 
would say there you've got Ritchie Ricky
out<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.890> he's<00:04:47.250> probably<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.730> best<00:04:47.910> in

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
out and he's probably the best in

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.520 
out and he's probably the best in
fighters<00:04:48.510> in<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.750> world<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.170> I<00:04:49.230> think<00:04:49.290> you've

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
fighters in the world so I think you've

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.560 
fighters in the world so I think you've
got<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.740> recipe<00:04:49.980> for<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.430> great<00:04:50.640> fight<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.180> I

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
got a recipe for a great fight and I

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.540 
got a recipe for a great fight and I
think<00:04:51.750> if<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.410> referee<00:04:52.740> more<00:04:53.070> or<00:04:53.220> less<00:04:53.340> says

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
think if the referee more or less says

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.460 
think if the referee more or less says
right<00:04:53.790> let<00:04:54.240> them<00:04:54.330> fight<00:04:54.510> on<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.780> outside<00:04:54.810> what

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
right let them fight on the outside what

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.830 
right let them fight on the outside what
if<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.340> comes<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.270> gets<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.510> little<00:04:57.630> bit

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
if it comes to that it gets a little bit

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.570 
if it comes to that it gets a little bit
of<00:04:57.930> rough<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.320> inside<00:04:58.680> let's<00:04:58.950> see<00:04:59.400> what

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
of rough on the inside let's see what

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.040
