00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 a wrong patent pattern is not 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.960
 patent but it looks like the mesh 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.710
 Number should be divisible by four +3 +2 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 that means eight would be part of four 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.449
 +3 +2 advertise 13 stitches 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 also twelve who divisible by four +3 +2 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 edge stitches would be 17 stitches of the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.240
 pattern consists of two rows in the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.240
 first row knit a hem stitch 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 then three stitches on the right a stitch 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:54.770
 left and that repeats the whole 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:54.770
 row one right on the left 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.920
 it's all about a rand mesh 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.740
 had to row her make your hand stitch 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:36.850
 a stitch on the right is a stitch on the left 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.590
 the preparation and then you stretch 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:51.190
 three stitches on the right a machine x3 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:58.390
 mesh on the right a mesh left three 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:01.180
 mesh on the right a mesh left and to 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.370
 conclusion remains a right and a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.140
 edge stitch and repeat this pattern 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.440
 you and I show you the same 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.320
 result the pattern is very elastic 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.930
 it also consumes less wool than 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.370
 normal patent and is also faster 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.160
 knit not every row twice 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.320
 Knitted is so in comparison to 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:37.450
 patent had to be there are already differences 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:41.110
 but it looks quite similar to that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.130
 between a little bit different 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.700
 but only if you look carefully that's it 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.910
 for today 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.709
 I wish you a perfect day 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.709
 and a nice weekend
