00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
the right hand is all over the place but

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.650 
the right hand is all over the place but
the<00:00:58.220> tricky<00:00:58.460> part<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.760> this<00:00:58.910> song<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.420> that

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
the tricky part of this song is that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.530 
the tricky part of this song is that
it's<00:00:59.809> in<00:00:59.989> three<00:01:00.950> but<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:01.820> fast<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.420> you

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's in three but it's so fast that you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.180 
it's in three but it's so fast that you
have<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.750> feel<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.020> as<00:01:03.230> one<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.009> kind<00:01:04.160> of

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
have to feel it as one so it's kind of

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.460 
have to feel it as one so it's kind of
one<00:01:04.489> two<00:01:04.759> three<00:01:05.059> one<00:01:05.360> two<00:01:05.390> three<00:01:05.630> one<00:01:05.930> two

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.330 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:06.920> two<00:01:07.070> three

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.219 

if<00:01:10.850> your<00:01:11.030> metronome<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.509> on<00:01:11.660> that<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.990> would<00:01:12.050> be

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
if your metronome is on that it would be

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.550 
if your metronome is on that it would be
not<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.070> much<00:01:13.250> fun<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.180> instead<00:01:14.660> of<00:01:14.720> try<00:01:15.530> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
not that much fun so instead of try to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:29.160 
not that much fun so instead of try to
follow<00:01:15.860> along<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.550> beat<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:17.170> one<00:01:18.640> three<00:01:28.000> so

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
follow along to a beat of one three so

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.990 
follow along to a beat of one three so
that's<00:01:30.170> gonna<00:01:30.440> be<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.619> hard<00:01:30.830> part<00:01:30.890> but<00:01:31.520> the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
that's gonna be the hard part but the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.880 
that's gonna be the hard part but the
other<00:01:32.119> parts<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.200> right<00:01:33.229> hand<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.710> pretty

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
other parts the right hand is pretty

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.649 
other parts the right hand is pretty

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
try that right hand particle so do that

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.870 
try that right hand particle so do that
first<00:01:51.350> phrase<00:01:51.619> up<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.979> measure<00:01:52.130> eight<00:01:52.490> like

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880

the same after that it's a yeah the
second<00:02:08.019> phrase<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.530> little<00:02:08.769> softer<00:02:09.250> it's

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
second phrase is a little softer it's

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.839

this<00:02:27.709> one's<00:02:27.920> kind<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.190> tricky<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.540> left

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
this one's kind of tricky with the left

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.540 
this one's kind of tricky with the left
hand<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.140> start<00:02:30.440> throwing<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.770> sharp<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:31.280> but

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
hand to start throwing that sharp in but

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.100 
hand to start throwing that sharp in but
it's<00:02:31.670> nothing<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.030> high<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.959> right

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
it's nothing that high then the right

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.839 
it's nothing that high then the right
hand<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.410> moving<00:02:33.560> all<00:02:33.800> over<00:02:34.099> -<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.580> try<00:02:34.819> that

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
hand is moving all over - so try that

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:44.530 
hand is moving all over - so try that
from<00:02:35.750> what<00:02:35.900> one<00:02:36.200> hand<00:02:36.380> at<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> time<00:02:43.390> see<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
from what one hand at a time see that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.360 
from what one hand at a time see that
circle<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:46.330> 12<00:02:47.330> that's<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.380> yeah<00:02:48.620> that's<00:02:49.250> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
circle to 12 that's a yeah that's a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.680 
circle to 12 that's a yeah that's a
switch<00:02:49.580> right<00:02:49.760> there<00:02:49.970> that's<00:02:50.180> gonna<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> big

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
switch right there that's gonna be a big

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:02.680 
switch right there that's gonna be a big
 the<00:02:53.060> third<00:02:53.300> part<00:02:53.540> is

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.790 

so<00:03:03.690> that's<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.020> third<00:03:04.200> phrase<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.650> should

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
so that's the third phrase you should

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.440 
so that's the third phrase you should
label<00:03:04.950> these<00:03:05.190> numbers<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.730> were<00:03:05.820> practicing

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
label these numbers that were practicing

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.090 
label these numbers that were practicing
make<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> little<00:03:07.080> box<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.500> write<00:03:07.680> your<00:03:07.800> three

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
make a little box and write your three

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100 
make a little box and write your three
there<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:09.150> practice<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.840> third

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
there and then practice this third

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.070 
there and then practice this third
section<00:03:10.410> over<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.100> over<00:03:11.340> third<00:03:11.580> phrase<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.840> do

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
section over and over third phrase so do

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.920 
section over and over third phrase so do
the<00:03:13.200> right<00:03:13.380> hand<00:03:13.620> again<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:14.280> its<00:03:14.490> own<00:03:17.930> than

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the right hand again on its own than

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.790 
the right hand again on its own than
five<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.110> hand<00:03:25.350> positions

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
five it's kind of like to hand positions

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.740 
five it's kind of like to hand positions
but<00:03:26.160> at<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.030> end<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.210> that<00:03:27.330> first<00:03:27.510> hand

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
but at the end of that first hand
