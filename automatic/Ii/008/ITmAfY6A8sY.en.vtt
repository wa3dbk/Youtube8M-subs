those<00:03:34.360> miracles<00:03:34.570> whether<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.580> I'm<00:03:36.580> guessing<00:03:37.300> I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
those miracles whether so I'm guessing I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.650

was<00:03:37.510> never<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.840> real<00:03:38.140> trouble<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.360> then

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
was never in real trouble but and then

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.900 
was never in real trouble but and then
suddenly<00:03:41.110> I<00:03:41.410> took<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.830> little<00:03:42.130> bit<00:03:42.370> over<00:03:42.730> but

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
suddenly I took a little bit over but

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.460 
suddenly I took a little bit over but
okay<00:03:43.560> probably<00:03:44.560> never<00:03:44.710> was<00:03:44.890> enough<00:03:46.440> John

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470

but<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.460> looked<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:12.850> an<00:04:13.210> extraordinary<00:04:13.630> turn

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
but I looked like an extraordinary turn

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.920 
but I looked like an extraordinary turn
around<00:04:14.410> at<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.590> end<00:04:14.680> yeah<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.730> looks<00:04:15.910> like<00:04:15.970> I

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
around at the end yeah it looks like I

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.789 
around at the end yeah it looks like I
wasn't<00:04:17.470> sure<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:17.620> what<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.340> evaluation<00:04:18.700> of

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
wasn't sure of what the evaluation of

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.190 
wasn't sure of what the evaluation of
full<00:04:20.799> position<00:04:21.280> but<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:22.090> was<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:22.750> complicated

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
full position but it was so complicated

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:31.110 
full position but it was so complicated
before<00:04:24.160> before<00:04:26.460> move<00:04:27.460> for<00:04:27.940> 40<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:29.610> at<00:04:30.610> some

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
before before move for 40 so at some

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.690 
before before move for 40 so at some
point<00:04:31.180> my<00:04:32.170> position<00:04:32.620> was<00:04:32.830> too<00:04:33.040> dangerous<00:04:33.160> I

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
point my position was too dangerous I

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.000 
point my position was too dangerous I
think<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:34.030> think<00:04:34.300> but<00:04:35.140> ok<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.770> was<00:04:36.160> lucky<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:38.010> push

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
think I think but ok I was lucky to push

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.670 
think I think but ok I was lucky to push
my<00:04:39.250> pawn<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.970> Nate<00:04:40.120> -<00:04:40.300> just<00:04:40.630> just<00:04:41.020> one<00:04:41.200> time<00:04:41.440> and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
my pawn on Nate - just just one time and

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.270 
my pawn on Nate - just just one time and
after<00:04:42.460> time<00:04:43.420> trouble<00:04:43.960> I'm<00:04:44.590> not<00:04:44.830> sure<00:04:45.040> what

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
after time trouble I'm not sure what

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.970 
after time trouble I'm not sure what
what<00:04:45.550> is<00:04:45.700> my<00:04:45.880> position<00:04:46.090> but<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:47.260> think<00:04:47.650> Here<00:04:47.860> I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
what is my position but I think Here I

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.840 
what is my position but I think Here I
am<00:04:48.010> NOT<00:04:48.310> at<00:04:48.460> risk

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
am NOT at risk

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.310 
am NOT at risk
so<00:04:49.840> oops<00:04:50.410> looks<00:04:50.800> dangerous<00:04:51.550> for<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.880> wait<00:04:52.320> did

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
so oops looks dangerous for a wait did

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.440 
so oops looks dangerous for a wait did
