00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 good evening with you Catherine Majorov 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.490
 image maker today is the topic of our seminar 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.759
 choice of evening dress 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 Why this topic is relevant is clear that 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.970
 each approach of the new year is associated 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 with a variety of his celebrations my 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.310
 corporate before celebrating the new year 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 meeting the new year in principle and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 the problem of the choice of evening and cocktail 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.279
 dresses becomes very relevant I can 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.719
 to tell by experience what the last 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.630
 two three weeks before the new year 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.989
 approximately 4 cocktail dresses per day 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.460
 evening I buy with customers because 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 that everything is understandably pulled up 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 the last moment we urgently now 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.340
 three days to corporate party there is no dress and all 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.500
 running around and looking for a dress, put a plus sign 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.020
 for whom the familiar problem that you start 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 look for outfit for some holiday 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.280
 no matter release of the new year 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.080
 corporate some wedding for which 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.299
 invited and so on and so forth in 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.110
 the last moment you wait until 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.189
 secured 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 and then run choose something and often 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.900
 From the experience of my clients, I can say that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.710
 they take not that much, but yes 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.320
 just to grab something because 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 It is not to look for ever and time and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 often it turns out a dress for one 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 an evening which also does not bring 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.900
 joy and pleasure that is then 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560
 They say that money seems to be spent 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.380
 a lot of time and nerves spent a lot 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 pay dress without mood and then 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.259
 you hang it in the closet and never again 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.090
 dressing up here is a very common question 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 the problem of this it concerns it often 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.970
 appears before the new year 1 option 2 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.590
 option is before the summer season too 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.850
 Itself goes because it is season 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.930
 graduation weddings active yes when 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.189

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.890
 respectively pictures 1 what we see 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.380
 evening dress black is relevant 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.300
 always up 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.430
 lace inserts due to this arm 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 get see you think hands 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.590
 closed 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.650
 lace seems to be a sleeve but he is not 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.320
 tightly closed ladies such from another 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.370
 the sides of the neckline don't seem very deep 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.740
 because of the lace inserts sing and moment 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.570
 embroidery 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.640
 She then goes on the neckline and on 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.150
 hips and fourth moment one of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.360
 directions yes it is cutouts and cut 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.790
 diverse on the dresses next let's 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 we'll see 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.610
 picture 2 please put pluses 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.790
 if the picture has loaded here already 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.720
 evening cocktail dress 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.360
 dress to the floor 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.330
 cocktail dresses knee one knee 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.250
 MDA right behind the knee is the length here what 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.740
 there will be black too the first moment 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.100
 second moment 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.780
 lace she creates the illusion that 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.760
 visible body and third moment embroidery 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.780
 That is, it is the same as it will be relevant. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.550
 in the next few years this is an option 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.230
 cocktail dress with one hand you 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.930
 look due to the fact that it is tight 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.820
 closed she seems to be modest 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.410
 but on the other hand due to the fact that 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.989
 lace inserts so it seems naked 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.450
 the body shines through and due to this 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.030
 it gives the image of erotica defined then 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.450
 there seems to be it tightly closed I'm but with 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.230
 the other side of it is somehow boring up 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.940
 faceless uninteresting can not be called 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.010
 only he has certain mouth 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.450
 look in evening dresses especially this 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.320
 relevant and in cocktail dresses and 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.090
 evening dresses 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.950
 lest clothing should hint she 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.019
 must show and open all she 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.370
 should hint and that in the previous 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.230
 dress up what's up 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.480
 that you must be open for something 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.950
 closed you have to be hint in clothes 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.950
