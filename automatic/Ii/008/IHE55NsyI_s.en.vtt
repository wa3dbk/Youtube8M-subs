my method of making a three break show
or<00:00:05.339> any<00:00:05.370> kind<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.790> modal<00:00:06.089> break<00:00:06.270> shell

or any kind of a modal break shell
differs<00:00:06.960> slightly<00:00:07.890> from<00:00:08.160> most<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.940> ones

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
differs slightly from most of the ones

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.650 
differs slightly from most of the ones
that<00:00:09.150> I've<00:00:09.330> seen<00:00:11.120> most<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> times<00:00:12.480> you've

seen a multiple break shell most of the
time<00:00:14.400> they<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> real<00:00:15.150> nice<00:00:15.299> big<00:00:15.540> break

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750

tend to shoot out the end they get they
deteriorate<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.630> they<00:00:24.720> go<00:00:24.840> down<00:00:24.869> well<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
deteriorate as they go down well way I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.720 
deteriorate as they go down well way I
do<00:00:26.250> mine<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.960> make<00:00:27.960> them<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.699> like<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
do mine I make them all as a like a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.840 
do mine I make them all as a like a
single<00:00:30.060> break<00:00:30.210> shell<00:00:30.449> i<00:00:31.309> String<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.340> paste<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
single break shell i String it paste it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.639 
single break shell i String it paste it
just<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> regular<00:00:33.420> shell<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.410> join

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
just like a regular shell then I join

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.910 
just like a regular shell then I join
them<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:34.890> together<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> plug<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:36.920> this

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
them all together with the plug now this

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.630 
them all together with the plug now this
gives<00:00:38.100> integrity<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.910> shell<00:00:39.210> makes<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
gives integrity to the shell makes it a

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.160 
gives integrity to the shell makes it a
much<00:00:41.640> harder<00:00:41.910> break<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.930> breaks

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
much harder break and all the breaks

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.280 
much harder break and all the breaks
look<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> same

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.830 

pull<00:00:48.920> it<00:00:49.040> tight<00:00:49.250> work<00:00:50.150> all<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.420> air<00:00:50.510> bubbles

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
pull it tight work all the air bubbles

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.420 
pull it tight work all the air bubbles
out<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:51.080> it<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.470> just<00:00:51.740> roll<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:52.100> up<00:00:54.340> there<00:00:55.340> we

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
out of it and just roll it up there we

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.270 
out of it and just roll it up there we
got<00:00:55.550> one<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:55.940> half<00:00:55.970> turns<00:00:56.360> on<00:00:56.600> there<00:00:57.280> are

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
got one and a half turns on there are

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.940 
got one and a half turns on there are
actually<00:00:58.610> about<00:00:58.700> one-third<00:00:59.950> two-thirds

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
actually about one-third two-thirds

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.630 
actually about one-third two-thirds
maybe<00:01:02.770> now<00:01:03.770> normally<00:01:03.950> we<00:01:04.250> will<00:01:04.339> be<00:01:04.430> setting

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
maybe now normally we will be setting

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.890 
maybe now normally we will be setting
this<00:01:04.760> aside<00:01:05.120> a<00:01:05.540> day<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.930> dry<00:01:07.510> so<00:01:08.510> that<00:01:08.690> you

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
this aside a day to dry so that you

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.810 
this aside a day to dry so that you
won't<00:01:09.080> won't<00:01:09.710> get<00:01:09.920> pasted<00:01:10.370> in<00:01:10.520> airing<00:01:10.729> all

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
won't won't get pasted in airing all

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.040 
won't won't get pasted in airing all
over<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.150> which<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.330> what's<00:01:11.750> going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.960> happen

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
over you which is what's going to happen

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:20.320 
over you which is what's going to happen
now

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.670 

and<00:01:20.930> they<00:01:21.020> can<00:01:21.170> tend<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.410> be<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> little

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
and they can tend to be a little

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.190 
and they can tend to be a little
slippery<00:01:22.010> now<00:01:23.200> what<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.290> do<00:01:24.350> mind<00:01:26.020> some<00:01:27.020> other

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
slippery now what I do mind some other

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.720 
slippery now what I do mind some other
people<00:01:27.470> I've<00:01:27.590> seen<00:01:27.830> they<00:01:28.160> take<00:01:28.370> one<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.670> these

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
people I've seen they take one of these

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.640 
people I've seen they take one of these
pieces<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.210> match<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:29.900> put<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.440> side

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
pieces of match now put it on the side

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.590 
pieces of match now put it on the side
like<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:31.210> all<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.270> take<00:01:32.600> two<00:01:32.980> doesn't<00:01:33.980> hurt

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
like that all I take two doesn't hurt

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.060 
like that all I take two doesn't hurt
like<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.690> said<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:35.960> very<00:01:36.140> cheap<00:01:36.380> insurance

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.170 

and<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.220> got<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.460> check<00:01:40.610> your<00:01:40.790> dexterity

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
and you got to check your dexterity

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.730 
and you got to check your dexterity
because<00:01:41.630> sometimes<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.200> hard<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.440> hold<00:01:42.560> it

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
because sometimes it's hard to hold it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.960 
because sometimes it's hard to hold it
up<00:01:42.830> there<00:01:42.860> while<00:01:43.250> you're<00:01:43.400> trying<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.730> tie<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
up there while you're trying to tie the

00:01:43.970 --> 00:02:03.630 
up there while you're trying to tie the
night

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
and I take a few turns around there to

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.050 
and I take a few turns around there to
make<00:02:06.070> sure<00:02:06.130> everything's<00:02:06.520> nice<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.700> tight

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.770 
make sure everything's nice and tight
and<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.360> tie<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.570> off<00:02:07.780> again<00:02:09.390> okay<00:02:10.390> who<00:02:10.539> wants<00:02:10.630> to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.690 
and I tie it off again okay who wants to
carry<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.110> around<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> finished

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
carry this around there it is a finished

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.210 
carry this around there it is a finished
