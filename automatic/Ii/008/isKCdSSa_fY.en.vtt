00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.240
 hello videos from youtube we are in canary 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.330
 tech and today we bring you 5 things for the 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.159
 that you do not buy the sony xperia z 1 no 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.009
 forget to follow us in our networks 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:16.299
 social twitter and facebook and now if 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.299
 let's go with the video 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.510
 the aspect of the economy was improved 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.550
 ceta al z1 but still not quite 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 comfortable having the experience is one in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.930
 hand in the market there are several 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 examples of devices with better 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.370
 ergonomics since they have the part of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.830
 back with a little curve so that it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 adapts to the hand this depends on what 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.840
 are you used and maybe for you 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 do not be inconvenient 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.030
 although the camera offers some photos with 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
 very good resolution the photos in low 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.220
 light are pretty decent that's why 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.160
 surely you will have heard from 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.130
 many experts that a camera are not 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.180
 only megapixels since there are many 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.640
 factors that influence when taking a photo 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.400
 the full hd screen from the z1 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.470
 simply staying behind the rest is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.990
 practically the same as your 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.120
 predecessor the whites could be a 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.060
 little more pure and viewing angles 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.700
 Screen leave much to be desired the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.820
 hesperia z1 only comes with a memory 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.400
 internal 16 gigabytes although it has a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.400
 microsd card slot that you 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.960
 allows to expand the storage but 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.119
 I think that should not put it to the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.229
 provision of users a version 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.229
 of 32 gb 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.410
 and finally and it may be one of the 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.390
 reasons that throw you back is the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.000
 risk of breakage of the caps of the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.490
 device once again has returned to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.930
 get better but I still have a bit of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.300
 suspicion in regard to its 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 durability since it looks like 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.280
 any confusion can end with 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.530
 them and here's the video today if you 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.270
 liked it like and subscribe for 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.270
 more until the next video
