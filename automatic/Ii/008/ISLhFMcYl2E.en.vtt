arm and got this medicine that's slowly

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090 
arm and got this medicine that's slowly
leaking<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.870> keeping<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.469> numb<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
leaking in there keeping me numb so that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.910 
leaking in there keeping me numb so that
I<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.550> hit<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> physical<00:00:40.530> therapy

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I can really hit the physical therapy

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
I can really hit the physical therapy
hard<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.500> stretching<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.649> arm<00:00:44.780> let's<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
hard and stretching my arm let's take a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
hard and stretching my arm let's take a
look<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:48.350> where<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.500> four<00:00:50.160> days<00:00:50.370> from

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
look at where we are four days from

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
look at where we are four days from
surgery<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.530> i<00:00:58.590> marked

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
surgery this is just where i marked

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
surgery this is just where i marked
where<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.000> arm<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.750> red<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
where I the arm was a little red and I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
where I the arm was a little red and I
thought<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> might<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.890> infected<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.670> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
thought it might be infected but it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.390 
thought it might be infected but it's
not<00:01:03.120> red<00:01:03.390> anymore<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> don't<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
not red anymore so I don't think I have

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.609 
not red anymore so I don't think I have
to<00:01:05.489> worry<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:09.380> there<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.470> two

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
to worry about that there are two

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.789 
to worry about that there are two
incisions<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.640> lower<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.799> was

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
incisions the lower one over here was

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
incisions the lower one over here was
where<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.580> surgeon<00:01:15.090> went<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> removed
