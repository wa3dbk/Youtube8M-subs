00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.710
 the assessment we have so far is very positive on Tuesday 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.810
 It was a day of professional visit and collectors is the first time 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.760
 we were doing a specific day make this kind of public and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.890
 it worked very well the first operations were already made 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.060
 the galleries valued very much that collectors could have the 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.320
 enough tranquility to be able to walk around and contemplate the offer 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 adequately yesterday was the first day of opening to the public and even though the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 climatological weather did not accompany much also 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 especially in the afternoon we already had a large influx of public 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.580
 for everything we have done 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 is to reinforce our program and nothing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 of consecutive year is dedicated to galleries and artists 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.940
 well young 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.060
 we have reinforced with a program that we have called arzo in which we have 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.480
 given entrance to the artistic installations proposed by the galleries 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.340
 participants and selected by the committees 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.950
 dish so I said to complete a bit the offer we had 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.520
 the fleece until this is a program that has great acceptance 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.820
 by the public and that we also want to give much more relevance in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.649
 the future and strengthen our support for young Spanish artists 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 your ancestors 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.679
 we are willing 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:14.959
 these events 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.539
 your wives 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:18.789
 his excesses 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.629
 your advisors 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.010
 is a priority for the promotion of contemporary Spanish art 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.109
 More than 90% of the participating galleries are Spanish galleries 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.020
 and it's a very easy way 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.570
 and simple to know practically all the Spanish creation of the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.280
 last 50 years from the historical avant-garde to the most recent creations 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.370
 Current processing is the main difference between us 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.470
