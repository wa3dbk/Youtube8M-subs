00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 blue checkered or pink but lined 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.609
 hÃ¼hner the question was so far from me 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.189
 nobody answers then i will 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.550
 Certainly not be the first one for that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.550
 you do 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.350
 hello hello now what do you want in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.000
 you have everything to achieve your life 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.930
 you made you anything solid 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.220
 I still live in my life 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.509
 nothing is achieved because of this there is still 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.689
 pretty much what i want to do i want 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.640
 I would like to graduate first 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 somehow study something and finished 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 that's what I think is the first thing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 I want to do what I want 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 always wants to achieve in life 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.699
 actually not more because of course 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 find a cool job 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.640
 yes you believe in ghosts I do not know 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.199
 It is a nice idea that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 So there are not so many spirits 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.620
 ghosts or something and not 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.239
 somehow the old relatives are the ones 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.610
 all the time around you are flying in the animal 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.339
 to look what do you do that i would be one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.110
 Bit weird but I had it earlier 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.729
 I once had ghosts called fixie 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.110
 trick him into the ko and ghost and the 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.930
 were always around me i know too 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.720
 not why i was a funny kid 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 yes what first for music and do you think so 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 I'll give you a song that will live 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.750
 I just describe that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 music video arrives 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.980
 Do you recognize a few of the audience fans 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.780
 you on twitter or other platforms 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.370
 definitely on twitter in any case and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.960
 on instagram not synonymous 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.740
 more the fanpages or people who mean 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.230
 Names as name know what I mean 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.720
 There are actually more and more people 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.130
 Write to me is something 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.450
 everything becomes more difficult too 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 see and answer but there is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.870
 Still, many still 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.850
 I always recognize 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.740
 For example, this fedex got this time 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.640
 you are the closest friends 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.010
 if you ever refresh some youtube 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 have from dancing if you have any 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.150
 youtuber who does not know personally 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.500
 could meet is what would it be sick 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.050
 I would like to get to know you from 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.340
 the German youtube otherwise 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.409
 actually only English and would have too 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.030
 right bock with the English youtuber 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.009
 to do something as it is in the video 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.420
 it would be totally stupid 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.769
 because then it would have to be in English 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.690
 because the person does not understand 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.970
 German that would me in principle 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.349
 bring nothing but subscribers then 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.060
 from this English youtube falls on 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.290
 come over it 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.390
 that's why it's not that smart because that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.040
 cool again as much as I want 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.290
 no video metals open but share 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.220
 make sure left or so eller 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.010
 alfi hannah hanna hannah had the dignity 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 I like to see it so it gives up 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.709
 every case many of the English 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.330
 youtube to which I'm pretty interesting 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.270
 find 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 but I believe that someday 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.990
 It will happen that her end found him 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.490
 You meet up in Cologne and can 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.450
 me with an invitation to 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.300
 housewarming expects frank 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.310
 I actually found a flat 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.930
 has taken a long long time 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.550
 I had to do it really hard 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.440
 I say so in retrospect I have in 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.790
 I have the time in the application phase 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.900
 learned a lot about how to 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.310
 to apply correctly 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.390
 what you should do what you do not 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 I should do that now 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.060
 and now the end is really good 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.380
 works and now I have 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.580
 actually just a flat 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.730
 that is totally great 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.950
 I will then go to Cologne for the april 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.510
 pull in a really cool against joy 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.209
 The apartment is small 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.580
 that's why I probably like to be 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.500
 party will 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.420
 but when i live in cologne frank there 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.069
 Of course I like to invite you 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.709
 a beer to all of me and then 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.720
 several of us put in a little until then 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.800
 In this room , air can be more in it 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.810
 because we worked so fast away 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.640
 because they are so small then go 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.340
 we can somehow get out then 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.230
 again out there what do you like to do 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.060
 are you with your current life 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.709
 would you be satisfied or would you like something? 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.819
 change if you could i would just 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.640
 nothing at all 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.049
 I am really satisfied that is 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.609
 somehow kouchner i do not know me 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.989
 I'm not where I am 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.480
 thought before, I was not five 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.280
 years where I am today but it is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.989
 somehow so strong so i know i am 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.239
 really happy and i have just 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.620
 cool friends I never have anything to 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.780
 I have you the youtube 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.519
 historical out there but if 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.290
 It totally 90 sounds like shit 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.380
 but it is still something special 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.299
 if you can barely intervene 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.549
 because they are so fast 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.000
 now and say that in the next 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.000
 Video
