00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
way basically if you right-click on the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729 
way basically if you right-click on the
pressure<00:00:44.309> plate<00:00:44.480> armor<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:46.379> change

whether they stalk you that is basically

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.439 
whether they stalk you that is basically

building a house in you after all you're
building<00:02:05.360> materials<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.259> then<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.280> want<00:02:07.460> to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
building materials and then you want to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.040 
building materials and then you want to
do<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.759> decorating<00:02:08.239> but<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:08.660> might<00:02:08.840> need<00:02:08.989> to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
do the decorating but you might need to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.229 
do the decorating but you might need to
build<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.440> material<00:02:09.950> still<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.670> can<00:02:10.820> actually

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
build a material still you can actually

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.840 
build a material still you can actually
save<00:02:11.660> them<00:02:11.959> as<00:02:12.170> preset<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.070> like<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.700> for

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
save them as preset so like just for

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.090 
save them as preset so like just for

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.130 
right i'm going to show you quickly
briefly<00:03:46.260> how<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.340> actually<00:03:47.700> works<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.750> i'm

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
briefly how this actually works so i'm

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.680 
briefly how this actually works so i'm
going<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.320> set<00:03:49.800> another<00:03:52.610> another<00:03:53.610> way<00:03:54.329> point

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
going to set another another way point

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.750 
going to set another another way point
right<00:03:54.900> here<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.380> press<00:03:55.650> M<00:03:55.890> that's<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.579> hot

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
right here so you press M that's the hot

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.789 
right here so you press M that's the hot
key<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.120> activate<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.590> where

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
key to activate it and to do where

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.289 
key to activate it and to do where
points<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.220> hit<00:03:59.579> where<00:03:59.790> point<00:04:00.060> there's

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
points you just hit where point there's

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.000 
points you just hit where point there's
loads<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.570> options<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:00.989> E<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.410> take<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> look<00:04:01.860> if

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
loads of options in E so take a look if

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.819 
loads of options in E so take a look if
you<00:04:02.100> install<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.810> then<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.320> add<00:04:04.470> a

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
you install it and then I can add a

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.280 
you install it and then I can add a
waypoint<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.489> i'm<00:04:05.610> going<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.850> call<00:04:06.090> this

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
waypoint a and i'm going to call this

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.070 
waypoint a and i'm going to call this
pond

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
pond

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.170 
pond
that's<00:04:08.380> what<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.100> i'll<00:04:09.790> change<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
that's what it is and i'll change the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.590 
that's what it is and i'll change the
color<00:04:10.570> yellow<00:04:11.410> do<00:04:11.800> then<00:04:12.160> press<00:04:12.490> ok<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.270> tight

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
color yellow do then press ok and tight

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.850 
color yellow do then press ok and tight
and<00:04:14.460> push<00:04:15.460> it<00:04:15.670> wrong<00:04:16.330> one<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.810> that's<00:04:17.680> it

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
and push it wrong one and that's it

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.250 
and push it wrong one and that's it
basically<00:04:18.459> so<00:04:19.239> now<00:04:19.420> when<00:04:19.540> i<00:04:19.600> moved<00:04:19.780> back<00:04:19.900> it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
basically so now when i moved back it

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.650 
basically so now when i moved back it
was<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.380> waypoint<00:04:20.620> they're<00:04:21.040> called<00:04:21.400> Connie

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.570 

fitter<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.760> any<00:04:26.760> way<00:04:26.910> let's<00:04:27.180> go<00:04:27.420> on<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.780> mod<00:04:28.020> for

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.040 

we're<00:04:32.580> back<00:04:32.760> for<00:04:32.970> what<00:04:33.090> for<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.840> is

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
we're back for what for and this is

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.660 
we're back for what for and this is
called<00:04:34.350> shell<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:35.070> one<00:04:35.190> point<00:04:35.430> three<00:04:35.490> point

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
called shell for one point three point

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.970 
called shell for one point three point
one<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.660> basically<00:04:36.960> allows<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.800> to

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980
