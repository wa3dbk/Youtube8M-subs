to find Kevin Durant out there since he

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.659

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
is on fire look at him 23 points and

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.670 
is on fire look at him 23 points and
definitely<00:03:41.239> almost<00:03:41.510> perfect<00:03:42.200> from<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.410> field

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
definitely almost perfect from the field

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.740 
definitely almost perfect from the field
but<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.459> pretty<00:03:43.700> much<00:03:43.940> Kevin<00:03:44.209> Durant<00:03:44.569> out

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750

to be a little

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.510 
to be a little
bit<00:06:34.729> better<00:06:34.939> in<00:06:35.360> NBA<00:06:35.750> 2k16<00:06:36.289> but<00:06:37.219> it's<00:06:37.340> worth

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
bit better in NBA 2k16 but it's worth

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.610 
bit better in NBA 2k16 but it's worth
going<00:06:37.639> up<00:06:37.849> against<00:06:38.150> white<00:06:38.360> Howard<00:06:38.810> oh<00:06:38.990> I<00:06:39.050> wish

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
going up against white Howard oh I wish

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.929 
going up against white Howard oh I wish
that<00:06:39.860> would<00:06:40.009> have<00:06:40.099> been<00:06:40.219> opposed<00:06:40.490> to<00:06:40.580> rising

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:40.939 
that would have been opposed to rising

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:42.730 
that would have been opposed to rising
dunk<00:06:41.270> but<00:06:41.659> we<00:06:41.780> got<00:06:41.930> a<00:06:41.960> lift<00:06:42.259> with<00:06:42.439> the<00:06:42.469> layup

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
dunk but we got a lift with the layup

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.800 
dunk but we got a lift with the layup
right<00:06:42.979> there<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.580> look<00:06:43.849> at<00:06:43.969> us<00:06:44.090> we<00:06:44.419> get<00:06:44.569> this

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
right there and look at us we get this

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.050 
right there and look at us we get this
deal<00:06:45.139> I<00:06:45.469> think<00:06:45.889> that<00:06:46.039> counts<00:06:46.250> into<00:06:46.669> a<00:06:46.729> smack<00:06:47.030> in

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
deal I think that counts into a smack in

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.330 
deal I think that counts into a smack in
your<00:06:47.389> face<00:06:47.599> Dwight<00:06:47.930> Howard<00:06:48.409> look<00:06:48.800> right<00:06:49.039> there

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
your face Dwight Howard look right there

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.850 
your face Dwight Howard look right there
that<00:06:49.669> is<00:06:49.789> definitely<00:06:50.180> a<00:06:50.270> flop<00:06:50.840> why<00:06:51.439> didn't<00:06:51.770> we

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
that is definitely a flop why didn't we

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.040 
that is definitely a flop why didn't we
go<00:06:52.039> for<00:06:52.310> the<00:06:52.370> free<00:06:52.520> throw<00:06:52.550> line<00:06:52.759> dunk<00:06:53.360> and<00:06:53.599> went

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
go for the free throw line dunk and went

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.320
