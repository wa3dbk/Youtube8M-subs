suppose and I thought that I could pull

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.520 
suppose and I thought that I could pull
off<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:32.719> doing<00:00:33.719> spore<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.530> editing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
off a doing spore and the and editing

the<00:00:37.559> footage<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.190> recorded<00:00:38.670> last<00:00:38.910> night<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.800> me

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the footage I recorded last night of me

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.000 
the footage I recorded last night of me
doing<00:00:41.160> stage<00:00:41.640> 15<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.600> well<00:00:42.809> from<00:00:43.170> stage<00:00:43.469> 11<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
doing stage 15 and well from stage 11 to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
doing stage 15 and well from stage 11 to
15<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.550> thought<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.059> could<00:00:45.300> edit<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> footage

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
15 I thought I could edit that footage

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
15 I thought I could edit that footage
and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.860> could<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.379> well<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> ran<00:00:50.219> out

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and I could do for as well but I ran out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.930 
and I could do for as well but I ran out
of<00:00:50.489> time<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:53.780> instead<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> be

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
of time so instead it's just going to be

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
of time so instead it's just going to be
a<00:00:56.940> Minecraft<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> be

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
like I kind of stopped recording when I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.530 
like I kind of stopped recording when I
was<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.229> repeating<00:01:31.799> stuff<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.240> get

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
was like repeating stuff and then I get

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.649 
was like repeating stuff and then I get
to<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> new<00:01:33.869> stuff<00:01:34.079> I'd<00:01:34.290> start<00:01:34.530> recording<00:01:34.770> again

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
to a new stuff I'd start recording again

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.330 
to a new stuff I'd start recording again
and<00:01:36.659> sometimes<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:37.860> recording<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and sometimes I was just recording the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.649 
and sometimes I was just recording the
whole<00:01:38.430> time<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.790> anyway<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.329> point<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
whole time but anyway so the point is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.380 
whole time but anyway so the point is
that<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.700> hour<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.909> 14

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that I that it was like an hour and 14

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.550 
that I that it was like an hour and 14
minutes<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.720> footage<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.200> had<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.439> edit

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
minutes of footage that I had to edit

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460 
minutes of footage that I had to edit
and<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.880> concentrated<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> half<00:01:46.320> an

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and it's concentrated down to half an

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.690 
and it's concentrated down to half an
hour<00:01:46.700> honestly<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:49.110> feel<00:01:49.740> personally<00:01:50.340> like

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
