00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 

at<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.300> time<00:01:30.540> before<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.380> load<00:01:31.650> yes

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
at a time before they get to load yes

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
at a time before they get to load yes
why<00:01:33.120> not<00:01:33.150> attacks<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.720> melons<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.380> have

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
why not attacks of melons will you have

why not attacks of melons will you have
a<00:01:34.650> fair<00:01:34.890> time<00:01:35.390> when<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.540> practice

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.190 

so<00:01:40.180> another<00:01:40.420> cool<00:01:40.600> thing<00:01:40.659> about<00:01:40.870> these

so another cool thing about these

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.480 
so another cool thing about these
control<00:01:41.680> schemes<00:01:41.950> they're<00:01:42.310> all

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
control schemes they're all

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.910 
control schemes they're all
cross-compatible<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.620> can<00:01:44.770> actually

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920

and<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:17.379> there<00:02:18.870> what's<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.989> reason<00:02:20.260> why<00:02:20.290> it

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
and so is there what's the reason why it

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.050 
and so is there what's the reason why it
doesn't<00:02:20.890> work<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> original<00:02:21.760> version

move<00:02:27.730> technology<00:02:28.299> didn't<00:02:28.569> exist<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:29.109> there

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
move technology didn't exist so there

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.660 
move technology didn't exist so there

Edition Mars II didn't know about the
move<00:02:37.599> technology<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.379> they<00:02:38.470> were<00:02:38.530> able<00:02:38.739> to

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
move technology so they were able to

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.990 
move technology so they were able to
implement<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:39.459> onto<00:02:39.790> disk<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.709> many<00:02:42.000> imagine

implement that onto disk so many imagine

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.670 
implement that onto disk so many imagine
that<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.239> probably<00:02:43.599> played<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.049> thing<00:02:44.109> like

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
that you probably played this thing like

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.970 
that you probably played this thing like
non-stop<00:02:45.489> since<00:02:46.260> PlayStation<00:02:47.260> Move<00:02:47.409> has<00:02:47.739> been

non-stop since PlayStation Move has been
in<00:02:48.400> development<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:49.470> compare<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.680> your

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
in development and compare that to your

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.009 
in development and compare that to your
experience<00:02:51.579> playing<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.090> originally<00:02:52.540> with<00:02:52.989> a

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
experience playing it originally with a

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.539 
experience playing it originally with a
regular<00:02:53.470> controller<00:02:53.859> does<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.220> affect<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
regular controller does it affect the

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.979 
regular controller does it affect the
pacing<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.180> game<00:02:55.269> can<00:02:55.629> you<00:02:55.659> play<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.930> like

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
pacing of the game can you play it like

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.470 
pacing of the game can you play it like
faster<00:02:56.709> does<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.849> make<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.239> little<00:02:58.269> bit

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
faster does it make it a little bit

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.229 
faster does it make it a little bit
easier<00:02:58.959> how<00:02:59.319> does<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.590> compare<00:02:59.790> for<00:03:00.790> me<00:03:00.939> I

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
easier how does it compare for me I

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.640 
easier how does it compare for me I
think<00:03:01.359> it's<00:03:01.689> a<00:03:01.780> little<00:03:01.900> bit<00:03:02.169> easier

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
think it's a little bit easier

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.399 
think it's a little bit easier
because<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.790> find<00:03:04.299> myself<00:03:04.510> being<00:03:04.780> able<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.200> aim

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
because I find myself being able to aim

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.170 
because I find myself being able to aim
a<00:03:05.439> little<00:03:05.680> bit<00:03:05.889> more<00:03:06.040> precisely<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.939> a<00:03:07.000> little

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
a little bit more precisely and a little

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.210 
a little bit more precisely and a little
bit<00:03:07.299> faster<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.379> actually<00:03:08.590> prefer<00:03:09.069> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
bit faster so I actually prefer the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.949 
bit faster so I actually prefer the
control<00:03:09.609> squeezes<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.269> feel<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.629> little<00:03:10.750> bit

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
control squeezes I feel a little bit

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.629 
control squeezes I feel a little bit
more<00:03:11.169> engaged<00:03:11.500> when<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.769> actually<00:03:12.010> have<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.459> aim

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
more engaged when I actually have to aim

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.780 
more engaged when I actually have to aim
something<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.239> screen<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.220> all<00:03:15.549> in<00:03:15.669> all<00:03:15.760> I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
something at the screen and all in all I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.479 
something at the screen and all in all I
think<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:16.150> works<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:17.049> motion<00:03:17.919> controls<00:03:18.250> work

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
think it works the motion controls work

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:33.930 
think it works the motion controls work
really<00:03:18.669> well<00:03:18.879> for<00:03:18.939> Resident<00:03:19.810> Evil<00:03:19.989> 5

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.240 

alright<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:34.780> zero<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.590> your<00:03:35.770> experience<00:03:36.130> is

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
alright and zero in your experience is

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.890 
alright and zero in your experience is
there<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> particular<00:03:36.760> weapon<00:03:37.240> that<00:03:37.750> works

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
there a particular weapon that works

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.860 
there a particular weapon that works
best<00:03:38.140> with<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.530> booth<00:03:38.800> controller<00:03:39.720> they<00:03:40.720> all

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
best with the booth controller they all

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.260 
best with the booth controller they all
work<00:03:41.110> very<00:03:41.410> well<00:03:41.490> one<00:03:42.490> of<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.610> cool<00:03:42.820> things<00:03:43.060> in

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
work very well one of the cool things in

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.790 
work very well one of the cool things in
with<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> shotgun<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.110> can<00:03:44.260> actually<00:03:44.590> see

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
with the shotgun you can actually see

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.750 
with the shotgun you can actually see
the<00:03:44.860> blast<00:03:45.190> radius

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
the blast radius

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.820 
the blast radius
oh<00:03:46.020> when<00:03:47.020> you<00:03:47.110> fire<00:03:47.320> it<00:03:47.350> enemies<00:03:51.780> have

the giant executioner okay every time I

the giant executioner okay every time I
have<00:03:59.270> made<00:03:59.540> quite<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.870> lot<00:04:00.080> when<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.290> was<00:04:00.470> right

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.550 

and<00:04:06.790> how<00:04:07.150> does<00:04:07.270> it<00:04:07.390> work<00:04:07.540> with<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.170> puzzle

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560

everything<00:04:11.500> works<00:04:11.710> just<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.100> same<00:04:12.160> yeah<00:04:12.700> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
everything works just the same yeah the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.670 
everything works just the same yeah the
new<00:04:13.540> move<00:04:13.780> button<00:04:14.020> in<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.230> middle<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.590> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
new move button in the middle of the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.920 
new move button in the middle of the
controller<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.250> pretty<00:04:15.460> nice<00:04:15.640> because<00:04:15.940> they

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
controller is pretty nice because they

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.979 
controller is pretty nice because they
remapped<00:04:17.380> all<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.830> all<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.940> action<00:04:19.300> buttons

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
remapped all the all the action buttons

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.840 
remapped all the all the action buttons
to<00:04:20.140> that<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:20.890> it<00:04:21.010> sits<00:04:21.220> right<00:04:21.459> nicely

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
to that so it sits right nicely

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.040 
to that so it sits right nicely
underneath<00:04:22.150> your<00:04:22.300> thumb<00:04:22.480> it's<00:04:22.720> kind<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:22.960> like

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
underneath your thumb it's kind of like

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.220 
underneath your thumb it's kind of like
your<00:04:23.170> default<00:04:23.560> button<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.070> go<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.730> I<00:04:25.110> like<00:04:26.110> I

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
your default button to go to so I like I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.660 
your default button to go to so I like I
really<00:04:26.260> like<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.770> way<00:04:26.890> that<00:04:26.920> they<00:04:27.130> design<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
really like the way that they design the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.220 
really like the way that they design the
mood<00:04:28.150> controller<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.750> can<00:04:28.780> really<00:04:29.110> hit

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
mood controller you can really hit

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.890 
mood controller you can really hit
everything<00:04:29.650> very<00:04:29.800> easily<00:04:30.040> with<00:04:30.370> your<00:04:30.520> thumb

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.390 

there's<00:04:34.900> actually<00:04:35.320> two<00:04:35.740> control<00:04:36.130> schemes

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
there's actually two control schemes

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.760 
there's actually two control schemes
that<00:04:36.550> are<00:04:36.610> included<00:04:37.350> right<00:04:38.350> now<00:04:38.470> I'm<00:04:38.650> using

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
that are included right now I'm using

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.320 
that are included right now I'm using
the<00:04:39.010> next<00:04:39.250> button<00:04:39.550> on<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.760> mood<00:04:39.940> controller

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the next button on the mood controller

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.900 
the next button on the mood controller
to<00:04:40.570> run<00:04:41.250> if<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.430> doesn't<00:04:42.760> feel<00:04:42.850> natural

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
to run if that doesn't feel natural

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.580 
to run if that doesn't feel natural
there's<00:04:43.480> also<00:04:43.630> another<00:04:43.930> one<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.230> switches

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
there's also another one that switches

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.950 
there's also another one that switches
the<00:04:45.160> running<00:04:45.910> controls<00:04:46.270> over<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.780> nav

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
the running controls over to the nav

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.230 
the running controls over to the nav
controller

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
controller

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.840 
controller
now<00:04:50.240> was<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.660> always<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.340> do<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.430> know<00:04:52.520> was<00:04:52.730> it

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
now was it always the do you know was it

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.760 
now was it always the do you know was it
always<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.240> intention<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.930> support<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
always the intention to support the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.560 
always the intention to support the
Knapp<00:04:54.950> controller<00:04:55.400> as<00:04:55.610> well<00:04:55.880> or<00:04:56.150> were<00:04:56.420> they

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
Knapp controller as well or were they

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.630 
Knapp controller as well or were they
tinkering<00:04:57.200> with<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.440> concept<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:57.980> just<00:04:58.340> using

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
tinkering with the concept of just using

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.080 
tinkering with the concept of just using
the<00:04:58.910> new<00:04:59.270> controller<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:01.490> really<00:05:01.790> need<00:05:01.970> two

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
the new controller you really need two

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.300 
the new controller you really need two
analog<00:05:02.480> sticks<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:02.930> move<00:05:03.080> around<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:03.650> they<00:05:03.950> it

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
analog sticks to move around so they it

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.980 
analog sticks to move around so they it
always<00:05:04.580> always<00:05:05.090> was<00:05:05.480> going<00:05:05.630> to<00:05:05.690> require

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
always always was going to require

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.050 
always always was going to require
something<00:05:06.290> with<00:05:06.530> an<00:05:06.620> analog<00:05:06.980> stick<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.880> game

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
something with an analog stick the game

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.990 
something with an analog stick the game
does<00:05:08.300> support<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:10.250> Knapp<00:05:10.430> controller<00:05:10.820> as

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
does support the Knapp controller as

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.280 
does support the Knapp controller as
well<00:05:11.210> as<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.420> Dual<00:05:11.570> Shock<00:05:11.630> so<00:05:11.960> if<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.140> don't

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
well as the Dual Shock so if you don't

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.990 
well as the Dual Shock so if you don't
have<00:05:12.440> captain<00:05:12.860> app<00:05:12.980> controller<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.640> still

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
have captain app controller it still

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.390 
have captain app controller it still
works<00:05:14.180> perfectly<00:05:14.330> fine<00:05:14.720> okay<00:05:15.380> but<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:16.070> analog

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
works perfectly fine okay but the analog

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.890 
works perfectly fine okay but the analog
stick<00:05:16.670> is<00:05:16.700> very<00:05:17.000> essential<00:05:17.270> remove<00:05:17.690> all<00:05:18.440> right
