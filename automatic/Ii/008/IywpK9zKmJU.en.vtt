00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.040 
and I can't process all these toxins
fast<00:01:59.600> enough<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.790> it's<00:02:01.790> your<00:02:02.000> body's<00:02:02.330> reaction

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
fast enough so it's your body's reaction

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.380 
fast enough so it's your body's reaction
to<00:02:03.250> things<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.610> doesn't<00:02:04.880> want<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.180> it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
to things that it doesn't want that it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.920 
to things that it doesn't want that it
can't<00:02:05.930> utilize<00:02:06.530> for<00:02:07.250> fuel<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.880> energy<00:02:08.510> and

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
can't utilize for fuel and energy and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.440 
can't utilize for fuel and energy and
for<00:02:09.200> rebuilding<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.710> body<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.670> anything<00:02:11.210> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
for rebuilding the body so anything the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.350 
for rebuilding the body so anything the
body<00:02:11.660> can't<00:02:11.960> use<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:13.010> either<00:02:13.250> break<00:02:13.880> down<00:02:14.090> old

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
body can't use to either break down old

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.260 
body can't use to either break down old
tissues<00:02:14.810> or<00:02:14.990> rebuild<00:02:15.440> new<00:02:15.620> tissues<00:02:16.270> it's

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
tissues or rebuild new tissues it's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210 
tissues or rebuild new tissues it's
toxic<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.960> body<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.260> ultimately<00:02:18.770> causes

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
toxic to the body and ultimately causes

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.190 
toxic to the body and ultimately causes
inflammation<00:02:19.490> which<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.240> ultimately<00:02:20.630> leads

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
inflammation which then ultimately leads

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.990 
inflammation which then ultimately leads
to<00:02:21.320> disease<00:02:21.920> process<00:02:22.430> let's<00:02:22.700> look<00:02:22.790> at<00:02:22.940> an

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
to disease process let's look at an

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.050 
to disease process let's look at an
example<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.750> body<00:02:24.260> can't<00:02:24.500> process<00:02:24.940> some<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
example of a body can't process some of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.000 
example of a body can't process some of
the<00:02:26.120> body<00:02:26.300> can't<00:02:26.510> process<00:02:26.660> yeah<00:02:26.990> well<00:02:27.620> you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the body can't process yeah well you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.430 
the body can't process yeah well you
know<00:02:28.040> interested<00:02:28.910> though<00:02:29.060> well<00:02:29.780> there's<00:02:30.050> all

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
know interested though well there's all

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.410 
know interested though well there's all
those<00:02:30.680> processed<00:02:31.280> foods<00:02:31.550> all<00:02:31.760> those<00:02:31.940> names<00:02:32.180> on

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
those processed foods all those names on

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.150 
those processed foods all those names on
the<00:02:32.510> packages<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.440> can't<00:02:33.950> even

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
the packages that you can't even

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.740 
the packages that you can't even
pronounce<00:02:34.370> if<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.940> can't<00:02:35.180> pronounce<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
pronounce if you can't pronounce it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.320 
pronounce if you can't pronounce it
though<00:02:36.050> your<00:02:36.290> body<00:02:36.470> can't<00:02:36.710> use<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.370> that's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
though your body can't use it so that's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.120 
though your body can't use it so that's
a<00:02:38.420> good<00:02:38.450> rule<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> thumb<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.740> can't

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
a good rule of thumb if you can't

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.120 
a good rule of thumb if you can't
pronounce<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.700> don't<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.570> right<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.920> got

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130
