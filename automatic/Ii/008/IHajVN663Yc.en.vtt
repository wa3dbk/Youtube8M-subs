potato and then using a knife you want

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
potato and then using a knife you want
to<00:01:11.580> cut<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> ends<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.659> nice<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
flat so it's easy to spiralize then

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.070 
flat so it's easy to spiralize then
you're<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> attach<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
potato noodles and then you treat them
just<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.630> regular<00:01:40.020> pasta<00:01:40.229> boil

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
just like you would regular pasta boil

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.770 
just like you would regular pasta boil
them<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> couple<00:01:41.759> minutes<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.600> soften

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
them for a couple minutes just to soften

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
them for a couple minutes just to soften
them<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.920> added<00:01:44.130> prosciutto

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
them up and then I added prosciutto

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.380 
them up and then I added prosciutto
creamy<00:01:45.299> goat<00:01:45.540> cheese<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.170> basil<00:01:46.909> mmm<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.180> good

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
creamy goat cheese and basil mmm so good

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
creamy goat cheese and basil mmm so good
so<00:01:48.840> boodles<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.439> essentially<00:01:49.979> julienned

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
so boodles are essentially julienned

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
so boodles are essentially julienned
noodles<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> while<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.899> always<00:01:52.200> sharpen

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
noodles and while you can always sharpen

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.170

there are two other things that can make
your<00:01:55.950> work<00:01:56.100> faster<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> julienne

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
your work faster one is a julienne

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
your work faster one is a julienne
peeler<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.740> run<00:01:59.009> around<00:01:59.250> ten<00:01:59.430> dollars<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
peeler these run around ten dollars and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
peeler these run around ten dollars and
they<00:02:00.450> help<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:00.990> spaghetti<00:02:01.439> style
