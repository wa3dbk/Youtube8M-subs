00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
better as he matures that that can be

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.190 
better as he matures that that can be
learned<00:03:16.430> but<00:03:16.940> right<00:03:17.150> now<00:03:17.330> at<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.720> moment<00:03:17.780> he

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
learned but right now at this moment he

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.080
