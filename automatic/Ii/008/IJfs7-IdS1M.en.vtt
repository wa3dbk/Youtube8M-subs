00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.690
 new counting focused on a franchise 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.400
 very successful within the genre rpg me

 I mean the elder scrolls series 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.130
 or not 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.130
 i 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.000
 nobody can deny the resounding success that 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.010
 has achieved this series for some 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.990
 years growing base grows 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.550
 fanatics and it is not for less if you 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.320
 are followers of the series of this video 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.170
 they will love it and if they are beginners 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.780
 also in these next two videos 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.850
 9 will share actual data while 1 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.500
 it will be false so turn on your detector 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.540
 of lies so that they discover the data 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.830
 that is outside the real framework of the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.830
 games let's start 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.950
 english 312 mst 312 scandinavian fantasy 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.570
 world is the name of the official subject 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.550
 that is taught at the University of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.650
 texas in this class the students 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.810
 they left behind the long readings and 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.850
 thousands of books to play skyrim and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.229
 complete missions within the game 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.150
 according to the teacher who teaches the class 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.380
 this dynamic helps players to 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 understand the importance of 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.130
 mythology within literature and so 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.430
 follow the course of the stories 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.430
 current 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.679
 in 2011 Betesda the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.630
 game developers gave to 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.549
 know an important dynamic for 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.350
 integrate more people into the saga all the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.960

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.280
 November 2011 and they will call it back 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.860

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.689

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.329

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.280

 betesda received all the games 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.450
 Free the vice of this child started still 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.450
 earlier than ours 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.750
 at some point in the development of skyrim 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.760
 dt was received an offer to create a 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.920
 game based on a book by George Rr 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.840
 martin according to the first version the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.430
 study rejected the offer to begin 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.620
 to develop a new world and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.920
 totally original a great lesson not 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920
 believe 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.620
 is to fall into account with a repertoire of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.780
 quite amazing dubbing actors 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.520
 and full of talent for example 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.010
 Jim Cummings who worked on tapes 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.959
 as aladino and dragon age also counts 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.239
 with the participation of charles martinet 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.700
 known for giving life to Mario Luigi 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.010
 wario and don king kong finally the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.050
 actor known as russel presented his 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.180

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.180

 will remember who their companions 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.950
 will return to their original position if they are 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.139
 ignored for a certain period of time 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.939
 however if they ignore the time 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.650
 necessary they will leave them aside and 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.510
 they will begin to explore the world on their own 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.470
 alone they expected they are also 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.750
