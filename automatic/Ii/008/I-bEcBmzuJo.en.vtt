00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.390
 when it's time to go gary 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.450
 Go on like gary scary ghost hour 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.220
 the playstation 3 with beyond tools that 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.310
 maybe last really big title 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.780
 for the ca and contours get the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.520
 also it is one of the major 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.020
 be and what we have just seen 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.970
 probably thought so now eight 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.120
 was definitely your own friend but 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.370
 that was not one of those here so 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.170
 it has awakened but it was the monster 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.149
 and of which later still a theme 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.640
 a little more so we are our more horror 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.920
 as you might think and could 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.420
 Green would always be typical 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.329
 everyday situations mixed or go 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.820
 over in really dramatic scenes so 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.260
 not here next to battle and that's yes 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.680
 somehow different and notice that too 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.910
 children and that is constantly mistreated 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.219
 it really sounds like that 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.500
 cruel but there is a hers 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.750
 Invisible friend and I know that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.530
 of course , but of course, too 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.289
 not the fine kind 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.990
 that's true you have several now 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.490
 hours already played and you can 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 I'm sure that's all 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.340
 was triggered automatically was 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.380
 this ghost plays or if you are there 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.670
 You can decide for yourself because you like that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.470
 outside one engages thus in the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.729
 In most cases you can do it yourself 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.140
 Decide at the beginning if one to 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.200
 it is then demonstrated 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.000
 automatically presented and then there is 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.709
 stop scene at the beginning where you have such a tip 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.780
 get or where you own 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.520
 speaks and you realize he should me 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.899
 but perhaps switch to a one 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.130
 may reasonably fall in most of it 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.009
 really take care of yourself and of course 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.630
 decide for yourself what to do with 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.910
 own and here are now on 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.330
 a party mode is now a teenager 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.429
 an unsure teenager and she leaves 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.099
 the types are not so ran and how stop 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.009
 so teenagers are defending themselves then 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.789
 very nice in a very nasty way 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.789
 but I will 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.409
 make some media I know it 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.409
 but different for the parties earlier 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 it is that they want to here that the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.510
 her special skills will show her off 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.640
 but that does not want and that's why 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.959
 here you can almost say 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.959
 tortured at least already times 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.019
 We have already seen but we see now 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 See more in the video later 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.410
 actually not at all with heavy rain too 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 always do it when you have one 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.430
 controls what, of course, even genre 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.680
 Overall, a special feature is that 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.489
 You often have each line in such a thing 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.470
 can change 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.900
 and here is the decision I go 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.250
 Just go away or more like decide 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.069
 is, of course, has for 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.140
 your laugh and now you can just one 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.019
 control yourself here and you can see 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.209
 always objects are always marked 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.030
 which you can control yourself or just 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.859
 with the energy pulse yes throw away 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.870
 can and you can call him right 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.359
 crawls worry it's really like that 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.560
 poltergeist yes yes and that is really 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.570
 a special feature you actually 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.859
 still experienced in very few games 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.530
 So there you have to say there I was 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.910
 really surprised how much new gameplay 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.170
 really in there and raises 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.090
 really off halloween 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.850
 funnily, there was a game cube 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.100
 ego shooter that was called ghost wdr 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.209
 because he had the ability also there 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.280
 you could also in such objects 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.530
 hatch and then for example one 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.690
 overturn the coffee pot then watchman 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.100
 to scare us game was unfortunately very 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.100
 moderately the idea was already good at that time 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.170
 pay attention to the dramatic music of 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.689
 hans room and now it gets it right 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.120
 happy we are complex in a laboratory 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:55.180
 and what should I say there was one 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.829
 open portal and come through 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.530
 now just these monsters so to speak 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.200
 the evil brothers of their own 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.780
 they want to be here now in ours 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.500
 You have to step in the world and as a jockey you have to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.519
 now close this portal again and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.870
 At the same time, one constantly becomes one of these 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.239
 monsters hatched by 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.760
 Attacked and tried as well 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.199
 to protect those 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.459
 game over situations then at such 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.109
 So if we do not for example 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.759
 really forget or is it always 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.800
 Continue only in a different way than 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.020
 there is if it somehow verkackt 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.150
 then there are passages in the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.349
 steer another direction and through 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.449
 which somehow you can save yourself 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.669
 So until the game over is already on 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.380
 gone but I have to say a total 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.030
 that me the story is very fast 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.860
 has made you curious and that 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.750
 Joe who is constantly being attacked for what 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.000
 they can not grow anything 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.070
 invariably to her heart so she 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.110
 certainly not a game for everyone 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.919
 but it has such a fascinating 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.919
 uniqueness
