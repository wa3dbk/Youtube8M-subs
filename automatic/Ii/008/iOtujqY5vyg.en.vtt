right there mag sealed basically guy has
been<00:00:38.850> using<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.210> oil<00:00:39.420> created<00:00:39.750> by<00:00:39.840> NASA<00:00:40.110> that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
been using an oil created by NASA that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
been using an oil created by NASA that
responds<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> magnet<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> when<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
responds to a magnet and when in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
responds to a magnet and when in
response<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> magnetic<00:00:43.530> forms<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.280> can

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
response to the magnetic forms you can

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610 
response to the magnetic forms you can
form<00:00:44.579> shapes<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.379> case

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
form shapes out of it so in this case

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
form shapes out of it so in this case
you're<00:00:46.829> using<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> keep<00:00:47.579> water<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you're using it to keep water out so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
you're using it to keep water out so
it's<00:00:48.360> forming<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> shape<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.960> forms<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> seal

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it's forming the shape that forms a seal

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
it's forming the shape that forms a seal
so<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> worry<00:00:51.030> about<00:00:51.120> water
