00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.510
 if there are means Tteyuu shines in Italian called lucido 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.980
 Apa shop that shines after all 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.980
 I named it lucido 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.970
 I am enjoying you have it in the mirror's incognito become naturally large looks also quite famous person 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 I will 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.950
 Italian 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:38.620
 I think it's also a casual feeling that doesn't stick to the form 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 It's cheap and the amount is over and it's easy to say it's an Italian like you're doing phone 7 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.950
 is not it 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 Rub the reservation because it is only to make cooking for its customers that fried on the day of I mean 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.290
 Only for customers who have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.290
 I keep in mind to listen to likes and dislikes and prepare something good . 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.659
 We use vegetables without pesticides 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.659
 I think that you are using vegetables that have a solid taste 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:23.480
 In the pasta era, the Lord does not have to do anything in an appearance to make her listen 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.740
 So if the taste gets dulled, I will add some boiled juice 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.740
 That's basic 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.370
 Fish is the best thing to say that day 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.870
 And I also purposely do what you can eat with sashimi 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.550
 I'll through the fire 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.550
 I want to have a feeling of luxury 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 The wind form Tteyuu here because I eat those delicious and want to eat after all delicious things 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.880
 I want you to come
