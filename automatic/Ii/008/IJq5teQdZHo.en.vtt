 Hi, I'm Manuel Becerra and this is water 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.089
 tv today we are going to talk about 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.189
 of snails that are not good at 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.900
 a marine fishbowl before anything else 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.820
 thank you all for all 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.349
 he likes all his comments that I 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 they have left on my channel the truth 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.190
 they help a lot to keep bringing them 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.840
 this kind of videos and I wanted 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.520
 thank you in a little way 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.750
 more tangible for you then I 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.080
 I contacted the company 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.090
 audible.com and they are offering them 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.699
 now 30 days free of your service and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.009
 an audiobook which the truth is very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 very good since right now for example I 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.670
 I'm using it to read the book of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.469
 labyrinth runner while I go to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
 I work then in that time that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.160
 I usually did not have this is the point 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.410
 lost and right now I'm taking advantage 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 to be able to listen to that book then 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.570
 I have done something very very father feel 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.120
 that my time is much better and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.699
 to access this promotion 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.100
 they just have to go audible 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.019
 working.com diagonal water tv 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.800
 now continuing month and in the subject 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.570
 main of this video is about the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.190
 snails bad us first that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.509
 nothing for what snails do not 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.630
 the snails serve three things 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.310
 to eat the seaweed to keep the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.710
 sand to a certain extent a little bit 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.780
 clean and for 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.490
 and eliminate the additional nutrients from 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.140
 the fish tank that is the food that can be 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.000
 get out there a little extra 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.730
 the droppings or things that are generated 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.190
 of the fish now 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.600
 if snails are used for this 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.680
 true that of bad snails because the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.090
 truth is that yes because not all of us 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.070
 they will help to get to meet 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.680
 exactly those three things not now 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.180
 let's start talking about this 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.160
 first type of snail the snail of 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.740
 Babylonia although this snail 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.830
 you see very very nice there are times that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.480
 they sell like the nazario is elegant and the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.250
 truth this snail the only thing that is going to 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.680
 to do is eat other snails 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.030
 does not lower them, they will not help anything 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.800
 we do have this character together 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.710
 with another type of snails, so if 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.850
 will become the malice of trades 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.410
 the snails that are helping them 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.720
 to control for example the algae not 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.540
 another type of snails the snail of the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.880
 olive 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.250
 it's also an opportunistic snail and it 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.170
 eat the microfauna then it is not 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.640
 recommended either and there are also times 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.860
 that you get to eat other snails 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.170
 then also this type of snail does not 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.570
 I recommend them the following type of 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.100
 snail is the clean guy there are some 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.410
 that are safe, they only have to 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.700
 Check that they are herbivores since the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.740
 that are not the living eat the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 corals then it's not good that they have 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.130
 this type of snail in case it is that 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.560
 they have coral not only that also at 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 be meat can reach the trade to 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.760
 other snails now the next guy 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.920
 of snail is the queen snail that the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.830
 really nice so called 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.480
 so and the bad thing about this snail is that 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.370
 it grows a lot then unless 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.410
 have a very big fish tank with the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.530
 enough space to have it if 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.510
 they will be able to maintain their fish tank but if 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.690
 they do not have it then we 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.190
 I recommend because the snail does not 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.470
 that is going to be very big is like this 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.120
 size with my hand will be pulling 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.650
 the rocks and is that they are not well stuck 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.239
 the oscar the corals will be 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.610
 pulling and nothing else're doing them is 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.440
 run which I do not recommend another 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.600
 type of snail that is also very 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.100
 nice is this snail of cargol 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.250
 flamingo 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.590
 that although it looks nice with the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.240
 most beautiful month you can not have it in a 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.860
 reef fish tank because because this 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.840
 snail is going to eat the politicians of 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.970
 all the corals in this position with 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 aspirins then you can not have if 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.900
 they have one presents only fish 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.390
 go ahead if you can have it now this 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.070
 type of snail snail to horror 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.870
 in some of my other videos I showed them 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.910
 I bought it and I was excited if 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.300
 this one also helps to clean everything 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.390
 because then if it's all but if you try 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.220
 to eat everything from the sand then to 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.110
 eat the microfauna then it's not good 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.330
 have that kind of snail from the guides 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.920
 22 23 12 I died one out there still 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.830
 I have not found it, I will not be able to 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.990
 get it out but these snails and they have 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.520
 a deep bed of sand, nothing else 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.170
 they will be spoiled and they will have 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.300
 problems because they are going to be 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.970
 eating all the microfauna not another type 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.320
 of snails of the murex snail that 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.150
 I do not recommend it either. 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.180
 identify because you have these reasons 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.810
 there are gone because this snail the only thing 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.269
 what they do is snails 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.290
 Nor will it help them then and 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.590
 they had their snails there they want us 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.389
 buy this 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.130
 will not serve you will not eat 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.470
 everyone else this other kind of 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.449
 snail snail and neither nasa 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.030
 I recommend them because you eat other 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.590
 snails and apart there are times that bring 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.910
 a parasite that can infect the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.210
 fish and can also infect the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.030
 humans then usually at least 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.630
 in states in the USA is a little bit more 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.680
 controlled its sale but in other countries 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.780
 It may be that I'm not in Mexico 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.210
 very sure that you can get nothing 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.710
 more be careful not to buy it 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.560
 then they do not know how to identify the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.419
 snail do not even buy it now 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.470
 this other type of snail and snail 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.710
 Daisy has been very popular 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.600
 recently because they sell it as if 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.540
 ate the seaweed I never know how 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.490
 Mexican turbo but the difference is that 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.080
 this snail is of low temperatures 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.240
 then this cardboard is not going to be 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.789
 nothing bad to your fish tank unlike 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.620
 the others that I mentioned but this 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.690
 snail to realize that the only thing 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.490
 they are doing is to make him suffer if 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.950
 You put it in a fish tank and you get it 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.530
 that usually heras 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.500
 tempered the only things that will be 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.090
 doing is to be going to the snail by 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.950
 a bad time because the temperature of 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.600
 ours that they are used to 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.700
 although if you can live to live 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.320
 several months in a reef tank 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.030
 we recommend as you the 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.000
 they sent to the desert 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.530
 nothing else eating an equal thing and they go 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.300
 to live several months but after a 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.530
 long enough to say he hears like it's not 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.110
 my environment not then do not get them 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.100
 They want to migrate the Mexican turbo 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.280
 much better option 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.200
 finally the snail crown or snail 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.150
 for sometimes they do not sell well 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.390
 I do not recommend them either because this 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.280
 snail what other corals eat too 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.440
 the seen that they sell it as the 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.790
 snail fighter that are not like the 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.100
 snails fighters that I have that 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.410
 there are already profits coming from 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.000
 night if they want to see detail in one 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.310
 videos of my cleaning equipment 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.760
 a marine person and you can see that 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.680
 type of snail the real fighter 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.420
 like the one I have if it's good this 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.970
 snail and snail crown is not 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.979
 so I do not recommend them for a 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.509
 third 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.099
 very well then this would be all for the 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.779
 moment if you like my videos the 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:42.819
 I invite you to subscribe to my channel and 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.819
 all your thumbs up thank you very much
