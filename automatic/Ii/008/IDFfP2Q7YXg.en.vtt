00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.960 
it's very similar to a blackberry if
you've<00:01:03.800> ever<00:01:03.950> been<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.159> blackberry<00:01:04.610> user<00:01:04.790> it

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
actually load up to the screen so we're

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.349

this unlock code that we use in this

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.080 
this unlock code that we use in this
video<00:02:47.319> won't<00:02:47.800> work<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.190> your<00:02:48.310> phone<00:02:48.519> now<00:02:49.030> the

reason why is because each unlock code

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.670 
reason why is because each unlock code
is<00:02:51.489> unique<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.209> IMEI<00:02:52.660> or<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.410> serial
