hey<00:00:03.570> guys<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.170> third<00:00:04.529> week<00:00:04.740> has<00:00:04.980> been<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
hey guys so third week has been a

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.690 
hey guys so third week has been a
complete<00:00:06.569> blur<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.259> be<00:00:07.350> honest<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.980> think<00:00:08.550> if

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
complete blur to be honest I think if

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.950 
complete blur to be honest I think if
you<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:08.910> tell<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.240> very<00:00:09.420> tired<00:00:09.690> at<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
you can tell it I'm very tired at the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.810 
you can tell it I'm very tired at the
moment<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.620> reason<00:00:10.769> for<00:00:10.980> being<00:00:11.160> tired<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
moment the reason for being tired is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.970 
moment the reason for being tired is
that<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.570> week<00:00:12.750> has<00:00:12.870> been<00:00:12.929> very<00:00:13.530> busy<00:00:13.799> but

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
that this week has been very busy but

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.709 
that this week has been very busy but
whilst<00:00:14.250> last<00:00:14.490> week<00:00:14.670> was<00:00:14.790> busy<00:00:15.089> because<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.509> did

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
whilst last week was busy because I did

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.170 
whilst last week was busy because I did
lots<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.080> different<00:00:16.139> things<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:17.460> week<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.880> did

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
lots of different things this week I did

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.700 
lots of different things this week I did
pretty<00:00:18.359> much<00:00:18.449> one<00:00:18.690> thing<00:00:18.840> exclusively<00:00:19.320> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
pretty much one thing exclusively and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099 
pretty much one thing exclusively and
that<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.070> work<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.570> week<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.930> had<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that was work so this week I had a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.330 
that was work so this week I had a
problem<00:00:22.350> she<00:00:22.470> tuned<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.949> atmospheric

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
problem she tuned for atmospheric

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179 
problem she tuned for atmospheric
physics<00:00:23.490> which<00:00:24.180> was<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.660> last<00:00:24.869> set<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.260> new

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
physics which was the last set of new

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.500 
physics which was the last set of new
material<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> had<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> learn<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.420> my

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
material that I had to learn for my

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.709 
material that I had to learn for my
exams<00:00:28.130> which<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.660> four<00:00:30.660> weeks<00:00:30.869> away<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:32.719> in

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
exams which are four weeks away and in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.220 
exams which are four weeks away and in
this<00:00:33.780> particular<00:00:33.930> case<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:35.390> about<00:00:36.390> where

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this particular case it was about where

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.720 
this particular case it was about where
it<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> advanced<00:00:38.010> geophysical<00:00:38.670> fluid

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
it was the advanced geophysical fluid

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.910 
it was the advanced geophysical fluid
dynamics<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> mix<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.410> largely

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
dynamics so it was a mix of largely

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.180 
dynamics so it was a mix of largely
quasi<00:00:41.280> geostrophic<00:00:41.790> flow<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.190> oceans

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.240 
have a high pressure so for example
south<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.090> Spain<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.949> an<00:01:05.010> area

horizontal<00:01:53.759> scale<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> phenomenon<00:01:54.600> as

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
horizontal scale for the phenomenon as

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.149 
horizontal scale for the phenomenon as
well<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.530> there's<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> couple<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
well you know there's a couple of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770 
well you know there's a couple of
thousand<00:01:56.490> kilometers<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> vertical

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
thousand kilometers but the vertical

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.069 
thousand kilometers but the vertical
scale<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.170> say<00:01:59.299> hundred<00:02:00.299> meters<00:02:00.600> maybe<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
scale is say hundred meters maybe and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.100 
scale is say hundred meters maybe and
based<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.009> proclamations<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.630> length

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
based on proclamations of the length

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
based on proclamations of the length
scales<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.770> velocity<00:02:05.369> scales<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> time

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
scales the velocity scales and time

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
scales the velocity scales and time
scales<00:02:06.090> impulsive<00:02:06.960> games<00:02:07.290> where<00:02:07.649> there<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.799> a

in<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.910> big<00:02:12.240> full<00:02:12.600> equation<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.410> sort<00:02:13.620> of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
in the big full equation you can sort of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.470 
in the big full equation you can sort of
chop<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.010> down<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:14.910> more<00:02:15.120> manageable

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
chop it down so much more manageable

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
chop it down so much more manageable
with<00:02:15.960> version<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.500> when<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.790> that's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
with version and when you do that that's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.250 
with version and when you do that that's
making<00:02:18.300> an<00:02:18.540> approximation<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.170> the

making an approximation and the
geostrophic<00:02:19.560> approximation<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.490> one<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
geostrophic approximation is just one of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
geostrophic approximation is just one of
them<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.300> was<00:02:21.390> fine<00:02:21.540> for<00:02:21.660> thousand

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
them and that was fine for thousand

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.880 
them and that was fine for thousand
atmospheric<00:02:22.320> work<00:02:22.410> which<00:02:22.530> was<00:02:22.620> meant<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> be

of had to go know so this week has been
completely<00:02:46.680> shocked<00:02:46.950> evoke<00:02:47.190> I've<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.490> been

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
completely shocked evoke I've just been

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.860 
completely shocked evoke I've just been
in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> library<00:02:48.000> pretty<00:02:48.390> much<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> entire

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
in the library pretty much the entire

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.720 
in the library pretty much the entire
time<00:02:48.900> when<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> did<00:02:49.890> venture<00:02:50.100> out<00:02:50.400> into<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
time when I did venture out into the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790 
time when I did venture out into the
real<00:02:50.880> world<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.480> managed<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> do<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> couple<00:02:52.740> of

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
real world I managed to do a couple of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.380 
real world I managed to do a couple of
things<00:02:52.950> though<00:02:53.100> notably<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.880> Wednesday<00:02:54.270> we

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
things though notably on Wednesday we

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.720 
things though notably on Wednesday we
had<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> finalists<00:02:55.290> meal<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.610> is

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
had a finalists meal so this is

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.680 
had a finalists meal so this is
something<00:02:56.850> call<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.120> Edgar<00:02:57.240> Jones<00:02:57.570> Memorial

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
something call that Edgar Jones Memorial

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.020 
something call that Edgar Jones Memorial
dinner<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.410> echo<00:02:58.560> James<00:02:58.830> was<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.340> guy<00:02:59.760> who<00:02:59.820> came

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
dinner and echo James was a guy who came

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.590 
dinner and echo James was a guy who came
to<00:03:00.180> st.<00:03:00.330> Peters<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> think<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.530> 30s<00:03:02.100> and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
to st. Peters and I think for 30s and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
to st. Peters and I think for 30s and
basically<00:03:03.600> gave<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.140> college<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> large

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
basically gave the college a large

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.490 
basically gave the college a large
amount<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.860> money<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.310> said<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.840> last<00:03:07.080> term

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
amount of money and said the last term

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.590 
amount of money and said the last term
when<00:03:08.070> you're<00:03:08.220> an<00:03:08.430> undergraduate<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.240> Oxford

when you're an undergraduate at Oxford

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.870 
when you're an undergraduate at Oxford
is<00:03:09.780> special<00:03:10.560> because<00:03:11.310> not<00:03:11.340> only<00:03:11.520> do<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.820> have
