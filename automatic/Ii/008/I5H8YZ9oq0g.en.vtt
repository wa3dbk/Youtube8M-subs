00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.140 
can use it to and it works just as good
for<00:04:51.050> men<00:04:51.199> it's<00:04:51.470> not<00:04:51.650> specifically<00:04:52.280> for<00:04:52.820> women

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
for men it's not specifically for women

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.260

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
even though artistry target to him

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.020 
even though artistry target to him
because<00:04:56.539> women<00:04:56.960> tend<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.320> use<00:04:57.560> more<00:04:58.030> products

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
because women tend to use more products

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.740

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.140 
than men as far as skincare and makeup
etc<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.680> good<00:05:03.800> for<00:05:03.949> men<00:05:04.070> too<00:05:04.340> it's
