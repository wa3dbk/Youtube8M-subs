00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
ammo and you can just get as much as you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.170 
ammo and you can just get as much as you
want<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:38.100> tech<00:01:38.340> land<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
want and in tech land that's not the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
want and in tech land that's not the
idea<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.350> pretty<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
idea of this it's pretty much like the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
idea of this it's pretty much like the
idea<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> dead<00:01:42.090> rising<00:01:42.299> where<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.899> pick

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
idea of dead rising where you just pick

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480 
idea of dead rising where you just pick
up<00:01:43.140> anything<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.070> hands<00:01:44.280> on

up anything you can get your hands on

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
up anything you can get your hands on
and<00:01:44.759> beat<00:01:45.600> yours<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.930> beat<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> zombies<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and beat yours on beat the zombies to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.730 
and beat yours on beat the zombies to
death<00:01:46.970> which<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.960> some<00:01:49.649> of

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
death which is I like that and some of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.510 
death which is I like that and some of
you<00:01:49.829> may<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.399> keep<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> mind<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you may not so keep that in mind now the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
you may not so keep that in mind now the
publisher<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.360> actually<00:01:54.630> describes<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
publisher of this actually describes it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
publisher of this actually describes it
as<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> dark<00:01:55.740> twisted<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.460> gritty<00:01:56.729> type<00:01:57.000> game

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
as a dark twisted and gritty type game

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.600 
as a dark twisted and gritty type game
and<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> first<00:01:58.619> person<00:01:59.070> shooter<00:01:59.460> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and it's in the first person shooter so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.980 
and it's in the first person shooter so
it's<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.880> left<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.329> dead<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> dead<00:02:00.960> rising

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's like left for dead and dead rising

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's like left for dead and dead rising
combined<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:01.860> which<00:02:02.790> sounds<00:02:03.060> pretty<00:02:03.270> cool

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
combined in one which sounds pretty cool

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
combined in one which sounds pretty cool
if<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.320> play<00:02:04.649> left<00:02:04.920> 4<00:02:05.040> dead<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
if you actually play left 4 dead to the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
if you actually play left 4 dead to the
right<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.060> use<00:02:06.860> weapons

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
right you can actually use weapons

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.949 
right you can actually use weapons
instead<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.789> using<00:02:08.910> guns<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.780> probably

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
instead of using guns and it's probably

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.960 
instead of using guns and it's probably
going<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.760> maybe

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to be just like that but maybe

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.510 
going to be just like that but maybe
have<00:02:12.209> better<00:02:12.420> graphics<00:02:12.870> or<00:02:12.989> something<00:02:13.230> like

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
have better graphics or something like

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.880 
have better graphics or something like
it's<00:02:14.210> going<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> 4-player<00:02:15.050> co-op<00:02:15.260> sand<00:02:15.830> you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
it's going to 4-player co-op sand you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.080 
it's going to 4-player co-op sand you
can<00:02:16.040> choose<00:02:16.250> from<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.520> set<00:02:16.790> number<00:02:16.820> of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
can choose from a set number of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.330 
can choose from a set number of
characters<00:02:17.630> pretty<00:02:18.170> much<00:02:18.320> just<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.770> left<00:02:19.100> 4

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
characters pretty much just like left 4

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.160 
characters pretty much just like left 4
dead<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.300> going<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.450> be<00:02:20.540> for<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.780> xbox

this<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.780> could<00:03:08.960> go<00:03:09.080> either<00:03:09.110> way<00:03:09.440> it's

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
this is it could go either way it's

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.560 
this is it could go either way it's
either<00:03:10.490> going<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.730> really<00:03:11.060> good<00:03:11.090> or<00:03:11.330> really

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
either going to be really good or really

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.800 
either going to be really good or really
bad<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.190> TV<00:03:13.400> series<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:14.210> pretty<00:03:14.720> much

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
bad and the TV series was pretty much

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.870 
bad and the TV series was pretty much
just<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.350> comic<00:03:15.710> book<00:03:15.860> series<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.730> was

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
just like the comic book series it was

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.810 
just like the comic book series it was
very<00:03:16.970> well<00:03:17.300> done<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.900> I'm<00:03:18.890> not<00:03:19.100> entirely<00:03:19.610> sure

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
very well done and I'm not entirely sure

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.790 
very well done and I'm not entirely sure
how<00:03:20.390> they're<00:03:20.600> going<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.750> turn<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.200> TV<00:03:21.560> series

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
how they're going to turn the TV series

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.100 
how they're going to turn the TV series
from<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.160> comic<00:03:22.490> book<00:03:22.640> series<00:03:22.850> into<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> video

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
from the comic book series into a video

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.160 
from the comic book series into a video
game<00:03:24.760> taking<00:03:25.760> into<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> TV<00:03:26.330> series<00:03:26.480> was<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.959> good

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
game taking into a TV series was a good

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.170 
game taking into a TV series was a good
idea<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:27.530> i'm<00:03:27.920> not<00:03:28.040> sure<00:03:28.280> if<00:03:28.400> taking<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:28.850> into

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
idea but i'm not sure if taking it into

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.660 
idea but i'm not sure if taking it into
a<00:03:29.209> video<00:03:29.840> game<00:03:30.080> series<00:03:30.350> would<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.520> good

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
a video game series would be that good

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.300 
a video game series would be that good
of<00:03:31.730> an<00:03:31.880> idea<00:03:32.290> don't<00:03:33.290> get<00:03:33.470> me<00:03:33.590> wrong<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:33.800> TV
