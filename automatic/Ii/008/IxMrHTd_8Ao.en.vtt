00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.070
 the prediction is that the recreate is a painting that simulates appearance of painting 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.189

 to make the adventures of such an interesting effect we will need the following 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.999
 material 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.659
