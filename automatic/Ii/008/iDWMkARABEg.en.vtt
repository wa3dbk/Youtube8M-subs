again on this hard drive we'll go ahead

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.390 
again on this hard drive we'll go ahead
and<00:01:25.509> look<00:01:25.659> at<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:26.799> like<00:01:26.950> I've<00:01:27.100> told<00:01:27.280> you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
in our tutorials organization is

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.859 
in our tutorials organization is
critical<00:01:29.770> so<00:01:30.430> create<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:30.880> new<00:01:31.030> folder<00:01:31.450> per

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
critical so create a new folder per

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.170 
critical so create a new folder per
project<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.740> Daisy<00:01:32.950> disk<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.460> now<00:01:33.610> telling<00:01:34.030> me

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
project so Daisy disk is now telling me

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.499 
project so Daisy disk is now telling me
how<00:01:34.630> large<00:01:35.079> every<00:01:35.619> project<00:01:35.829> is<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.060> if<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.299> need

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
how large every project is so if I need

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.780 
how large every project is so if I need
to<00:01:37.750> move<00:01:38.290> some<00:01:38.350> projects<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.100> can<00:01:39.250> do<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.579> or

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
to move some projects I can do that or

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.490 
to move some projects I can do that or
if<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.060> need<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.299> delete<00:01:40.630> them<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.170> do<00:01:41.290> that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
if I need to delete them I can do that

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.399 
if I need to delete them I can do that
so<00:01:42.040> this<00:01:42.610> ties<00:01:42.909> in<00:01:43.180> really<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.810> well<00:01:43.960> and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
so this ties in really really well and

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.100 
so this ties in really really well and
you<00:01:44.890> can<00:01:45.070> see<00:01:45.100> how<00:01:45.790> important<00:01:46.719> this<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:47.079> to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
you can see how important this is to

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.139 
you can see how important this is to
take<00:01:47.979> care<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.280> your<00:01:48.490> hard<00:01:48.700> drives<00:01:48.939> and

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
take care of your hard drives and

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
things you don't need anymore so let's

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.149 
things you don't need anymore so let's
just<00:01:53.049> take<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.200> look<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.590> little<00:01:53.799> bit<00:01:53.890> deeper

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
just take a look a little bit deeper

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
just take a look a little bit deeper
here
