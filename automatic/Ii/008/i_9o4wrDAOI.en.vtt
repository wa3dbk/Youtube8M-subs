kind of blind so from what I looked up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240 
kind of blind so from what I looked up
about<00:01:48.119> them<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.810> about<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.530> girl<00:01:49.890> and

about them it's about this girl and
she's<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.030> some<00:01:51.270> freak<00:01:51.600> accident<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:52.380> killed

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.890 
names I think that authors should just
start<00:03:12.190> phonetically<00:03:12.970> putting<00:03:13.510> their<00:03:13.690> names
