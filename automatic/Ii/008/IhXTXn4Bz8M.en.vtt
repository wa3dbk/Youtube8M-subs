 but 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.000
 and so we play twice the open sixth 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.640

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.640

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.549
 play one more time 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.500
 further once again we play it but already in pause 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:24.280

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:34.690

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:36.759

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.250
 four times already without a pause 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.049
 couplet there somewhere court a 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.240
 that is, for major 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.590

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.590
 combat that is possible to carry out 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.810
