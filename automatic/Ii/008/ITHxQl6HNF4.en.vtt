throw<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.400> hear<00:00:14.969> yeah<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> know<00:00:15.719> it's<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
throw it on to hear yeah I know it's a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.990 
throw it on to hear yeah I know it's a
big<00:00:16.500> change<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.539> know<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.199> and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
big change but I know I can do it and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
big change but I know I can do it and
this<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.600> has<00:00:21.840> more<00:00:21.960> meaning<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this one actually has more meaning to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.279 
this one actually has more meaning to
that<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.300> guys<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.810> records

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that because when you guys see records

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
that because when you guys see records
of<00:00:25.470> bad<00:00:25.680> teams<00:00:26.189> you'll<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.789> able<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.480> which

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
of bad teams you'll be able to see which

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.050

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.969 
after the offseason I'm gonna pick the
I'm<00:01:42.659> gonna<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> Cardinals<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.860> I'm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I'm gonna be the Cardinals so I'm

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.760 
I'm gonna be the Cardinals so I'm
sticking<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.280> Greg<00:01:44.520> Schiano<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
sticking with Greg Schiano right now and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
sticking with Greg Schiano right now and
you'll<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.280> resend<00:01:47.670> players<00:01:47.939> how<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you'll see the resend players how it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.440 
you'll see the resend players how it
just<00:01:48.689> fails<00:01:48.990> miserably<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.000> advance<00:01:51.270> into

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
just fails miserably as we advance into

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
just fails miserably as we advance into
the<00:01:51.570> offseason<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.790> I<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:54.329> think<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> single

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the offseason and I don't think a single

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
the offseason and I don't think a single
player<00:01:54.990> re-signed<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> resigned

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
player re-signed out of the resigned

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.340 
player re-signed out of the resigned
players<00:01:57.420> feature<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> think<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.200> all

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
players feature I think they all

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.459 
players feature I think they all
declined<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.299> then<00:02:00.299> I'll<00:02:00.390> sim<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.719> free

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
declined and then I'll sim the free

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.010 
declined and then I'll sim the free
agent<00:02:01.770> offers<00:02:02.009> I'll<00:02:02.189> delegate<00:02:02.610> at<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
agent offers I'll delegate at all as you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.800 
agent offers I'll delegate at all as you
can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.259> rejected<00:02:04.860> rejection<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:08.390> yes<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.660> we

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
can see rejected rejection and yes so we

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
can see rejected rejection and yes so we
do<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.379> go<00:02:10.530> into<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.770> free<00:02:10.920> agency

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
do that then we go into the free agency

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.490 
do that then we go into the free agency
and<00:02:11.640> they'll<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.510> offers

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
and they'll make offers

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.610 
and they'll make offers
we'll<00:02:13.710> go<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:13.980> there<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.500> very

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
we'll go from there so it's very

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.930 
we'll go from there so it's very
interesting<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.250> lot<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.460> players<00:02:17.700> do

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
interesting because a lot of players do

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
interesting because a lot of players do

Fulk<00:02:57.440> Meacham<00:02:58.440> Brown<00:03:00.050> Robertson<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.590> know

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
Fulk Meacham Brown Robertson you know

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.920 
Fulk Meacham Brown Robertson you know
all<00:03:01.890> those<00:03:02.010> guys<00:03:02.280> then<00:03:02.880> then<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.330> simulate<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
all those guys then then I simulate the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140 
all those guys then then I simulate the
draft<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.890> kind<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.220> avoids<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.970> off

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
draft and so it kind of avoids the off

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.880 
draft and so it kind of avoids the off
season<00:03:06.480> episode<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.230> little<00:03:07.739> bit

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
season episode a little bit

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.790 
season episode a little bit
unfortunately<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.410> even<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.560> being

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
unfortunately but even with that being

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.440 
unfortunately but even with that being
said<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.310> very<00:03:11.910> interesting<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.300> then

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
said it is very interesting and then

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.910 
said it is very interesting and then
I'll<00:03:12.540> show<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.870> guys<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.320> full<00:03:13.470> roster<00:03:13.830> of

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
I'll show you guys the full roster of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.470 
I'll show you guys the full roster of
the<00:03:13.950> team<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.130> didn't<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.880> I'll<00:03:15.390> show

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the team I didn't do that here I'll show

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.850 
the team I didn't do that here I'll show
you<00:03:15.660> guys<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> full<00:03:16.080> roster<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> team<00:03:16.739> I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
you guys the full roster of the team I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.250 
you guys the full roster of the team I
take<00:03:17.040> over<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:18.600> starts<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> next

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
take over and that starts the next

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.380 
take over and that starts the next
season<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.160> very<00:03:20.190> smooth<00:03:20.760> transition

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
season so it's a very smooth transition

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.930 
season so it's a very smooth transition
to<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.540> next<00:03:21.690> season<00:03:22.080> as<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> new<00:03:22.410> coach<00:03:22.650> as

to the next season as a new coach as
long<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:23.970> I'll<00:03:24.209> make<00:03:24.360> playoffs<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.049> hopefully

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
long as I'll make playoffs and hopefully

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.759 
long as I'll make playoffs and hopefully
I<00:03:26.070> will<00:03:26.130> that's<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.480> goal<00:03:27.600> but<00:03:27.900> that

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
I will that's kind of the goal but that

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.590
