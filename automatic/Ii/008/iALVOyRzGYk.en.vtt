00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
in 1990 when I was using these weights

in 1990 when I was using these weights
to<00:00:37.410> warm<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:37.950> now<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> mint<00:00:38.489> just

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
to warm up but right now the mint just
exited<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> stage<00:00:39.690> very<00:00:40.559> interesting

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
exited the stage very interesting

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
exited the stage very interesting
prejudging<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> last<00:00:42.180> call<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
prejudging the last call out was to and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.690 
prejudging the last call out was to and
it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.410> pretty<00:00:43.590> predictable<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.460> two

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
it was pretty predictable but those two

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.970 
it was pretty predictable but those two
were<00:00:45.570> probably<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> pre-contest<00:00:46.559> favorites

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

going into the finals me I think Dennis

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.730 
going into the finals me I think Dennis
may<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> slight<00:01:22.020> edge<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.619> still

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
may have a slight edge but it's still

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.289 
may have a slight edge but it's still
apples<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.159> oranges<00:01:23.369> either<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.700> yeah<00:01:24.240> it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
compete more often I'd like to see him

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.560 
compete more often I'd like to see him
out<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.820> circuit<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.180> little<00:02:37.330> bit<00:02:37.420> more

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
out on the circuit a little bit more

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.510 
out on the circuit a little bit more
maybe<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.960> year<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:39.130> that's<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.340> best

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
maybe this year but that's the best

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.220 
maybe this year but that's the best
seven<00:02:39.640> we've<00:02:39.880> seen<00:02:40.090> also<00:02:40.270> came<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.780> big<00:02:40.960> came

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
seven we've seen also came in big came

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.230 
seven we've seen also came in big came
in<00:02:41.350> full<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.100> mix<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.550> very<00:02:42.760> vascular

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
in full and in the mix and very vascular

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.790 
in full and in the mix and very vascular
I<00:02:43.390> might<00:02:43.570> add<00:02:43.690> his<00:02:43.960> legs<00:02:44.230> also<00:02:44.440> were<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> little

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
I might add his legs also were a little

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.470 
I might add his legs also were a little
bit<00:02:44.950> noticeably<00:02:45.430> down<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:46.090> from<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.360> back

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
bit noticeably down but from the back

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
bit noticeably down but from the back
his<00:02:46.900> back<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.350> vice<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.680> was<00:02:47.800> right<00:02:47.950> there

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
his back of a vice that was right there

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.920 
his back of a vice that was right there
with<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.340> best<00:02:48.490> of<00:02:48.610> yeah<00:02:48.760> from<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.480> back<00:02:49.690> he

you<00:02:58.120> know<00:02:58.240> classic<00:02:58.660> lines<00:02:59.310> but<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.850> got<00:03:01.000> to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
you know classic lines but you got to

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.100 
you know classic lines but you got to
give<00:03:01.210> it<00:03:01.270> up<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.390> these<00:03:01.570> guys<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.810> mean<00:03:01.960> you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
give it up for these guys I mean you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.230 
give it up for these guys I mean you
know<00:03:02.170> I'm<00:03:02.260> losing<00:03:02.530> decent<00:03:03.010> condition<00:03:03.430> not<00:03:04.180> a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
know I'm losing decent condition not a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.030 
know I'm losing decent condition not a
big<00:03:04.420> lineup<00:03:04.630> obviously<00:03:05.080> with<00:03:05.200> eleven<00:03:05.560> guys<00:03:05.740> I

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
big lineup obviously with eleven guys I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.230 
big lineup obviously with eleven guys I
think<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.310> biggest<00:03:06.580> surprise<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:06.940> most

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
think the biggest surprise that most

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.330 
think the biggest surprise that most
people<00:03:07.570> thought<00:03:07.720> was<00:03:07.960> branch<00:03:08.200> Warren<00:03:08.470> coming

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
people thought was branch Warren coming

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.770 
people thought was branch Warren coming
out<00:03:09.430> no<00:03:09.550> branch<00:03:09.760> came<00:03:10.030> out<00:03:10.210> and<00:03:10.360> we<00:03:10.510> saw<00:03:10.630> him<00:03:10.720> at

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
out no branch came out and we saw him at

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.630 
out no branch came out and we saw him at
the<00:03:10.870> Olympia<00:03:11.200> not<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.740> his<00:03:11.860> bus<00:03:12.040> city<00:03:12.250> he'd<00:03:12.520> be

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
the Olympia not of his bus city he'd be

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.370 
the Olympia not of his bus city he'd be
the<00:03:12.730> first<00:03:12.760> one<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.090> admit<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:14.140> he<00:03:14.230> came

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
the first one to admit that but he came

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.660 
the first one to admit that but he came
back<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.770> probably<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.100> best<00:03:15.280> branch<00:03:15.490> one

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
back here probably the best branch one

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.070 
back here probably the best branch one
we've<00:03:15.850> seen<00:03:16.030> at<00:03:16.150> least<00:03:16.240> two<00:03:16.510> years

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
we've seen at least two years

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.520 
we've seen at least two years
gnarlie<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.190> shape<00:03:18.640> veiny<00:03:19.200> vascular<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.440> know

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
gnarlie in shape veiny vascular you know

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.110 
gnarlie in shape veiny vascular you know
getting<00:03:20.770> out<00:03:20.830> there<00:03:21.160> didn't<00:03:21.760> get<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.940> top

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
getting out there didn't get the top

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.400 
getting out there didn't get the top
five<00:03:22.360> call<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.870> think<00:03:23.050> that<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.320> you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
five call and I think that just you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.930 
five call and I think that just you
could<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.680> take<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:23.830> pin<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.370> boom<00:03:24.730> I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
could just take a pin and just boom I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.580 
could just take a pin and just boom I
mean<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.330> wind<00:03:25.840> was<00:03:26.020> out<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.350> sails

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
mean just the wind was out of the sails

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.230 
mean just the wind was out of the sails
right<00:03:26.770> there<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.340> don't<00:03:27.730> know<00:03:27.880> where<00:03:28.060> branch

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
right there I don't know where branch

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.940 
right there I don't know where branch
goes<00:03:28.420> from<00:03:28.600> here<00:03:28.720> well<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.140> think<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.590> whole

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
goes from here well I think that whole

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.500 
goes from here well I think that whole
thing<00:03:30.220> was<00:03:30.370> about<00:03:30.520> genetics<00:03:31.060> man<00:03:31.210> at<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.480> end

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
thing was about genetics man at the end

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.910 
thing was about genetics man at the end
of<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.810> day<00:03:31.960> these<00:03:32.170> guys<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.680> top<00:03:32.890> five

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
of the day these guys in that top five

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.040 
of the day these guys in that top five
they<00:03:33.310> all<00:03:33.460> have<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.880> classical<00:03:34.600> genetics

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
they all have very classical genetics

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.500 
they all have very classical genetics
that<00:03:35.170> you're<00:03:35.260> born<00:03:35.770> with<00:03:35.890> god-given<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.000> then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
that you're born with god-given and then

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.550 
that you're born with god-given and then
you<00:03:37.600> see<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.870> guys<00:03:37.990> standing<00:03:38.320> there<00:03:38.380> with

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you see the guys standing there with

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.380 
you see the guys standing there with
less<00:03:38.800> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.730> structural<00:03:40.150> flaws

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
less you can see the structural flaws

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.240 
less you can see the structural flaws
and<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.690> don't<00:03:40.960> think<00:03:41.110> enough<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.620> muscle<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.100> not

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and I don't think enough a muscle is not

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.800 
and I don't think enough a muscle is not
going<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.490> do<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.760> here<00:03:43.060> with<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.570> lineup

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
going to do it here with this lineup

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.870 
going to do it here with this lineup
anyways<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.220> being<00:03:45.400> said<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.760> guys

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
anyways but that being said the guys

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.610 
anyways but that being said the guys
still<00:03:46.120> brought<00:03:46.420> improvements<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.470> each

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
still brought improvements in each

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.800 
still brought improvements in each
contest<00:03:48.070> we<00:03:48.160> try<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> improve<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.240> so<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.690> got

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
contest we try to improve and so you got

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
contest we try to improve and so you got

guess<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.490> 50%<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> score<00:04:07.360> tonight<00:04:07.600> at<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
guess a 50% of the score tonight at the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.890 
guess a 50% of the score tonight at the
confirmation<00:04:08.500> scoring<00:04:09.130> around<00:04:09.750> any<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.780> those

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
confirmation scoring around any of those

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.720 
confirmation scoring around any of those
spots<00:04:11.200> those<00:04:11.350> guys<00:04:11.560> are<00:04:11.710> all<00:04:11.830> close<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.610> tight

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
spots those guys are all close and tight

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.370 
spots those guys are all close and tight
enough<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.240> can<00:04:13.420> flip-flop<00:04:13.750> either<00:04:14.230> way

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
enough that it can flip-flop either way

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.240 
enough that it can flip-flop either way
so<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.530> mean<00:04:14.650> nothing's<00:04:14.920> set<00:04:15.100> in<00:04:15.130> stone

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
so I mean nothing's set in stone

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.440 
so I mean nothing's set in stone
obviously<00:04:15.820> we're<00:04:15.940> given<00:04:16.090> our<00:04:16.210> early
