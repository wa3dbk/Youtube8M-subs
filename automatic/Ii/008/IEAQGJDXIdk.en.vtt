00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
just the seats thing that you could have

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.680

if<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.220> had<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> passenger<00:02:55.609> so<00:02:56.150> look<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.569> bit

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
if you had a passenger so look a bit

if you had a passenger so look a bit
more<00:02:56.780> realistic<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:58.100> sissy<00:02:58.880> bar<00:02:59.090> as<00:02:59.329> it's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
more realistic a sissy bar as it's

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.050 
more realistic a sissy bar as it's
called<00:02:59.630> there<00:02:59.870> because<00:03:00.700> yeah<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.910> can

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
called there because yeah you can

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.699 
called there because yeah you can
probably<00:03:02.209> imagine<00:03:02.329> so<00:03:03.170> I'll<00:03:03.260> stick<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.560> on

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
probably imagine so I'll stick that on

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.220 
probably imagine so I'll stick that on
you've<00:03:04.579> got<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> rear<00:03:05.120> seat<00:03:05.420> customization

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
you've got the rear seat customization

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.900 
you've got the rear seat customization
as<00:03:06.380> well<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.799> can<00:03:06.980> make<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.280> into<00:03:07.459> one<00:03:07.670> big

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
as well you can make it into one big

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.280 
as well you can make it into one big
seat<00:03:08.180> instead<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.660> having<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.959> little<00:03:09.079> one

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
seat instead of just having a little one

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.440 
seat instead of just having a little one
so<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:10.040> think<00:03:10.400> I'll<00:03:10.700> go<00:03:10.819> with<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.120> because<00:03:11.299> it

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
so I think I'll go with that because it

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.879 
so I think I'll go with that because it
gets<00:03:11.569> rid<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.840> some<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.200> barring<00:03:12.680> there

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
gets rid of some of the barring there

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.170 
gets rid of some of the barring there
which<00:03:13.160> I've<00:03:13.310> never<00:03:13.340> really<00:03:13.730> liked<00:03:13.970> on

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
which I've never really liked on

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.379 
which I've never really liked on
motorbikes<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.930> stick<00:03:15.139> down<00:03:16.299> respray<00:03:17.299> i
