let's have a look at how we use these

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.740 
let's have a look at how we use these
shade<00:00:02.399> cards<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:02.909> color<00:00:03.060> wheels<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.449> actual

pages in a journal here's a page I've

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.810 
pages in a journal here's a page I've
completed<00:00:07.080> using<00:00:07.290> all<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.740> these<00:00:08.040> shades<00:00:08.490> as

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820

you can see on here one of the nice
things<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:12.210> doing<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.840> page<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.500> one

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
things about doing the page just in one

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.210 
things about doing the page just in one
shade<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.690> easier<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.379> blend<00:00:16.680> all

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
shade is that it's easier to blend all

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.010 
shade is that it's easier to blend all
of<00:00:17.460> these<00:00:17.580> colors<00:00:17.910> blend<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.359> easily

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
of these colors blend really easily

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.200 
of these colors blend really easily

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
together and you can see I've managed to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.830 
together and you can see I've managed to
get<00:00:21.390> darker<00:00:21.930> areas<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.180> page<00:00:24.420> and

here<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.160> I've<00:00:26.849> also<00:00:27.029> managed<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.510> build<00:00:27.750> up

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
here and I've also managed to build up

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.099 
here and I've also managed to build up
lighter<00:00:28.380> areas<00:00:29.039> using<00:00:29.340> plenty<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.970> light<00:00:30.210> like

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
lighter areas using plenty of light like

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.700 
lighter areas using plenty of light like
this<00:00:32.360> I've<00:00:33.360> also<00:00:33.600> gone<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.200> back<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
this I've also gone in back with the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.819 
this I've also gone in back with the
darker<00:00:35.190> shades<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:37.050> create<00:00:37.260> extra

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
darker shades here to create extra

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
darker shades here to create extra
texture<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.579> by<00:00:39.000> using<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> these

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
texture and by using all of these

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
texture and by using all of these
different<00:00:39.840> shades<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.129> page<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.430> can

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
different shades on one page you can

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.700 
different shades on one page you can
still<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.210> real<00:00:42.390> depth<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.930> texture<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.680> your

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
still get real depth and texture on your

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.060 
still get real depth and texture on your
page<00:00:44.840> we've<00:00:45.840> looked<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> page<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> uses

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
page we've looked at a page that uses

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.819 
page we've looked at a page that uses
just<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.340> color<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.480> color<00:00:48.750> wheel<00:00:48.829> now

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
just one color on the color wheel now

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
just one color on the color wheel now
we're<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> look<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> page<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.360> uses

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
we're going to look at a page that uses

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
we're going to look at a page that uses
two<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.230> three<00:00:52.500> neighboring<00:00:52.980> colors<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
two or three neighboring colors on the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
two or three neighboring colors on the
color<00:00:53.879> wheel<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.110> page<00:00:55.379> I've<00:00:55.649> gone

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
color wheel and in this page I've gone

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.939 
color wheel and in this page I've gone
from<00:00:56.129> hot<00:00:56.910> pinks<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:58.050> round<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
from hot pinks right round to the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 
from hot pinks right round to the
yellows<00:00:59.280> these<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.820> neighboring<00:01:00.270> colors<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
yellows these are neighboring colors the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.479 
yellows these are neighboring colors the
neighboring<00:01:01.500> colors<00:01:01.800> work<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.280> well

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
neighboring colors work really well

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
neighboring colors work really well
together<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.120> also<00:01:03.329> find<00:01:03.989> them<00:01:04.140> really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
together and I also find them really

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.520 
together and I also find them really
easy<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.949> blend<00:01:05.250> together<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> page<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
easy to blend together on the page you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
easy to blend together on the page you
can<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.890> I've<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.280> light<00:01:08.520> areas<00:01:08.970> here

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
can see I've got my light areas here

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.260 
can see I've got my light areas here
plenty<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.200> yellow<00:01:10.760> right<00:01:11.760> through<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> my

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
plenty of yellow right through to my

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.539 
plenty of yellow right through to my
dark<00:01:12.570> areas<00:01:13.140> hot<00:01:13.530> pinks<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.010> oranges<00:01:14.159> here

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
dark areas hot pinks and oranges here

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.960 
dark areas hot pinks and oranges here
and<00:01:15.119> I've<00:01:15.930> used<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> darker<00:01:16.770> colors<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.759> build

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and I've used the darker colors to build

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.800 
and I've used the darker colors to build
up<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.360> depth<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> texture<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.009> page<00:01:20.810> at

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
up some depth and texture to the page at

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.030 
up some depth and texture to the page at
one<00:01:21.840> time<00:01:22.290> red<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.680> pink

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
one time red and pink

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.399 
one time red and pink
we<00:01:23.759> were<00:01:23.909> told<00:01:24.119> never<00:01:24.479> went<00:01:24.869> together<00:01:25.200> don't

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
we were told never went together don't

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.140 
we were told never went together don't
wear<00:01:25.650> red<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> pink<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.340> actually<00:01:26.850> red<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.969 
pink
worked<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.049> well<00:01:28.200> together<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.860> all

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
worked really well together it's all

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.530 
worked really well together it's all
about<00:01:29.220> knowing<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> rules<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.090> color<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
about knowing the rules of color and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.350 
about knowing the rules of color and
then<00:01:30.869> being<00:01:31.049> brave<00:01:31.320> enough<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.710> break<00:01:31.920> them

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
then being brave enough to break them

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
then being brave enough to break them
we've<00:01:33.360> looked<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> page<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> uses<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
we've looked at a page that uses one

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.980 
we've looked at a page that uses one
color<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.430> color<00:01:35.640> wheel<00:01:35.729> we've<00:01:36.659> looked<00:01:36.869> at

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
color on the color wheel we've looked at

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.990 
color on the color wheel we've looked at
a<00:01:37.049> page<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.500> uses<00:01:37.650> neighboring<00:01:38.369> colors<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a page that uses neighboring colors and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
a page that uses neighboring colors and
this<00:01:39.630> time<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.100> page

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this time I'm going to look at this page

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910 
this time I'm going to look at this page
here<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.150> page<00:01:42.450> uses<00:01:42.840> opposite<00:01:43.409> colors<00:01:43.740> on

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
here this page uses opposite colors on

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.149 
here this page uses opposite colors on
the<00:01:44.250> color<00:01:44.430> wheel<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.909> pink<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:46.439> green<00:01:46.470> here

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the color wheel so pink to green here
