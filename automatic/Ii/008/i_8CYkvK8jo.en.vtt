00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 in the film 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.169
 for what 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.689
 it is known that the issue of extinction 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.159
 for doing a lot of things 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.159
 the comment we can not address all 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
 the shakhtar we lack resources we lack human resources 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 we are not looking for the most strategic way and address 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.030
 beyond whom 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.910
 no, there is not a concern 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.550
 do not forget 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 as one more displacement 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950
 a presumed maximum 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.990
 eric is one more displacement that needs infrastructures 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 the legal framework 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.410
 I needed the regulation 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.140
 in the protect and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.040
 that he himself 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.200
 manage around all an interaction of these goals that has the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.890
 city 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 and that whatever is common, effective displacements 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.670
 they have simply seen it as 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.640
 in everything and your side your bank account 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.870
 percent 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.310
 that is worked 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 its aspects of road safety 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 if you realize your requests 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 on the road 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.910

 Fabian Bordagaray 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.580
 but 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.550
 in general 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.290
 it hurts us deeply is a cultural change 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.440
 but citizenship 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.890
 very aggressive 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.130
 paez the vehicle once walking 20 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.200
 a third 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
 they already see as normal 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.930
 it's going to be slow 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.240
 it depends on us also night 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.280
 the change are taking place in the world 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.220
 the tea party has been working so hard and cyclists finally the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.460
 proper management 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 the scopes of the mobility society 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.560
 commitment 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.269
 of stage 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.329
 for a city for all 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.529
 the most vulnerable areas 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.629
 included he fits perfectly to work 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.629
 dozens of students of silver lanÃºs 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
 police 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.979
 with nobody 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.549
 I contribute that to illa a 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 people upload their photo 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.029
 however happy and pursue 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.769
 finally allowed 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.989
 it has happened to me 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.989
