chip yet you're gonna need to take this
black<00:01:13.350> part<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.369> slowly<00:01:15.330> move

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
black part right here and slowly move

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.990 
black part right here and slowly move
this<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.920> access<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this up so then you have access to the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
this up so then you have access to the
chip<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> need<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> do

now is you're going to need to flip the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
now is you're going to need to flip the
chip<00:01:21.810> over<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.130> piece<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.640> here

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
chip over and if this piece right here

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.380 
chip over and if this piece right here
is<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:25.340> just<00:01:26.340> connect<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.880> right

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
is off just connect that back right

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.280 
is off just connect that back right
there<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.610> if<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.880> piece<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.630> off<00:01:30.810> just

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
there and if this piece here is off just

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
there and if this piece here is off just
connect<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.860> onto<00:01:32.159> there<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.390> was

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
connect it back onto there and that was

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
connect it back onto there and that was
your<00:01:33.689> problem<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.380> fixed<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
your problem then it's fixed but

your problem then it's fixed but
sometimes<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:36.869> things<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.290> stop<00:01:37.619> working

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
sometimes these things just stop working

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.580 
sometimes these things just stop working
and<00:01:38.340> everything<00:01:39.000> looks<00:01:39.270> fine<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:40.470> you're

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.620 
going to need to do is you're going to
need<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.970> move<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.520> way<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> make

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
need to move this like this way and make

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.649 
need to move this like this way and make
sure<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.500> way<00:01:46.799> alright<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> then

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
sure this is this way alright and then

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.980 
sure this is this way alright and then
if<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> doesn't<00:01:49.979> work<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.840> wiggle<00:01:51.840> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
if that doesn't work just wiggle this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.830 
if that doesn't work just wiggle this
around<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.439> bit<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.119> too<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.509> not

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
around a little bit but not too much not

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.370 
around a little bit but not too much not
not<00:01:55.140> enough<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> break<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:57.200> put<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
not enough to break it and then put this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
not enough to break it and then put this
chip<00:01:58.680> back<00:01:59.070> inside<00:02:00.860> by<00:02:01.860> putting<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> part

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
chip back inside by putting this part

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.050 
chip back inside by putting this part
