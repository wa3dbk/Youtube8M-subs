00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
personal preference against that I use

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
personal preference against that I use
when<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.119> desktop<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.080> use<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.829> logitech

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

mouse and I have my wheel on my logitech

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.490 
mouse and I have my wheel on my logitech
mouse<00:01:31.520> set<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.500> scroll

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
mouse set so that it will scroll

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.289 
mouse set so that it will scroll
smoothly<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.369> prefer<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.119> that's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
smoothly and I prefer that but that's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.600 
smoothly and I prefer that but that's
not<00:01:36.450> really<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.689> negative<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
not really a negative of this is just a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.080 
not really a negative of this is just a
personal<00:01:39.000> preference<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.820> say<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
personal preference what I can say is

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.690 
personal preference what I can say is
that<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.990> works<00:01:43.170> nicely<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.799> floats<00:01:44.520> around

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that it works nicely it floats around

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.929 
that it works nicely it floats around
nicely<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.829> smoothly<00:01:46.829> moves<00:01:47.250> across<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
nicely and it smoothly moves across a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
nicely and it smoothly moves across a
surface<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> piece<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> paper<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.740> you

kind of strange i like to rest my mouse
on<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.669> and<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.879> really<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.629> sort<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.930> forced

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
mouse which maybe the whole the best

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.110 
mouse which maybe the whole the best
benefit<00:03:06.629> of<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:07.769> resting<00:03:08.609> your<00:03:08.700> hand<00:03:08.939> down

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
benefit of it as resting your hand down

benefit of it as resting your hand down
on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.389> mouse<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.569> really<00:03:10.109> not<00:03:10.469> a<00:03:10.530> good<00:03:10.829> way<00:03:11.159> to

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
on the mouse is really not a good way to

on the mouse is really not a good way to
do<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.659> fact<00:03:12.689> that<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.409> most

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
do it I do like the fact that that most

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.709 
do it I do like the fact that that most
of<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.889> time<00:03:14.099> is<00:03:14.310> I'm<00:03:14.430> resting<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.359> kind<00:03:15.629> of

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
of the time is I'm resting it it kind of

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.379 
of the time is I'm resting it it kind of
goes<00:03:16.049> off<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.560> an<00:03:16.769> angled<00:03:17.159> side<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:18.120> as<00:03:18.269> you

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
goes off to an angled side but as you

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.780 
goes off to an angled side but as you
can<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.750> from<00:03:18.930> my<00:03:19.109> logitech<00:03:19.650> mouse<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.220> get

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
can see from my logitech mouse I get

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.930 
can see from my logitech mouse I get
that<00:03:20.819> angle<00:03:21.359> as<00:03:21.479> well<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.699> however<00:03:23.699> this

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
that angle as well on it however this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.009 
that angle as well on it however this
one<00:03:24.440> could<00:03:25.440> be<00:03:25.470> used<00:03:25.829> by<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.069> left<00:03:26.430> hand<00:03:26.699> II<00:03:26.849> a

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
one could be used by a left hand II a

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.140 
one could be used by a left hand II a
left-handed<00:03:28.019> or<00:03:28.260> right-handed<00:03:28.530> person

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
left-handed or right-handed person

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.149 
left-handed or right-handed person
without<00:03:30.150> having<00:03:30.629> any<00:03:30.780> problems<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.949> if<00:03:32.010> you're

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
without having any problems so if you're

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.289 
without having any problems so if you're
left-handed<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.879> might<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.239> good

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
left-handed this might be a good

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.909 
left-handed this might be a good
solution<00:03:35.599> other<00:03:36.599> than<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.019> can't<00:03:37.530> say

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
solution other than that I can't say

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.140 
solution other than that I can't say
whole<00:03:38.099> lot<00:03:38.220> more<00:03:38.370> about<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.760> we're<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
whole lot more about it we're going to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.780 
whole lot more about it we're going to
be<00:03:39.239> putting<00:03:39.479> it<00:03:39.689> in<00:03:39.870> our<00:03:40.310> holiday<00:03:41.310> gift<00:03:41.579> guide
