00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.640
 hi hello everyone good my name is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.580
 diego and I bring you this new video 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 4d cinema tutorial I have the version 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.210
 of re 13 how to make an an animation 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.699
 in any project that they have 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.270
 any created object can make a 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.290
 animation of this 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 so we're going to file to open for 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.280
 select the project that we have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.570
 I have a dashboard 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.570
 this and the animation that I did was this 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.880
 and an animation 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:20.149
 it's not so complex it's 120 frames 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.149
 and good as you see I put shadow 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 how are you seeing now 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.520
 so is this board of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.689
 with shadows with lighting and so on 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.640
 so good to create an animation 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.520
 we go here to camera 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.979
 here on camera to be inside the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.140
 camera we select this box that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.040
 is the object camera that is left blank 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.740
 so good as you see here there is a rule 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.290
 of 120 frames good here you guys if 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.970
 they want you can put 300 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.159
 300 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.289
 here they drag up to 300 already 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.599
 being between the goat we are going to do 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.599
 click here to create a keyframe 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.960
 then we drag on for example 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.360
 up to frame 40 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.160
 Y 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.110
 we are where we want to do the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.440
 next frame and we click on 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.860
 new 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.320
 then as you will see 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.530
 we already made the animation if I put him 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.530
 play 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.210
 how do you see up there 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.360
 and now I'm going to do 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.500
 and pass like the animation that I had to 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.500
 pass through 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.420
 of the pawns of the file of the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.930
 pawns he had 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.319
 it's going to be a frame here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.319
 and then I'm going to do another one at the end 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.090
 We do not run up to 100 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.480
 and it is here 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.209
 and here is a good click, let's go back 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.390
 back we go well let's give it to 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.390
 play 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.630
 this is the animation we are going to leave in 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.950
 100 then so it's not so long 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.319
 the animation 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 already as they see being inside the camera 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.310
 every click the little box that I told them 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.520
 can they do this 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.390
 animation now how to save this 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.090
 animation and how to save it in a video 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.510
 to upload them to youtube or wherever they want 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.520
 we just go here in configurations in 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.000
 good output and they give it the format that 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.349
 want the format for ht youtube is 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.519
 thousand 280 x 768 resolution 72 pixels by 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.079
 inch and frame rate 30 here 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.289
 very important the range frames 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.500
 all frames from 0 to the 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.210
 5 to where have I put it here 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.370
 I left it at 100 since they have saved 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.720
 We look for the route I'm going to put 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.620
 desk you leave them like chess video 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:42.260
 good javi movie and see in the format 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.150
 of his stuff and the rest 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.370
 as well as it comes out good if you want to go 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.040
 by pausing the video to see the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.270
 configurations that I have 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.330
 already 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.620
 and now give it here in the middle where 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.620
 I would rent in the machine viewer 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.090
 this depends a lot on computers 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.690
 that you have now that you will go 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.690
 reusing 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:14.320
 frame by frame here cf two 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.320
 frames two of 101 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.160
 already so good is that you go 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.160
 reusing frame by frame 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.080
 I'm going to pause the video to show you 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.389
 Afterwards, when there is little left and 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.650
 show them how the animation looks like 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.650
 what happened and see you 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:42.020
 already good we go in the 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:44.900
 image or frame 98 using have 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.570
 gone as you can see 12 minutes to 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.550
 render sheen frames so 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.550
 I have a good computer render well 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.180
 and this is ending 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.180
 Programs 100 of 101 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.490
 using the last frame 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:16.139
 then this is over 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.560
 we go here where it says video chess 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.910
 we open it 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.010
 and this is what we have left 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.870
 young man who gives an animation of three 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:31.840
 seconds because there were only 100 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.969
 frames and remember that here the 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.929
 render options here 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:41.569
 we put you frame 30 speed 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:45.529
 30 per second 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:48.249
 that is, they would be three seconds three 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.249
 something like that 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:58.330
 so that depends a lot on the 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.670
 here in this time many of the 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.520
 frames that you want to put on it 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:06.340
 here you have speed frames 30 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.000
 per second to make an animation of 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.729
 10 seconds here I would have to put 300 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.210
 and I would do a 10 point animation 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:21.460
 so that more than anything easy for 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:25.830
 make an animation in cinema 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.830
 that would be all see you 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.220
 goodbye
