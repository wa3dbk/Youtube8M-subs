00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 believe they are busy with something else 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 it looks like they found what they were looking for 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.549

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.999
 but it's my operation and it's up to me to do it 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.669
 we only have one 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.049

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.749
