00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
photograph was made with the x-band

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.390 
photograph was made with the x-band
Hasselblad<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:15.780> gives<00:00:16.170> about<00:00:16.800> two<00:00:17.160> thirty

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
five Meg's length panoramic shot and I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
five Meg's length panoramic shot and I
was<00:00:20.550> having<00:00:20.789> trouble<00:00:20.939> composing<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
was having trouble composing it but this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.890 
was having trouble composing it but this
shot<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> think<00:00:23.310> works<00:00:23.550> fairly<00:00:23.820> well<00:00:24.029> because

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
shot I think works fairly well because

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.620 
shot I think works fairly well because
there's<00:00:25.320> interesting<00:00:25.680> detail<00:00:26.390> from<00:00:27.390> edge<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
there's interesting detail from edge to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
there's interesting detail from edge to
edge<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.380> composition<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> house

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
edge the composition in the house

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
edge the composition in the house
doesn't<00:00:29.609> Hamel<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> nasty<00:00:30.689> dead<00:00:31.109> space<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
doesn't Hamel is a nasty dead space I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.590 
doesn't Hamel is a nasty dead space I
found<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> very<00:00:32.550> difficult<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
found it very difficult to use this to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.470 
found it very difficult to use this to
photograph<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.700> but<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.239> seems

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
photograph people but I think it seems

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
photograph people but I think it seems
like<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> where<00:00:37.020> there's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> lot<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.530> people

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
like this where there's a lot of people

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.880 
like this where there's a lot of people
it<00:00:38.790> works<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:40.050> need<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> closer<00:00:40.530> look

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it works so well you need a closer look

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.569 
it works so well you need a closer look
here<00:00:41.100> start<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> reflections

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.900 

a<00:00:46.640> little<00:00:47.089> shot<00:00:47.359> of<00:00:47.390> that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.210 

so<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.570> make<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.170> print<00:00:51.590> I'm<00:00:51.800> giving<00:00:52.100> an

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
so to make this print I'm giving an

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.330 
so to make this print I'm giving an
overall<00:00:52.550> exposure<00:00:53.150> of<00:00:55.720> 105<00:00:56.720> seconds<00:00:57.470> at<00:00:57.740> f/8

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
overall exposure of 105 seconds at f/8

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.880 
overall exposure of 105 seconds at f/8
with<00:00:58.880> filter<00:00:59.390> three<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.080> a<00:01:00.140> half<00:01:00.350> I<00:01:00.680> have<00:01:00.830> a

with filter three and a half I have a
multi<00:01:01.190> great<00:01:01.370> head<00:01:01.580> on<00:01:01.610> my<00:01:01.850> enlarger<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:02.780> then

multi great head on my enlarger and then
I'm<00:01:03.860> using<00:01:03.890> two<00:01:04.370> burning<00:01:04.640> masks<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:06.350> burn<00:01:06.650> in

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
I'm using two burning masks to burn in

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.940 
I'm using two burning masks to burn in
the<00:01:08.540> white<00:01:09.080> areas<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.710> prints<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.950> this

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the white areas of the prints so this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.610 
the white areas of the prints so this
mask<00:01:13.220> here<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.270> second<00:01:14.990> mask<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.470> it's

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
mask here is the second mask and it's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.560 
mask here is the second mask and it's
used<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.610> everywhere<00:01:17.030> there's<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.270> cutout

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
used so everywhere there's a cutout

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.600 
used so everywhere there's a cutout
that's<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.110> burned<00:01:18.320> out<00:01:18.500> area<00:01:18.830> where<00:01:19.490> it's

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
that's the burned out area where it's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the burning you can see there's you can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.660 
the burning you can see there's you can
get<00:01:35.030> detail<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:35.660> there

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670

the<00:01:38.060> second<00:01:38.480> mask<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:39.830> for<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.220> areas<00:01:40.490> that

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
the second mask is for the areas that

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.380 
the second mask is for the areas that
are<00:01:40.730> a<00:01:40.760> little<00:01:40.820> bit<00:01:41.000> more<00:01:41.120> gray<00:01:41.570> or<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:43.520> woman

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
figure on the left here this is where a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.240 
figure on the left here this is where a
child<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.720> woman<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.110> here<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.160> I'll

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
child is and the woman is here so I'll

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.090 
child is and the woman is here so I'll
give<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.520> 45<00:01:49.760> seconds<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.810> whole<00:01:51.800> mask

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
give it 45 seconds for this whole mask

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.690 
give it 45 seconds for this whole mask
and<00:01:52.550> I'll<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.870> dodge<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:55.070> woman<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.400> figure

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and I'll just dodge the woman to figure

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.200 
and I'll just dodge the woman to figure
out<00:01:56.200> after<00:01:57.200> 25<00:01:57.890> seconds<00:01:58.340> she<00:01:58.430> only<00:01:58.550> gets<00:01:58.670> 25

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
out after 25 seconds she only gets 25

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.320 
out after 25 seconds she only gets 25
and<00:01:59.600> everything<00:02:00.380> else<00:02:00.500> gets<00:02:00.740> 45<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:02.120> one

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
and everything else gets 45 this one

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.830 
and everything else gets 45 this one
here

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
here

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.190 
here
everything<00:02:03.440> gets<00:02:03.590> two<00:02:04.040> minutes

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
everything gets two minutes

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.310 
everything gets two minutes
so<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.260> end<00:02:07.470> up<00:02:07.680> burning<00:02:08.750> quite<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:10.080> because

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
so I end up burning quite a bit because

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.990 
so I end up burning quite a bit because
my<00:02:11.100> burning<00:02:11.490> time<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:12.060> also<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.810> stuff

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
my burning time is also one up stuff

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
great zero so three and a half for this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.780 
great zero so three and a half for this

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
grade zero which gives fills its in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.060 
grade zero which gives fills its in
nicely<00:02:32.490> otherwise<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:34.080> would<00:02:34.290> become<00:02:34.440> even

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
nicely otherwise this would become even

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.560 
nicely otherwise this would become even
with<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.280> Bernie<00:02:35.490> would<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> brighter

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
with the Bernie would be a brighter

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.530 
with the Bernie would be a brighter
white<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.459> by<00:02:38.459> putting<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.820> on<00:02:38.850> zero<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
white and by putting it on zero I get a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.390 
white and by putting it on zero I get a
nice<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.110> gray<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.860> kind<00:02:41.310> of

nice kind of gray in there that kind of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.350 
nice kind of gray in there that kind of
blends<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:42.450> doesn't<00:02:42.810> stand<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.170> too<00:02:43.410> much<00:02:44.360> but

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360

on<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.480> yet<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.410> took<00:03:01.530> at<00:03:01.680> an<00:03:01.770> idea<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.400> what

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
on this yet it took at an idea of what

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.090 
on this yet it took at an idea of what
the<00:03:03.510> final<00:03:03.660> print<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.290> when<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.709> see<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the final print is like when you see the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.010 
the final print is like when you see the
video<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.489> show<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:06.720> gives<00:03:06.930> you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
video of the show but this gives you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.710 
video of the show but this gives you
kind<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.190> understanding<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
kind of a understanding of what the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.470 
kind of a understanding of what the
process<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.410> at<00:03:10.530> least<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.830> me<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:12.150> quite

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
process is at least for me it's quite

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.240 
process is at least for me it's quite
involved<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.290> mean<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.830> an<00:03:13.920> all-night

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
involved I mean this is an all-night

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.570 
involved I mean this is an all-night
thing<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.530> where<00:03:16.530> continues<00:03:17.010> we'll<00:03:17.220> work<00:03:17.340> on

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
thing and where continues we'll work on

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.720 
thing and where continues we'll work on
it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.920 
it
I<00:03:17.910> keep<00:03:18.780> notes<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.850> every<00:03:20.850> step<00:03:21.150> along<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.900> way

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
I keep notes of every step along the way

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.259 
I keep notes of every step along the way
so<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.160> recreate<00:03:23.580> what<00:03:23.880> I've<00:03:24.000> done

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
so that I can recreate what I've done

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.190 
so that I can recreate what I've done
and<00:03:25.080> here's<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.890> enlarger<00:03:26.870> it's<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> multi

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and here's the enlarger it's a multi

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.160 
and here's the enlarger it's a multi
great<00:03:28.380> head<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:28.830> I'm<00:03:28.950> able<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:30.019> switch<00:03:31.019> it

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
great head so I'm able to switch it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.130 
great head so I'm able to switch it
around<00:03:31.580> but<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.570> three<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> half

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
around but I this is three and a half

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.250 
around but I this is three and a half
and<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.590> later<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.340> down<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.760> zero

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
and then I later on I go down to zero

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.590 
and then I later on I go down to zero
when<00:03:37.260> I'm<00:03:37.350> doing<00:03:37.590> my<00:03:37.709> burning<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:39.269> hopefully

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
when I'm doing my burning so hopefully

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.300 
when I'm doing my burning so hopefully
that<00:03:39.720> helps<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.080> understand<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:40.920> I'm<00:03:41.040> doing

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
that helps you understand what I'm doing

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.770 
that helps you understand what I'm doing
a<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:41.549> bit<00:03:42.470> as<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:44.519> burning<00:03:45.000> my<00:03:45.150> prints

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
a little bit as to burning my prints

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.830 
a little bit as to burning my prints
okay<00:03:46.380> bye<00:03:46.680> bye
