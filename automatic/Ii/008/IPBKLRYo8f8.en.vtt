and<00:03:41.709> also<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.400> good<00:03:42.729> counter<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.299> stop<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.689> power

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
and also a good counter to stop in power

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.559

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
maybe fuck takeout stealth all together

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.300 
maybe fuck takeout stealth all together
why<00:04:37.270> do<00:04:37.330> we<00:04:37.480> need<00:04:37.630> it<00:04:37.810> although<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> wouldn't<00:04:39.100> be

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
why do we need it although I wouldn't be

it you know the main part is to counter
just<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.680> UAV<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:49.090> pro<00:04:49.270> part<00:04:49.540> would<00:04:49.810> be

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
just the UAV and the pro part would be

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.270
