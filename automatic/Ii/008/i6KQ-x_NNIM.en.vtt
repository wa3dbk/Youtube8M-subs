 today I bring you a general question 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.590
 they can make them the most 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:23.470
 smart, well, well, let's go 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.439
 to bring the answer here 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.529
 overconsumption anything is 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.380
 harmful is to say for example take 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.930
 a scientist 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.609
 like what you drink a beer is good 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.399
 in fact the beer when then the 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.410
 excessive physical exercise a beer te 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.680
 helps you to get more quickly in 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.019
 excess is bad a glass of wine is 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.390
 good for circulation is good for 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.570
 the excess heart can cause you 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 a liver cirrhosis but more things 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.380
 video games are good because you 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.610
 They help speed up the mind and help you 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.060
 I was more attentive and with anything 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 such as videogames 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 unfortunately it is the last hobby that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 it has always been looked down upon by many 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.340
 for example parents that is to say is that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.520
 you play a lot and maybe you play 30 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 minutes one hour worth they come with the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.000
 video games a waste of time now 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.550
 well I for example is very adult but 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 very much of the people who see us is 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.740
 teenage people who live with parents 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.300
 but there is one thing that is sure and that is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.720
 after the video you have in the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.970
 description of alliance apps 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.830
 It will change your opinion about it can 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.520
 be beneficial to our lives the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.040
 video game 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.369
 they make us smarter because the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.380
 answer is positive affirmative and here 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.450
 You find examples such as 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.509
 example play 30 minutes for 2 months 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.210
 a super mario 64 can improve your 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.320
 memory your motor skills and also 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.990
 with strategic planning 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.700
 it's impressive it's true that there 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 studies that show that 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 videogames streamline the mind make you 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.800
 be more attentive for example I am a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.200
 person that I love, I'm passionate about 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.270
 revolution in shooters as per 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.270
 example with the duty yes that is true 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.209
 when you play, for example, they tend to 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.760
 play an hour and a half hour a day to 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.350
 these games 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.540
 you can be sure that I was 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.700
 more attentive because because only the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.360
 fact of playing a game for 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.820
 example are you playing a game of that 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.489
 all against all that what I liked 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.100
 much to have to be attentive to see where 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.820
 there is the enemy 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.420
 makes you increase your reflexes and in a 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:54.540
 everyday situation becomes very notorious 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.540
 In fact, I have not played for many months 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.590
 to consoles for work that does not 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.750
 I have no time to win either and it shows 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.420
 very much that before they had the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.530
 skills that were very notorious and that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.070
 Now, they are a little 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.160
 atrophied the video games are good 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.590
 are shown by studies that are 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.830
 very good and especially young minds 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.200
 that are in the process of evolution 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.020
 but also everything that is in excess 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.580
 it's human, so it's good, guys 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.990
 teach the video to your parents and 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.630
 if you do not forgive yourselves for 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.180
 convince them that when you have children 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.890
 tell them to play everything you want but 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.830
 not in excess because video games 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.239
 can speed our mind a month or 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.170
 of all guys if we see ourselves aladro
