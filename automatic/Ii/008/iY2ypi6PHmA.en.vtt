00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
moving on 13 megapixel camera you can

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.880 
moving on 13 megapixel camera you can
see<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.600> focuses<00:03:35.050> really<00:03:35.230> nicely<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.709> the

see it focuses really nicely on the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.430 
see it focuses really nicely on the

crease in the HTC one case here using

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.630 
crease in the HTC one case here using
that<00:03:38.560> as<00:03:38.650> an<00:03:38.740> example<00:03:39.010> let's<00:03:39.280> see<00:03:39.370> if<00:03:39.459> we<00:03:39.520> can

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
that as an example let's see if we can

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.300 
that as an example let's see if we can
get<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.820> focused<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.209> on<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.390> text<00:03:40.630> and

not<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.320> maybe<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> most

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
not that this is maybe the most

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.350 
not that this is maybe the most
economical<00:04:56.730> way<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.880> do<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.270> but<00:04:57.450> hey<00:04:58.170> they're

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
economical way to do it but hey they're

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.030 
economical way to do it but hey they're
probably<00:05:00.360> hard<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.870> take<00:05:01.080> notes<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:01.800> your

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
probably hard to take notes if your

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.350 
probably hard to take notes if your
professor<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.520> typing<00:05:02.850> faster<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.240> you're

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
professor is typing faster if you're

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.910 
professor is typing faster if you're
gonna<00:05:03.450> work<00:05:03.690> meeting<00:05:04.080> but<00:05:04.530> really<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> nice

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
gonna work meeting but really a nice

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.020 
gonna work meeting but really a nice
little<00:05:05.070> feature<00:05:05.340> there<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.580> think<00:05:05.670> that's<00:05:05.820> kind

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
little feature there I think that's kind

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.350 
little feature there I think that's kind
of<00:05:06.060> cool

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
of cool

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.790 
of cool
and<00:05:06.450> something<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.020> distinguishes<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.770> from

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
and something that distinguishes it from

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.680 
and something that distinguishes it from

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
part one it's been on edge the entire

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.790 
part one it's been on edge the entire
time<00:06:08.280> this<00:06:08.430> does<00:06:08.610> support<00:06:08.910> HSDPA<00:06:09.690> on<00:06:10.020> AT&amp;T<00:06:10.440> and

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
time this does support HSDPA on AT&amp;T and

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.260 
time this does support HSDPA on AT&amp;T and
on<00:06:10.950> t-mobile<00:06:11.280> so<00:06:11.550> not<00:06:11.670> quite<00:06:11.820> sure<00:06:11.910> why<00:06:12.240> it's

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
on t-mobile so not quite sure why it's

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.810 
on t-mobile so not quite sure why it's
sticking<00:06:12.750> an<00:06:12.870> edge<00:06:13.190> APNs<00:06:14.190> look<00:06:14.370> good<00:06:14.550> it's

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
sticking an edge APNs look good it's

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.940 
sticking an edge APNs look good it's
running<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.270> APN<00:06:15.660> and<00:06:15.930> AT&amp;T<00:06:16.200> actually<00:06:16.770> the

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
running the APN and AT&amp;T actually the

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.100 
running the APN and AT&amp;T actually the
old<00:06:17.100> singular<00:06:17.580> APN<00:06:18.000> which<00:06:18.600> works<00:06:18.840> fine<00:06:19.050> for

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
old singular APN which works fine for

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.860 
old singular APN which works fine for
HSDPA<00:06:20.010> so<00:06:20.130> not<00:06:20.430> quite<00:06:20.550> sure<00:06:20.760> why<00:06:21.480> that's<00:06:21.690> not

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
HSDPA so not quite sure why that's not

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.210 
HSDPA so not quite sure why that's not
