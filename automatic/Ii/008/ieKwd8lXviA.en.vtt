 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.580
 Today's oakley news we have today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.890
 state of decay minecraft and again 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.890
 what is the b standalone much fun 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.910
 yes state of decay it should be yes or something 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.890
 already announced that the break down 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 dlc should come out soon it was not 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 called it was called now and that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 29 november 2013, the dlc 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.170
 appear for streaming so synonymous for pc 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.940
 and for xbox 360 and yes to the dlc 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.829
 better and I know that should again 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 correct the weibel aspects 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.040
 highlight that means next to the campaign 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.260
 then try again independently 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.500
 Group to live as long as possible 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.149
 be hold 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 his group you get the stop 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.670
 live as long as possible 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 expand to maintain and so on and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.499
 that's just one of the things that comes with it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.240
 and yes it should be about seven 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:08.130
 dollar will probably cost 119 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 translated into euros means seven euros 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 if you 're lucky, five euros and wise 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.829
 not yes and as I said on 29 november 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.759
 is it so far I am looking forward to it 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.659
 I finally have it myself and come 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.340
 probably at some point that too 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.029
 video too probably extra then too 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.349
 breakdown 

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:30.749
 we look there we come to minecraft 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:33.119
 the story of mojang or mobbing or 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.529
 the Slovene is pronounced there 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.359
 was now a documentary 

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:38.249
 published that means exactly 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:43.439
 this name has minecraft story of 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:48.239
 magic and came gently from 2012 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.369
 but it tasted right there 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.679
 read and 12 US dollars 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.649
 and you can get it for free now 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.389
 on youtube, you know youtube 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.840
 some of you think I have one more time 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:02.610
 heard and goes 104 minutes and it works 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.870
 stop 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.220
 the insight behind the scenes and 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.180
 also about the privacy of markus 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:17.300
 So Persson is probably whole 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.520
 make it more interesting if I have time 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.830
 we would now come to the daisies 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.190
 Semmler yes there are now 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.820
 very often news too and the only one 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.470
 Obstacle was all bugs lately 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.000
 is growing and they are still and 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.000
 now is probably the last obstacle 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.880
 the bug fixes the performance 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.330
 to increase again that means bugs too 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.080
 to take out the performance 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.020
 to decrease 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.540
 So you know well the team knows well 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.040
 directly which bugs are everything and how 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.520
 you solve that so there is none 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.890
 problems 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.000
 the only problem is the time required 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.280
 to solve the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.500
 and yes, it's still pretty strong 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.440
 performance of the reason as I said and you 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 want on the fps the pictures pro 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.100
 second to at least fifteen pictures 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.200
 per second with 50 players 2000 zombies 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.750
 and 25 minutes 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.239
 25,000 blood items bring such and such 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.530
 they wanted that as a minimum at least 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.010
 I do not think they 've got that well yet 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.010
 it must be really kottig still running and 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.380
 yes, just solve smaller bugs as well 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.870
 also the performance problems 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.150
 cause and now they come 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.310
 ensure only 27 players 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.790
 yes and what is special 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.790
 highlights is how they say it here 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.370
 the excellent 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.450
 improvements to the pathing outdoors 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.099
 of zombies from the zombie ki and im 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.200
 inside so within buildings 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.930
 it probably still in need of improvement, though 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.329
 already improved is already 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.340
 what you have the zombie pathfinding was already 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.510
 always the last shit there you are happy 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:58.489
 yes and the problem is now 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.750
 new performance and so yes exactly 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.430
 Rottal still thought 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.780
 He still has some problems with that 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.850
 inventory system there you have a few 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.500
 You made mistakes later 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.340
 If you have the idea you can fix it 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.010
 Stand alone not again 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.060
 wants to move 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.410
 that means different that's not 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.120
 probably announced as well 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.530
 better that way but all in all that is 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.090
 inventory system really 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.550
 huge step forward so there 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.930
 he promises much but is 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.500
 currently not 100 percent 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.270
 satisfied 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.520
 but these are all things that are coming 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.170
 then in retrospect is yes is only 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.980
 alpha i think they have already got out 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.560
 can hew 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.990
 I mean alphabetically there is always 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.030
 flame hater and i'm talking again 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.220
 far too much about the subtle pay as 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.770
 yes always leave again your 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.650
 comments that he did that for the vip news 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.220
 yes as I said that comments what 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.380
 do you think about fucking and yes 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.290
 By the way , ever vanilla milkshake 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.680
 with sims tastes saugeil can only 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.450
 recommend 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.830
 and yes that's it, thanks for 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.810
 spectators looked until next time 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.810
 Crack it differently and watch it until then
