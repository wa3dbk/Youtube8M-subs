00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.370
 It is said that you should not listen to products that are widely introduced to you today 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.169
 I'm wondering something like Urawa Kasumi Hanada 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.159
 Bought by 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.679
 It is 100 yen 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.980
 Thank you very much, Mr. Ohmune. It's amazing. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.480
 I enjoyed it 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.179
 The bridge is lost every day 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.589
 You may have come before 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:25.930
 If you want to see 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.349
 I think there are more 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.439
 I have a history I want to introduce this a little 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.899
 The current card of Goryo in Japan was made in Nakazawa Edo period 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:36.620
 is not it 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.970
 Such feeling 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.289
 Because it is made of real flower tag 1 paper 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.519
 It is a little difference in texture, but this is before 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:45.580
 Gold coin 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.360
 vinyl 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.950
 Tell 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 It is made of things 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 There are a total of 48 cards 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.949
 It is Italy but it is also 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 Take the cards in order 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.130
 It is worthwhile to be able to play a role quickly 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.760
 On the Prague cushions of Oshika-cho Mitai 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590
 I do it, but 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.009
 Japanese language 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.509
 So this is a blogging 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.080
 Please pull something 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 I understand 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.810
 And 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 Take advantage of the river country 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.150
 But take down 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.550
 Morning 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.650
 I waited a little expensive 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.870
 It was said that she was treating 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.670
 Even in Japan 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.020
 24 minutes 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.140
 In general 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.500
 It is usual 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.950
 Like this 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.210
 Line up like this 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.410
 One's usual 121312 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.520
 We let you perform tag which we want you to perform in Oita city and take 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.220
 What 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.050
 I will go this 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.409
 I think it is Niigata 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020
 If this 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.750
 If it is a Hino city person, the story is this 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
 Laugh and 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 Tall 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.809
 It has been said that 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.839
 Then I said that itliketo was my opponent 7th 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.489
 I am Sakurazawa Run 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.430
 We also eat cats. 720 points 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.299
 Sang 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.989
 And if you make a role, you can quickly 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.879
 Because the score is different depending on the number of players who have won the Japanese movie and the total score 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.299
 It seems that total score can be done 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.199
 Because these are very simple foreign films that passed away 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.059
 Do you have fun or something that has never changed? 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.459
 It is not good to try it at a 100 yen shop 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.289
 It is about 600 yen for foreigners, so it's also a souvenir 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:53.659
 It will be 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.909
 Please try to play plava
