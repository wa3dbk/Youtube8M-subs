prediction video I'm going to go with

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.180 
prediction video I'm going to go with
Mikkel<00:02:51.750> Kessler<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.440> Mikkel<00:02:52.650> Kessler<00:02:52.680> is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
Mikkel Kessler I think Mikkel Kessler is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.070 
Mikkel Kessler I think Mikkel Kessler is
the<00:02:53.430> better<00:02:53.610> technical<00:02:54.000> boxer<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.630> think<00:02:54.990> he

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
the better technical boxer I think he

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.450 
the better technical boxer I think he
has<00:02:55.200> better<00:02:55.380> skills<00:02:55.830> um<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:58.130> he<00:02:59.130> won<00:02:59.310> in

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
has better skills um you know he won in

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.160 
has better skills um you know he won in
unanimous<00:03:00.030> decision<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:00.720> time<00:03:01.020> around

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
unanimous decision the first time around

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.600 
unanimous decision the first time around
so<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.710> kind<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.890> hard<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> go<00:03:02.220> against<00:03:02.520> in

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so it's kind of hard to go against in

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.150 
so it's kind of hard to go against in
the<00:03:02.700> second<00:03:03.060> time<00:03:03.590> Carl<00:03:04.590> Froch<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:04.980> pretty

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the second time Carl Froch is pretty

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.560 
the second time Carl Froch is pretty
much<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.340> same<00:03:05.550> fighter<00:03:05.880> he's<00:03:06.210> gotten<00:03:06.540> better

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
much the same fighter he's gotten better

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.570 
much the same fighter he's gotten better
just<00:03:07.080> as<00:03:07.200> well<00:03:07.350> as<00:03:07.440> Mikkel<00:03:07.680> Kessler<00:03:07.710> has<00:03:08.250> I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
just as well as Mikkel Kessler has I

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.670 
just as well as Mikkel Kessler has I
just<00:03:09.240> still<00:03:09.780> think<00:03:10.080> making<00:03:10.230> clusters

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
just still think making clusters

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.170 
just still think making clusters
probably<00:03:11.340> good<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.490> know<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.060> his

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
probably good you know going to have his

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.730 
probably good you know going to have his
number<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.630> night<00:03:12.840> unless<00:03:13.080> Carl<00:03:13.470> Froch

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
number that night unless Carl Froch

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.650 
number that night unless Carl Froch
lands<00:03:13.980> something<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.460> hurt<00:03:14.640> them<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.970> think

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
lands something to hurt them I think

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.180 
lands something to hurt them I think
Mikkel<00:03:15.900> Kessler<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.800> take<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
Mikkel Kessler is going to take the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.370 
Mikkel Kessler is going to take the
