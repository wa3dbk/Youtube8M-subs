00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.920
 is 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.250
 the evening scanner 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.460
 a white sheet is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.550
 we l 3d on the computer 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.470
 different software is talking about 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.690
 internet and we will get a file 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.750
 preexisting on sites like sin 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.310
 various who are like flickr for 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 but for 3d models so it's 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.060
 3d models sharing sites or 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.920
 models to exchange for free on the 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.940
 net and prevents them from those of this 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.470
 file recovery method 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.380
 it is that we can follow the evolution 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.500
 files since only one file 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.809
 is not fixed there may be 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 different versions of the same model is 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.239
 thus improvements in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.720
 optimizations for this or that 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.559
 machine 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.120
 so this is it's finally the way the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.589
 more efficient and most commonly 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.589
 used to recover a 3d model 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.620
 we find everything since finally 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.550
 3D printing today allows for 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.950
 do pretty much everything so we go from 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.470
 figurines up to the architecture in 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.070
 going through mechanical elements or 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
 even the artistic objections so 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 color the field of possibilities is 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 really remains 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.310
 as well amateurs who want 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.100
 let's say amateur pro programs 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.510
 that they say they have a little bit of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.130
 so still technology of 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.490
 Information on the computer 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.040
 software as well as the technique of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.690
 the machine that professionals and 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.030
 including architects or offices 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.500
 mechanical studies that need 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.530
 so that they find in these solutions 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.420
 3d printing means of 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.230
 prototype and quickly and finally to 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.230
 low 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.790
 Appointment 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.400
 two thousand euros VAT included with consumable 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.810
 to start so for less than 2000 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.220
 euros you have more how these 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 printed checkered station 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.260
 our materials pliers whose bobby 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.610
 of plastic finally about a kilo 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.830
 so we hang on the back of the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.330
 machine and you have to know that with a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
 small lot of plastic can be produced 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 more than 300 chess pieces 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
 it's finally going to be heated 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.200
 to more than 200 degrees to stand out so 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.750
 life and 3 mm so eventually if that's 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.470
 1.75 mm in diameter and it will come out 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.830
 nozzles just before being printed 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.530
 10.4 him or her and then to have 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.090
 finesse impressions of the layers that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.840
 will go up to 0.1 mm so without microphone 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.170
 so here we have a model that is in the process 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.990
 to be prepared for printing a 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.080
 time this cutting work completed on 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.120
 file is inserted on a sd card and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.120
 after we give it to the influential
