what<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.509> did<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:13.110> after<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.040> previous<00:00:14.370> video

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
what I did was after the previous video

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.359 
what I did was after the previous video
that<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.059> made<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.870> thinking<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.619> lot<00:00:17.100> about

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that I made I was thinking a lot about

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.580 
that I made I was thinking a lot about
the<00:00:18.060> fact<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:18.900> these<00:00:19.050> stamps

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the fact that I have all these stamps

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.679 
the fact that I have all these stamps
and<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.189> not<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.640> making<00:00:20.939> much<00:00:21.449> use

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
and that I'm not really making much use

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.920 
and that I'm not really making much use
of<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> decorate<00:00:23.939> my<00:00:24.269> Filofax

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
of them so I like to decorate my Filofax

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.640 
of them so I like to decorate my Filofax
but<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> same<00:00:26.130> time<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.810> don't<00:00:27.810> always<00:00:28.289> have

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
but at the same time I don't always have

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.609 
but at the same time I don't always have
my<00:00:29.039> stamps<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:29.910> ink<00:00:30.119> pads<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.570> hand<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
my stamps and my ink pads on hand so I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.260 
my stamps and my ink pads on hand so I
can't<00:00:32.070> always<00:00:32.340> decorate<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> way<00:00:33.180> I'd

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
can't always decorate it the way I'd

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.810 
can't always decorate it the way I'd
like<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.500> would<00:00:34.739> stamp<00:00:35.070> directly<00:00:35.640> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
like and if I would stamp directly in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.139 
like and if I would stamp directly in
the<00:00:36.329> Filofax<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.170> pages<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.770> quite<00:00:38.190> thin<00:00:38.219> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the Filofax the pages are quite thin so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.619 
the Filofax the pages are quite thin so
the<00:00:39.540> ink<00:00:40.260> would<00:00:40.649> bleed<00:00:40.860> through<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the ink would bleed through so what I

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.900 
the ink would bleed through so what I
thought<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.230> seeing<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.489> I've<00:00:44.730> been

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
thought is seeing of it as I've been

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.729 
thought is seeing of it as I've been
using<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> washi<00:00:45.660> tape<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.530> that's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
using all this washi tape and that's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.479 
using all this washi tape and that's
allowed<00:00:47.039> me<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.340> use<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:49.489> permanent

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
allowed me to use I have more permanent

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.630 
allowed me to use I have more permanent
markers<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.420> things<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:52.430> sharpies<00:00:53.430> like

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
markers or things like sharpies like

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.150 
markers or things like sharpies like
this<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> thin<00:00:55.739> point<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.800> thought<00:00:58.800> hey

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
this so with a thin point I thought hey

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
this so with a thin point I thought hey
it'd<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> great<00:00:59.789> idea<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.629> some

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it'd be a great idea if I can make some

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
it'd be a great idea if I can make some
stickers<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.710> either<00:01:01.829> write<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.460> or

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
stickers that I can either write on or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.850 
stickers that I can either write on or
add<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.970> for<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.299> snaps<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
add in for my snaps and so that's what I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
add in for my snaps and so that's what I
did<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.580> tried<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.240> couple<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.750> different

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
did and I tried a couple of different

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.420 
did and I tried a couple of different
things<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.040> first<00:01:12.830> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> stickers<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
things the first kind of stickers that I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
things the first kind of stickers that I
tried<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> me<00:01:14.939> we're<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.869> color

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
tried to me we're with these color

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030 
tried to me we're with these color
coding<00:01:17.040> labels<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.759> white<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> they

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
coding labels these are white and they

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.070 
coding labels these are white and they
came<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.960> like<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
came out like this so as you can see the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.060 
came out like this so as you can see the
image<00:01:25.380> isn't<00:01:25.590> crisp<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.610> used<00:01:27.110> regular<00:01:28.110> ink

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
image isn't crisp I used regular ink

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.420 
image isn't crisp I used regular ink
pads<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.590> they<00:01:31.590> came<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> little<00:01:32.220> bit

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
pads and they came out a little bit

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.780 
pads and they came out a little bit
distorted<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:34.110> quite<00:01:34.409> full<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> they

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
distorted or not quite full and they

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.210 
distorted or not quite full and they
took<00:01:35.970> an<00:01:36.210> excessively<00:01:37.020> long<00:01:37.110> time<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.770> dry<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
took an excessively long time to dry and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.429 
took an excessively long time to dry and
I<00:01:38.430> realize<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.049> labels

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
I realize it's because the labels

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.420 
I realize it's because the labels
themselves<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.729> ones<00:01:42.119> were<00:01:42.920> glossy<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
themselves these ones were glossy and I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
themselves these ones were glossy and I
didn't<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.149> necessarily<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.290> thought<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.680> was

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
didn't know necessarily I thought it was

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
didn't know necessarily I thought it was
just<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.130> shine<00:01:47.850> from<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> package<00:01:48.689> when<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
just a shine from the package when I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.950 
just a shine from the package when I
bought<00:01:49.140> them<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.909> they're<00:01:51.030> actually<00:01:51.210> quite

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
bought them but they're actually quite

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.630 
bought them but they're actually quite
shiny<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> realized<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
shiny and so I realized that this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.270 
shiny and so I realized that this
doesn't<00:01:53.909> work<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:56.479> stamps<00:01:57.950> directly<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
doesn't work for stamps directly on it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.499 
doesn't work for stamps directly on it
so<00:01:59.399> I'll<00:01:59.520> try<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.729> figure<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.240> else<00:02:00.390> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
so I'll try to figure out what else I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.959 
so I'll try to figure out what else I
can<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.439> stickers<00:02:01.880> for<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
can do with these stickers for the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
can do with these stickers for the
meantime<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.799> them

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
meantime I'm just going to put them

these so this is the tree so when I'm

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.040 
these so this is the tree so when I'm
outside<00:04:32.430> when<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.060> go<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.390> park<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.930> have

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.990 
outside when I go to the park and I have
picnics<00:04:34.500> things<00:04:34.710> like<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.010> i<00:04:35.070> can<00:04:35.340> kind<00:04:35.940> of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
picnics things like that i can kind of

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.750 
picnics things like that i can kind of
write<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.510> or<00:04:37.470> anything<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.490> do<00:04:38.610> with

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
nature i also made quite a few of these

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.170 
nature i also made quite a few of these
and<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.740> this<00:04:43.950> could<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.190> used<00:04:44.730> either<00:04:45.030> for

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
and so this could be used either for

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.130 
and so this could be used either for
meal<00:04:46.170> planning<00:04:46.530> or<00:04:47.390> if<00:04:48.390> i<00:04:48.900> want<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.740> write<00:04:49.920> my

that I want to try i can use these and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.850 
that I want to try i can use these and
then<00:04:58.590> write<00:04:59.100> on<00:04:59.220> them<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.520> stick<00:04:59.760> them<00:04:59.790> in

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
then write on them and stick them in

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.160 
then write on them and stick them in
made<00:05:01.860> some<00:05:01.890> of<00:05:02.160> these<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:03.540> was<00:05:03.690> actually<00:05:03.870> you

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
made some of these this was actually you

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.480 
made some of these this was actually you
can<00:05:04.290> see<00:05:04.470> a<00:05:04.500> little<00:05:04.650> bit<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.830> leftover<00:05:05.340> from

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
can see a little bit of leftover from

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.580 
can see a little bit of leftover from
the<00:05:05.550> sap<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:06.120> was<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.600> stamp<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.050> said<00:05:07.290> snail

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
the sap it was a stamp that said snail

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.060 
the sap it was a stamp that said snail
mail<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> just<00:05:08.880> tried<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.210> ink<00:05:09.510> up<00:05:09.690> the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
mail and so I just tried to ink up the

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.800 
mail and so I just tried to ink up the
part<00:05:11.070> where<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.310> said<00:05:11.490> mail<00:05:13.880> next<00:05:14.880> ok<00:05:15.750> so

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
part where it said mail next ok so

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.420 
part where it said mail next ok so
that's<00:05:16.140> for<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:17.630> pre-made<00:05:19.160> labels<00:05:20.160> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
that's for the the pre-made labels and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.700 
that's for the the pre-made labels and
then<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.300> took<00:05:22.370> some<00:05:23.370> leftover<00:05:24.260> pieces<00:05:25.260> of

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
then I took some leftover pieces of

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.010 
then I took some leftover pieces of
larger<00:05:26.250> sheets<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:27.150> you<00:05:27.210> know<00:05:27.419> those<00:05:27.600> when<00:05:27.990> you

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
larger sheets so you know those when you

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.450 
larger sheets so you know those when you
want<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.350> make<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:29.270> CD<00:05:30.270> or<00:05:30.480> DVD<00:05:31.230> labels<00:05:31.770> they

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
want to make a CD or DVD labels they

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.280 
want to make a CD or DVD labels they
usually<00:05:32.970> come<00:05:33.150> with<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.390> lot<00:05:33.540> of<00:05:33.570> extra<00:05:34.110> white

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
usually come with a lot of extra white

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.430 
usually come with a lot of extra white
space<00:05:34.320> around<00:05:34.680> either<00:05:35.250> pre<00:05:36.090> pre<00:05:36.750> cut<00:05:36.930> labels

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
space around either pre pre cut labels

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.800 
space around either pre pre cut labels
or<00:05:37.890> there's<00:05:38.160> just<00:05:38.370> like<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.700> extra<00:05:39.210> parts

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
or there's just like the extra parts

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.560 
or there's just like the extra parts
that<00:05:39.960> are<00:05:40.080> around<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.680> CD<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.540> because<00:05:42.540> I

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
that are around the CD and because I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.320 
that are around the CD and because I
don't<00:05:42.810> like<00:05:42.960> things<00:05:43.380> going<00:05:43.950> to<00:05:44.100> waste<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.760> cut

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
don't like things going to waste I cut

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.640 
don't like things going to waste I cut
them<00:05:45.450> out<00:05:45.570> i<00:05:45.630> leave<00:05:45.960> them<00:05:46.080> on<00:05:46.140> the<00:05:46.260> side<00:05:46.440> so

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
them out i leave them on the side so

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.370 
them out i leave them on the side so
this<00:05:46.800> was<00:05:46.950> one<00:05:47.130> of<00:05:47.160> them<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.960> if<00:05:48.960> you<00:05:49.050> can<00:05:49.200> see

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
this was one of them and if you can see

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.770 
this was one of them and if you can see
here<00:05:49.590> there's<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:49.830> really<00:05:50.340> big<00:05:50.780> rectangular

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
here there's a really big rectangular

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.390 
here there's a really big rectangular
label<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.380> then<00:05:52.470> two<00:05:52.620> smaller<00:05:52.950> ones<00:05:53.040> on<00:05:53.310> the

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
label and then two smaller ones on the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.640

are<00:05:57.360> small<00:05:57.900> enough<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.530> use<00:05:59.460> their<00:05:59.820> but<00:06:00.060> i'm

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
are small enough to use their but i'm

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.100 
are small enough to use their but i'm
i'm<00:06:00.390> still<00:06:00.960> thinking<00:06:00.990> about<00:06:01.440> how<00:06:02.370> i<00:06:02.400> can<00:06:02.789> use

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
i'm still thinking about how i can use

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.820 
i'm still thinking about how i can use
my<00:06:04.110> staff

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
my staff

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.890 
my staff
maybe<00:06:05.190> create<00:06:05.610> some<00:06:05.820> kind<00:06:06.000> of<00:06:06.180> made<00:06:06.600> something

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
maybe create some kind of made something

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.160 
maybe create some kind of made something
diagonal<00:06:07.650> I<00:06:07.860> don't<00:06:08.130> know<00:06:08.190> we'll<00:06:08.370> see<00:06:08.930> but<00:06:09.930> for

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
diagonal I don't know we'll see but for

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.530 
diagonal I don't know we'll see but for
now<00:06:10.260> I<00:06:10.500> found<00:06:10.830> this<00:06:11.010> big<00:06:11.550> one<00:06:11.760> was<00:06:12.270> big<00:06:12.510> enough

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
now I found this big one was big enough

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.560 
now I found this big one was big enough
to<00:06:12.810> fit<00:06:13.320> this<00:06:13.850> imagine<00:06:14.850> stuff<00:06:15.120> that<00:06:15.330> i<00:06:15.390> have

and i really like it because it's really

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.960 
and i really like it because it's really
intricate<00:06:18.150> there's<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.510> lot<00:06:18.840> of<00:06:18.870> detailing<00:06:19.440> and

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
point four millimeters and so i can use
