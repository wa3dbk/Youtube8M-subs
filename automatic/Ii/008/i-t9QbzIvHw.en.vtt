00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
couple of black cars and I thought well

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.570 
couple of black cars and I thought well
I'll<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.649> start<00:01:34.649> there<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.430> I

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
I'll just start there and then as I

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.029 
I'll just start there and then as I
researched<00:01:36.149> more<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.869> found<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.830> black

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039
