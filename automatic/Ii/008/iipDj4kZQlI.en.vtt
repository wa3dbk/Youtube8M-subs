00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.060 
was the one who jumped over before
Batista<00:01:56.310> got<00:01:56.460> drafted<00:01:56.700> over<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> SmackDown

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
Batista got drafted over to SmackDown

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.230 
Batista got drafted over to SmackDown
that<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.189> were<00:01:59.250> hoping<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.909> title

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that they were hoping that that title

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
that they were hoping that that title
was<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.600> brought<00:02:00.840> back<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
was going to be brought back and that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.880 
was going to be brought back and that
JBL<00:02:02.790> would<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> good<00:02:04.110> champion<00:02:04.530> again<00:02:04.770> on

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
JBL would be a good champion again on

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.609 
JBL would be a good champion again on
Smackdown<00:02:05.659> back<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.110> think<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.530> was

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
Smackdown back then I think that was

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
Smackdown back then I think that was
before<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.520> champion<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.420> would

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
before he was the champion so that would

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.119 
before he was the champion so that would
be<00:02:09.539> his<00:02:09.750> first<00:02:09.989> championship<00:02:10.470> run<00:02:10.739> around<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
asleep on Friday nights I think honestly

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.320 
asleep on Friday nights I think honestly
that's<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.430> one<00:04:50.610> thing<00:04:50.789> in<00:04:50.909> my<00:04:50.939> mind<00:04:51.180> that

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
that's the one thing in my mind that

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.129 
that's the one thing in my mind that
makes<00:04:51.569> the<00:04:51.719> most<00:04:51.870> sense<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:53.719> think<00:04:54.719> that

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
makes the most sense and I think that

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.529 
makes the most sense and I think that
they<00:04:55.710> do<00:04:55.770> do<00:04:56.039> it<00:04:56.189> this<00:04:56.340> way<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:56.819> think<00:04:57.419> there

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
they do do it this way I think there

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.809 
they do do it this way I think there
will<00:04:57.659> be<00:04:57.719> outraged<00:04:58.229> that<00:04:58.530> people<00:04:59.370> bought<00:04:59.669> this

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.999 
will be outraged that people bought this
pay-per-view<00:05:00.029> TLC<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.169> they<00:05:01.590> didn't<00:05:01.889> get<00:05:01.949> a

doing a double switch at the titles is

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.740 
doing a double switch at the titles is
how<00:06:02.789> I<00:06:02.819> think<00:06:03.089> they're<00:06:03.180> going<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.330> get<00:06:03.419> out<00:06:03.599> of

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
how I think they're going to get out of

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.360 
how I think they're going to get out of
this<00:06:03.839> because<00:06:04.589> they've<00:06:04.830> never<00:06:04.860> said

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
this because they've never said

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.610 
this because they've never said
unification<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.330> they<00:06:06.960> never<00:06:07.139> said<00:06:07.379> anything

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
unification and they never said anything

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.570 
unification and they never said anything
else<00:06:07.979> so<00:06:08.909> I<00:06:08.939> think<00:06:09.120> honestly<00:06:10.159> you<00:06:11.159> just<00:06:11.460> have

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
else so I think honestly you just have

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.929 
else so I think honestly you just have
this<00:06:11.610> sort<00:06:11.969> of<00:06:12.029> like<00:06:12.180> stunned<00:06:12.569> thing<00:06:12.900> how

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:13.939 
this sort of like stunned thing how

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.740 
this sort of like stunned thing how
