 Let's go in our milk powder bank. 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.059
 I have a kilo of flour and I have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 here is 150 grams of butter, we have to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:24.800
 butter to stay tastier is that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.420
 I also have 150 grams of sugar 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.089
 together it also studies that the process is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 direct is the one that you go with everything 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.180
 together mix experience tire rise 2 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.309
 the direct process has no need 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 to make sponge the revenue does not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.309
 misses that I also have 50 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.149
 grams of powdered milk powdered milk without 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.660
 sugar 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.520
 preferably is to love is personal path 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 talk a lot about her but she also has 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.399
 which I think is very good too 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:03.030
 here I have 15 grams of salt 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:10.310
 I have three egg yolks and I have 70 grams of 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:15.240
 yeast or biological yeast 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.470
 way I love basic travel because the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.420
 business is ugly and here I have too 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 500ml people milk milk we talk 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.979
 that is cml but at least you do not use 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.979
 everything then you have to put of little 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.880
 for you is a bit more humble have to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.280
 make it a little drier 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.399
 if you put it all at once you can 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 take the risk you can not give 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.860
 account of its mass then goes 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.710
 slowly understood to put gradually 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.710
 the tchan 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:07.330
 the year began in a terrible but part 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:11.530
 né sic is very tasty and is one more 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:15.370
 Professional is done in the same bakery. 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.550
 What happens is that the staff when 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.120
 It goes quickly at the bakery because it is 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.200
 very hot, you will do more in 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.420
 them in the road do not crush 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.690
 I took a look at my milk is 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.640
 making people can not warm up 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.130
 otherwise you kill human suffering adin 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.140
 be the book only then it will grow goes 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.030
 complain if you taught me background in 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.790
 certain is not 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.140
 despite following the rules right looks 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.530
 I do not go the way I do not use 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:56.160
 I do not think I'm going to use all the milk 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.230
 slowly I'll hold my here 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.440
 until we even point the league as we with 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.860
 You then take a look at our 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.590
 joão costa on our bread to the point here only 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.540
 That's clear, there's more left for you. 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.239
 develop the gluten it okay 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.459
 I'm going to just go and rest for 20 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.150
 minutes later we model the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.299
 Ours our bishop is ours 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.310
 breads like me have no space here right? 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.670
 filming I've done more or less just to 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.320
 You understand that you will open and will do 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.200
 this here 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:42.430
 The secret is sure to make your 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:58.630
 six years do what you see and will 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:04:00.090
 get huge an idea just is 180graus 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.129
 time 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.880
 20 minutes is just that to not 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.040
 stay dry 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.390
 gives a glimpse in our clear that the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.240
 People will not even compare my 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.240
 when the bakery is in the sense of beauty 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.170
 remembering something else is his texture 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.440
 it is very soft very soft 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.290
 only that it is clear that in the bakery 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.030
 they sell with a roll as a 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.580
 special flour 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.030
 we usually buy the kind one 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.700

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.690

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.010
 if I'm not mistaken, it's for every one kilo 10 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.460
 Grams if I'm not mistaken. 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.480
 You're to love for your flour to stay with. 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.900

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:51.490

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.060
