00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 So I do is grab the stick in a book to play this naturally 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 It's a fast performance . 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.049
 I do not have to let my left hand die . 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.869
 Only biting his brains just threw haejuji colors 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.810
 I was desperate. 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 Until then, it was only when I was drumming. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:31.829
 Then, when for example, but any other time that would eat seven and less effective 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.360
 So what do you do with the guitar like this 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:43.379
 It's a play, but it 's never gonna happen this way 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.400
 I can not play it. So from that moment on , this symptom is a little more 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.739
 Started spreading 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:54.300
 Then I missed the typhoon now , so maybe even when I lock the button 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.100
 Django is a little long, but a little consciousness doeseo What is it these little mwogo 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.550
 Everything that comes to you when

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.360
 I saw everything you've seen on haebwatneunde Care Hospital 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.229
 Sometimes it's a symptom, but it's often played by a player 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.229
 Symptoms, but no cure or root cause is known 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:26.520

 There are so many , but oddly enough, this symptom would have a bad effect on me 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 I have never been there before. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.770
 Because I hit the drum and it was the lighter I set up, not the guy or the performer. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.750
 It took the direction to have a regular squad went to the army general coffee aroma month with a shovel 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.539
