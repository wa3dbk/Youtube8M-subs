00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.080 

okay<00:00:01.949> so<00:00:02.010> in<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.520> we're<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> be

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay so in this video we're going to be

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.780 
okay so in this video we're going to be
talking<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.510> prime<00:00:04.080> factors<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.220> in<00:00:05.700> a

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
talking about prime factors and in a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.579 
talking about prime factors and in a
fairly<00:00:06.060> typical<00:00:06.299> exam<00:00:06.930> question<00:00:07.410> there'll<00:00:07.560> be

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
fairly typical exam question there'll be

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.879 
fairly typical exam question there'll be
something<00:00:07.950> little<00:00:08.370> eyes<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:09.050> express<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
something little eyes on express the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.599 
something little eyes on express the
number<00:00:12.410> 108<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.490> product<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.480> its<00:00:15.839> prime

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
number 108 as a product of its prime

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.400 
number 108 as a product of its prime
factors<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.600> two<00:00:18.779> things<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> need<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
factors and the two things you need to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.740 
factors and the two things you need to
know<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.010> moving<00:00:20.220> by<00:00:20.460> factors<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.600> what

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
know it's all moving by factors and what

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.509 
know it's all moving by factors and what
we<00:00:21.869> didn't<00:00:22.170> mean<00:00:22.439> by<00:00:22.619> prime

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
we didn't mean by prime

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.740 
we didn't mean by prime
okay<00:00:24.000> well<00:00:24.210> factors<00:00:25.880> are<00:00:26.880> all<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.539> numbers

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
okay well factors are all the numbers

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
okay well factors are all the numbers
that<00:00:28.230> will<00:00:28.380> divide<00:00:28.439> into<00:00:29.369> 108<00:00:30.300> neatly<00:00:31.289> without

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that will divide into 108 neatly without

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.200 
that will divide into 108 neatly without
leaving<00:00:32.340> anything

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
leaving anything

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.729 
leaving anything
so<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> typical<00:00:33.930> factor<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.920> 108<00:00:35.489> would<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:36.000> say

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
so a typical factor of 108 would be say

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.850 
so a typical factor of 108 would be say
2<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:39.710> 5th<00:00:40.710> before<00:00:41.750> because<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.110> divide<00:00:43.440> 2

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
2 or 5th before because I can divide 2

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.080 
2 or 5th before because I can divide 2
into<00:00:44.070> 108<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.570> by<00:00:45.719> 54<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.530> 208<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.879> that's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
into 108 I can do by 54 in 208 so that's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.010 
into 108 I can do by 54 in 208 so that's
what<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.420> mean<00:00:48.600> by<00:00:48.950> factors<00:00:49.969> by<00:00:50.969> prime<00:00:51.570> numbers

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
what we mean by factors by prime numbers

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.939 
what we mean by factors by prime numbers
of<00:00:52.949> prime<00:00:53.370> factors<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.360> prime<00:00:55.199> number<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
of prime factors a prime number is a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.700 
of prime factors a prime number is a
number<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.910> only<00:00:57.239> divisible<00:00:57.809> by<00:00:58.079> itself

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
number that is only divisible by itself

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.570 
number that is only divisible by itself
on<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.449> -<00:01:01.340> it's<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:03.019> okay<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.920> if

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
on one so - it's one of them okay so if

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.880 
on one so - it's one of them okay so if
you're<00:01:05.850> asked<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> express<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.409> hundred<00:01:07.740> eight

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you're asked to express a hundred eight

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.300 
you're asked to express a hundred eight
as<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> province<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.850> its<00:01:09.000> prime<00:01:09.390> factors

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
as a province in its prime factors

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
as a province in its prime factors
generally<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.119> use

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
generally the way that we do is just use

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.530 
generally the way that we do is just use
something<00:01:12.810> called<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> factor<00:01:13.860> tree<00:01:14.540> where

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
something called a factor tree where

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.929 
something called a factor tree where
basically<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.979> express<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.939> number<00:01:18.479> as

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
basically we express that number as

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.219 
basically we express that number as
multiplications<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.630> down<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
multiplications all the way down a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.980 
multiplications all the way down a
little<00:01:22.830> diagram<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.729> tree<00:01:23.970> diagram<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.869> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
little diagram little tree diagram so we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
little diagram little tree diagram so we
start<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.380> hundred<00:01:25.710> eight<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> top<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
start with hundred eight at the top and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.310 
start with hundred eight at the top and
what<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> use

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
those<00:01:28.530> two<00:01:28.799> numbers<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
those two numbers there and I'm going to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
those two numbers there and I'm going to
say<00:01:30.240> hundred<00:01:31.140> eight<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.560> exactly<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:32.700> as

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
say hundred eight is exactly the same as

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
say hundred eight is exactly the same as
two<00:01:33.270> times<00:01:34.229> 54<00:01:35.299> as<00:01:36.299> we've<00:01:36.540> already<00:01:36.720> said<00:01:37.140> two

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
two times 54 as we've already said two

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.840 
two times 54 as we've already said two
is<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.790> prime<00:01:39.119> factor<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
is a prime factor so what we can do is I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.630 
is a prime factor so what we can do is I
can<00:01:41.909> circle<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.290> say<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.369> no

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
can circle that to say that there is no

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.389 
can circle that to say that there is no
other<00:01:44.939> number<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.560> apart

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
other number that will go into two apart

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.139 
other number that will go into two apart
from<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.350> itself<00:01:49.460> however<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.759> case<00:01:50.909> is

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
from one and itself however the case is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.870 
from one and itself however the case is
about<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.540> true<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> number<00:01:52.439> 54<00:01:52.979> because

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
about not true for the number 54 because

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.770 
about not true for the number 54 because
with<00:01:54.119> 54<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.200> could<00:01:55.829> say<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.119> six<00:01:57.509> times

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
with 54 I could say that that six times

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.179 
with 54 I could say that that six times
9<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.860> 54<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.299> prime<00:02:00.930> number<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> prime

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
9 so 54 is not a prime number or a prime

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.840 
9 so 54 is not a prime number or a prime
factor<00:02:02.990> Laura<00:02:03.990> six<00:02:04.439> nor<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.130> nine<00:02:05.369> because

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
factor Laura six nor is nine because

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.180 
factor Laura six nor is nine because
with<00:02:06.299> six<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.129> can<00:02:08.129> multiply<00:02:08.700> two<00:02:09.709> times<00:02:10.709> three

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
with six I can multiply two times three

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.930 
with six I can multiply two times three
and<00:02:11.400> both

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and both

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.810 
and both
those<00:02:12.210> are<00:02:12.780> prime<00:02:13.440> numbers<00:02:13.980> numbers<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.700> are

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
those are prime numbers numbers that are

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.140 
those are prime numbers numbers that are
only<00:02:14.940> divisible<00:02:15.090> by<00:02:15.510> themselves<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.620> one

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
only divisible by themselves and one

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.140 
only divisible by themselves and one
night<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.710> multiplied<00:02:20.310> as<00:02:20.610> three<00:02:21.860> times

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
night can be multiplied as three times

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.440 
night can be multiplied as three times
three<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.960> I'm<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> situation<00:02:25.440> now<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.450> for

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
three so I'm in a situation now that for

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.180 
three so I'm in a situation now that for
the<00:02:27.900> number<00:02:28.200> 108<00:02:28.740> I've<00:02:29.220> worked<00:02:29.910> out<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.840> 2<00:02:31.290> 2

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the number 108 I've worked out that 2 2

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.810 
the number 108 I've worked out that 2 2
3<00:02:32.880> 3<00:02:33.270> &amp;<00:02:34.080> 3<00:02:34.520> are<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.300> prime<00:02:36.660> factors<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:37.820> 108

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
3 3 &amp; 3 are all the prime factors of 108

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.320 
3 3 &amp; 3 are all the prime factors of 108
so<00:02:39.810> where<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> question<00:02:40.410> says<00:02:40.620> Express<00:02:41.520> huh

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
so where the question says Express huh

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.470 
so where the question says Express huh
grenades<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.410> function<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.250> prime<00:02:44.670> factors

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
grenades as a function is prime factors

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.840 
grenades as a function is prime factors
what<00:02:45.810> they<00:02:46.020> mean<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:47.100> want<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.640> write

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
what they mean is they want you to write

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.230 
what they mean is they want you to write
a<00:02:48.120> hundred<00:02:48.330> 8<00:02:48.750> equals<00:02:49.590> 2<00:02:51.110> times<00:02:52.110> 2<00:02:52.530> times<00:02:53.240> 3

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
a hundred 8 equals 2 times 2 times 3

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.770 
a hundred 8 equals 2 times 2 times 3
times<00:02:55.700> 3<00:02:56.700> times<00:02:57.500> 3<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.010> that's<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.480> answer<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
times 3 times 3 and that's the answer to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.580 
times 3 times 3 and that's the answer to
the<00:03:00.900> question

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the question

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.270 
the question
so<00:03:02.390> let's<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.690> they<00:03:03.960> will<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:04.650> very<00:03:04.860> briefly

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
so let's say they will just very briefly

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.250 
so let's say they will just very briefly
do<00:03:05.520> another<00:03:05.760> quick<00:03:06.030> question<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.780> let's<00:03:06.960> say

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
do another quick question so let's say

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.980 
do another quick question so let's say
the<00:03:07.800> number<00:03:08.130> 24<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.240> I'm<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.840> do

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
the number 24 and I'm just going to do

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.550 
the number 24 and I'm just going to do
it<00:03:10.080> at<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> side<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.940> 24<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> factor<00:03:13.320> tree

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
it at the side here 24 as a factor tree

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.020 
it at the side here 24 as a factor tree
would<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.430> say<00:03:14.850> 2<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.810> 12<00:03:16.489> we<00:03:17.489> know<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.820> twos

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
would be say 2 and 12 we know that twos

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.090 
would be say 2 and 12 we know that twos
okay<00:03:18.600> 12<00:03:19.020> isn't<00:03:19.940> 12<00:03:20.940> however<00:03:21.239> could<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.959> say<00:03:22.560> 3

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
okay 12 isn't 12 however could be say 3

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.040 
okay 12 isn't 12 however could be say 3
&amp;<00:03:23.489> 4<00:03:24.440> 3<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.620> okay<00:03:25.980> four<00:03:26.790> isn't<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.660> could<00:03:27.900> also

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
&amp; 4 3 so okay four isn't it could also

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.120 
&amp; 4 3 so okay four isn't it could also
be<00:03:28.260> 2<00:03:28.620> &amp;<00:03:28.830> 6<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.459> wanted<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.770> with<00:03:31.770> 4

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
be 2 &amp; 6 if you wanted it because with 4

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.410 
be 2 &amp; 6 if you wanted it because with 4
I<00:03:32.580> could<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.300> 2<00:03:33.780> times<00:03:34.590> 2<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.209> think

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
I could have 2 times 2 and if you think

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.690 
I could have 2 times 2 and if you think
about<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.260> if<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:38.070> have<00:03:38.220> done<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.550> is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
about it that's if I have done that is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.850 
about it that's if I have done that is
12<00:03:39.239> &amp;<00:03:40.070> 2<00:03:41.070> &amp;<00:03:41.489> 6<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.630> still<00:03:43.050> would<00:03:43.320> have<00:03:43.410> ended<00:03:43.650> up

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
12 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 I still would have ended up

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.310 
12 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 I still would have ended up
with<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.610> same<00:03:46.250> factors<00:03:48.320> 3<00:03:49.320> 2<00:03:49.920> &amp;<00:03:50.250> 2<00:03:50.430> 3<00:03:51.000> 2<00:03:51.420> &amp;<00:03:51.720> 2<00:03:51.930> so

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
with the same factors 3 2 &amp; 2 3 2 &amp; 2 so

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.140 
with the same factors 3 2 &amp; 2 3 2 &amp; 2 so
doesn't<00:03:52.500> matter<00:03:52.709> really<00:03:53.040> which<00:03:53.519> way<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.820> work

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
doesn't matter really which way you work

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.600 
doesn't matter really which way you work
it<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.690> I'm<00:03:55.140> gonna<00:03:55.380> confuse<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.980> at<00:03:56.070> all<00:03:56.280> but

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
it and I'm gonna confuse you at all but

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.090 
it and I'm gonna confuse you at all but
as<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.360> put<00:03:57.630> through<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.290> different<00:03:58.709> numbers

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
as you put through the different numbers

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.410 
as you put through the different numbers
you<00:03:59.130> will<00:03:59.489> at<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> end<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.090> it

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
you will at the end of it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.600 
you will at the end of it
come<00:04:00.750> out<00:04:00.930> with<00:04:01.140> all<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.530> prime<00:04:01.800> factors<00:04:02.400> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
come out with all the prime factors of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.930 
come out with all the prime factors of
the<00:04:03.090> number<00:04:03.360> 24<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.290> another<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.250> grenades<00:04:05.670> or

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the number 24 of another and grenades or

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.880 
the number 24 of another and grenades or
any<00:04:06.330> other<00:04:06.600> number<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.080> choose<00:04:07.320> hope

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
any other number that you choose hope

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.320 
any other number that you choose hope
that's<00:04:08.100> okay<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:08.970> that's<00:04:09.120> prime

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
that's okay for you and that's prime

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.240 
that's okay for you and that's prime
factors<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.260> look<00:04:10.410> at<00:04:10.560> one<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:11.010> next

videos that's going to tell you how we
use<00:04:13.560> those<00:04:13.830> prime<00:04:14.160> factors<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.209> work<00:04:15.390> out

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
use those prime factors to work out
