themselves<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> past<00:01:07.320> said<00:01:07.710> hey<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
themselves in the past said hey it's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
themselves in the past said hey it's
gonna<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.700> tough<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.689> apparently

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
gonna be tough to do this but apparently

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
gonna be tough to do this but apparently
they<00:01:10.770> found<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.189> way<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.670> mean<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> seems<00:01:12.600> like

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
they found a way I mean it seems like

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
they found a way I mean it seems like
it's<00:01:12.960> gonna<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> per<00:01:14.100> game<00:01:14.130> basis<00:01:15.000> where

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it's gonna be on a per game basis where

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's gonna be on a per game basis where
they're<00:01:15.420> gonna<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.920> know

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
they're gonna have to kind of you know

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.280 
they're gonna have to kind of you know
rework<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> emulator<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.600> every<00:01:18.990> game

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
rework the emulator with every game

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.570 
rework the emulator with every game
title<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.040> why<00:01:20.159> they're<00:01:20.310> gonna<00:01:20.400> be

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
title so that's why they're gonna be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.690 
title so that's why they're gonna be
adding<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.830> crap<00:01:22.830> ton<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> games<00:01:23.340> every

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
adding like a crap ton of games every

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
adding like a crap ton of games every
month<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.240> guess<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.110> software

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
month because I guess the software

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
month because I guess the software
engineers<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.340> actually<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
engineers have to actually make the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
engineers have to actually make the
emulator<00:01:27.740> specific<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> each<00:01:29.009> game<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.729> they

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
emulator specific to each game like they

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
emulator specific to each game like they
can't<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> blanket<00:01:31.590> emulator<00:01:32.040> like

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
can't just make a blanket emulator like

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
can't just make a blanket emulator like
you<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.850> PC<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.659> the

you would get for the PC for like the
