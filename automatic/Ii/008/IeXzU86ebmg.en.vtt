the<00:01:23.890> low<00:01:24.040> E<00:01:24.250> string<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.880> don't<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:25.210> to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the low E string so you don't have to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.120 
the low E string so you don't have to
bar<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.350> then<00:01:26.440> with<00:01:26.590> my<00:01:26.680> pinkie<00:01:27.040> I'm

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
going to reach here on the 4th string

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.800 
going to reach here on the 4th string
7th<00:01:29.350> fret<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:29.800> my<00:01:30.610> middle<00:01:30.880> finger<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.570> going

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
7th fret and my middle finger is going

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.440 
7th fret and my middle finger is going
to<00:01:31.840> play<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.830> 2nd<00:01:33.430> string<00:01:33.670> 5th<00:01:34.000> fret<00:01:34.090> and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
to play the 2nd string 5th fret and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.290 
to play the 2nd string 5th fret and
that's<00:01:34.960> your<00:01:35.110> chord

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
that's your chord

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.670 
that's your chord
that<00:01:38.300> cord<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:38.600> movable<00:01:39.020> because<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:39.530> made

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
that cord is movable because it's made

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.590 
that cord is movable because it's made
of<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:39.860> bar<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.280> it's<00:01:40.730> going<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:40.910> replace<00:01:41.210> like

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
of a bar and it's going to replace like

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.680 
of a bar and it's going to replace like
I<00:01:41.720> said<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.170> major<00:01:42.380> seventh<00:01:42.890> chord<00:01:43.040> but<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.540> need

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
I said a major seventh chord but we need

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.530 
I said a major seventh chord but we need
to<00:01:44.780> know<00:01:44.930> which<00:01:45.200> major<00:01:46.040> seventh<00:01:46.460> chord<00:01:46.540> let's

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
to know which major seventh chord let's

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.270 
to know which major seventh chord let's
consider<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.960> root<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.380> low<00:01:48.590> E<00:01:48.770> string<00:01:48.800> a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
consider a root on the low E string a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.820 
consider a root on the low E string a
for<00:01:49.760> example<00:01:50.240> if<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.720> is<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.140> root<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:51.770> your

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
for example if a is the root of your

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.660 
for example if a is the root of your
major<00:01:52.190> 7th<00:01:52.670> chord<00:01:52.910> you're<00:01:53.060> trying<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.420> replace

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
major 7th chord you're trying to replace

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.010 
major 7th chord you're trying to replace
you're<00:01:55.670> going<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.850> start<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.330> new<00:01:56.660> chord

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
you're going to start that new chord

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.890 
you're going to start that new chord
from<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.650> major<00:01:57.860> third<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.610> root<00:01:59.150> so<00:01:59.810> in

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
from the major third of that root so in

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.719 
from the major third of that root so in
this<00:01:59.990> case<00:02:00.260> if<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.619> low<00:02:00.770> E<00:02:00.950> string<00:02:00.979> fifth<00:02:01.640> fret

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
this case if the low E string fifth fret

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.670 
this case if the low E string fifth fret
is<00:02:02.030> our<00:02:02.180> roots<00:02:02.450> we're<00:02:03.080> going<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.290> go<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.440> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
is our roots we're going to go to the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.190 
is our roots we're going to go to the
next<00:02:04.130> string<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.760> fifth<00:02:04.940> string<00:02:05.540> 1<00:02:06.170> fret

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
next string the fifth string 1 fret

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.639 
next string the fifth string 1 fret
below<00:02:06.530> 4th<00:02:07.070> fret<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.580> start<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.030> record

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
below 4th fret and you start to record

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.800 
below 4th fret and you start to record
and<00:02:09.739> that's<00:02:10.399> how<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.789> cord<00:02:11.060> works<00:02:11.299> so<00:02:11.569> for

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
and that's how that cord works so for

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.080 
and that's how that cord works so for
example<00:02:12.290> if<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.860> am<00:02:12.920> trying<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.310> replace<00:02:13.579> a<00:02:13.640> D

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
example if I am trying to replace a D

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.199 
example if I am trying to replace a D
major<00:02:14.780> seventh<00:02:15.409> which<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.519> have<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> D<00:02:16.939> on<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
major seventh which we have a D on the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.899 
major seventh which we have a D on the
low<00:02:17.329> E<00:02:17.360> string<00:02:17.540> tenth<00:02:18.079> fret<00:02:18.579> move<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.819> the

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
low E string tenth fret move it to the

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.910 
low E string tenth fret move it to the
next<00:02:20.150> string<00:02:20.420> 1<00:02:20.629> fret<00:02:20.659> below<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.439> that's<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
next string 1 fret below and that's the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.020 
next string 1 fret below and that's the
starting<00:02:22.189> point<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.579> my<00:02:22.640> new<00:02:22.849> chord

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
starting point of my new chord

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
starting point of my new chord
so<00:02:25.600> we're<00:02:25.720> going<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.930> replace<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.260> major

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
so we're going to replace a major

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.940 
so we're going to replace a major
seventh<00:02:27.160> chord<00:02:27.250> with<00:02:27.820> that<00:02:28.060> inversion<00:02:28.950> let's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
seventh chord with that inversion let's

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.170 
seventh chord with that inversion let's
for<00:02:30.220> example<00:02:30.250> take<00:02:31.380> one<00:02:32.380> two<00:02:32.830> three<00:02:33.340> four<00:02:33.880> and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
for example take one two three four and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.790 
for example take one two three four and
E<00:02:35.020> major<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:36.010> will<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.430> major<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:38.320> one<00:02:38.560> can

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
E major that will be a major the one can

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.230 
E major that will be a major the one can
be<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.130> major<00:02:39.430> seventh

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
be a major seventh

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.470 
be a major seventh
and<00:02:41.330> then<00:02:41.900> I'll<00:02:42.050> have<00:02:42.230> F<00:02:42.500> sharp<00:02:42.860> minor<00:02:43.040> seven<00:02:43.520> G

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
and then I'll have F sharp minor seven G

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.240 
and then I'll have F sharp minor seven G
sharp<00:02:44.690> minor<00:02:44.840> 7<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:46.790> major<00:02:47.240> 7<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.100> can

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
sharp minor 7 and a major 7 so I can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.910 
sharp minor 7 and a major 7 so I can
replace<00:02:49.640> these<00:02:49.790> two<00:02:49.850> major<00:02:50.270> 7th<00:02:50.750> chords<00:02:51.290> with

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
replace these two major 7th chords with

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.690 
replace these two major 7th chords with
the<00:02:52.220> inversion<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.150> e<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:55.040> replace<00:02:55.370> with<00:02:55.670> a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the inversion the e I can replace with a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.720 
the inversion the e I can replace with a
new<00:02:56.090> chord<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> for<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.320> I've<00:02:57.620> got<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:58.310> knee

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
new chord and for that I've got a knee

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.030 
new chord and for that I've got a knee
