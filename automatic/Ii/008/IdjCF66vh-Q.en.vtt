much more effective in circle jerks the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
much more effective in circle jerks the
reason<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.660> say<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.550> foreskins

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
reason I say that is because foreskins

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.729
