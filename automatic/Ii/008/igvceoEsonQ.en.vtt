00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.960
 hello to all guys back on mine 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.600
 Chamber of Commerce also to say that with one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 player review the player and me of a team 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 mobile season 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.390
 let's talk about marchisio fear a season 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.059
 player who has earned this card 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
 after the great performance 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.449
 realized this year with his 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.580
 juventus and it's not over yet because 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.150
 still missing the final of champions 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.309
 league 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.949
 but let's see this card immediately 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.350
 looks with 88 rating feels 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.199
 very much the difference from his 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.949
 version not baked from its version 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.839
 normal 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.449
 but let's go immediately to see his 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.790
 statistics we start from speed to 84 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.979
 of speeds that become 84 of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.530
 acceleration 84 of snap speed 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 marchisio is a fast player you can 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.830
 say that marquis a fast player 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.400
 anyway to be a midfielder 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.320
 a great speed he 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960
 can safely take the ball e 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.400
 can overcome opponents precisely in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.920
 speed 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.260
 if he succeeds in having a free field 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.119
 if you can go safely but the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.430
 great thing about this player his 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.950
 great ball control precisely that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.689
 allows him to keep the ball always 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.899
 near the four-star feet 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.600
 88 chance of dribbling king in 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.090
 they become therefore very agile 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.549
 great agility for marchisio yes 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 really feels so great 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.219
 balance on contrasts always remains 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.829
 standing then 82 I say of balance 89 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.469
 of reflexes 89 of control ball 86 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.270
 disagreement in pure as I said with 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.780
 you really can do that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.509
 what you want 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.170
 throws 81 the throws in game become 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.380
 86 finalizing placement 78 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.990
 79 power shot 83 of long shot 85 of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.780
 throws on the fly and 79 penalty throws in 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.580
 media tenderly to a midfielder 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.490
 appearance of the large outside the area 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.270
 when not finding an appearance that ends 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.190
 so let's say a 60 percent that a 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.600
 times the mind in and a 40 percent 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.380
 that happens that does not put it inside 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.820
 however shots that I liked are not 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.000
 a player who has a great long in him 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.760
 shot type toure but still 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.920
 really guarantee defense we talk 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.190
 also defense 80 defense in game 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.040
 become 85 interceptions 72 of 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.370
 head accuracy 72 marking 83 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.690
 contrasts of slip the defense and me 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.210
 loved the stage 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.520
 excuse me for this player 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.620
 he loved it as a war keita 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.480
 high high so how you will find it in the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.980
 attack you will find it also in defense and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.690
 when you find him in defense he will 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.160
 really its dirty good work 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.990
 interceptions excellent contrasts 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.700
 really always recover the balloons and 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.310
 then to restart the maneuver then 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.360
 great physical great defense sorry for 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.400
 marchisio 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.740
 the steps turn by five steps 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.530
 that becomes 87 visions and 79 of 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.050
 cross 68 precise 80 various provisions 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.690
 short passages 83 long passages and 81 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.250
 of effect large passages both at level 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.920
 of long launches both at cross level 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.850
 both at the level of maybe past that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.080
 trend towards the tips or however one two 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.620
 excellent excellent passages of this 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.350
 player 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.080
 the physical of physicist that in india in 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.630
 they become 79 of elevation 93 of 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.730
 strength 67 of force 88 of 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.860
 aggressiveness aggression is one thing 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.520
 which I liked very much about this 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.990
 player 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.110
 why 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.380
 unity precisely at its greatest stage 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.580
 defensive really is a very big one 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.120
 great balloon recovery this one 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.500
 player 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.360
 so guys going to do a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.970
 summary of the pros and cons of the pros 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.890
 surely we find speed steps 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.690
 great ball control but really 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.670
 one thing that I liked tantisssimo e 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.400
 the defensive phase a player who 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.680
 you can use almost everywhere cd 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.510
 cc cc ac really where you want 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.330
 the only counter I found is 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.160
 precisely the price is the price because 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.720
 really this player up 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.900
 playstation is little more than a 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.690
 million and quality level we say 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.060
 in series we can really find 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.980
 lots of other alternatives that cost 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.440
 same but also stronger 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.810
 I think my opinion is still pogba 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.880
 superior bomb its version is made 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.610
 then waiting for the team of the version 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.310
 season so anyway great player yes 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.740
 pecks a nice 9 as upgrade rating 10 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.480
 because you really feel so much 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.770
 difference between the normal version la 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.660
 team of the season version 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.310
