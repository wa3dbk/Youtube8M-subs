already I went ahead and I've separated

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.260 
already I went ahead and I've separated
the<00:00:46.350> stems<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> leaves<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.880> what<00:00:48.150> I'll

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the stems from the leaves and what I'll

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
the stems from the leaves and what I'll
do<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.960> I'll<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.350> through<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.740> I'll<00:00:49.860> cook<00:00:50.400> them

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
do is I'll go through and I'll cook them

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
do is I'll go through and I'll cook them
up<00:00:50.810> and<00:00:51.810> i'll<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.140> pretty<00:00:52.470> much<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
up and i'll show you pretty much how to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.400 
up and i'll show you pretty much how to
do<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> here's<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> stems<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.230> have

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
do this and here's the stems and i have

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
do this and here's the stems and i have
them<00:00:58.590> separated<00:00:59.310> basically<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
them separated basically because the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.609 
them separated basically because the
stems<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:02.280> only<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
stems actually only need to be cut and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
stems actually only need to be cut and
cooked<00:01:04.619> once<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.549> leaves<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> have

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
cooked once the leaves are going to have

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.630 
cooked once the leaves are going to have
to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.420> cooked<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.930> three<00:01:07.829> to<00:01:07.950> four<00:01:08.130> changes<00:01:08.579> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to be cooked in three to four changes of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
to be cooked in three to four changes of
water<00:01:08.909> i'll<00:01:09.119> probably<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
water i'll probably do for just to be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.249 
water i'll probably do for just to be
safe<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.790> leaves<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.659> high<00:01:12.869> in

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
safe the leaves are actually high in

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.190 
safe the leaves are actually high in
oxacillin<00:01:14.009> acid<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.960> interfere<00:01:16.649> with

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
oxacillin acid which can interfere with

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.969 
oxacillin acid which can interfere with
nutritional<00:01:19.200> absorption<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> your

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
nutritional absorption of your

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.169 
nutritional absorption of your
intestines<00:01:20.749> not<00:01:21.749> a<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:22.020> thing<00:01:22.289> now<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
intestines not a good thing now in a

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.539 
intestines not a good thing now in a
survival<00:01:24.479> situation<00:01:25.130> what<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> would<00:01:26.399> actually

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
survival situation what I would actually

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.599 
survival situation what I would actually
do<00:01:26.999> if<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.240> found<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.929> wild<00:01:28.399> would<00:01:29.399> be

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
do if I found these in the wild would be

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.840 
do if I found these in the wild would be
to<00:01:29.909> cook<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.810> wants<00:01:31.499> and<00:01:31.679> then<00:01:32.280> eat<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to cook these wants and then eat the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510 
to cook these wants and then eat the
stem<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:34.049> central<00:01:34.469> vein<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:35.069> the<00:01:35.219> center

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
stem the central vein from the center

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
stem the central vein from the center
discarding<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:36.270> leaves<00:01:36.539> because<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.139> leaves

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
discarding the leaves because the leaves

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.399 
discarding the leaves because the leaves
is<00:01:37.649> where<00:01:37.889> that<00:01:38.759> actual<00:01:39.209> toxin<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is where that actual toxin is and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.620 
is where that actual toxin is and
cooking<00:01:41.249> in<00:01:41.579> several<00:01:41.969> changes<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.359> water

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
cooking in several changes of water

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
cooking in several changes of water
destroys<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.740> being<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.279> a<00:01:44.399> home

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
destroys this so being in a home

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.599 
destroys this so being in a home
environment<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:47.279> cook<00:01:47.429> these

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
environment you can actually cook these

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.180 
environment you can actually cook these
up<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.179> have<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> pretty<00:01:48.779> good<00:01:48.840> meal

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.340 

okay<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> show<00:01:52.480> you<00:01:52.510> basically<00:01:53.080> all<00:01:53.320> I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
okay just to show you basically all I

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.690 
okay just to show you basically all I
did<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:54.040> I<00:01:54.910> separated<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.750> root<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:57.550> then<00:01:57.640> I

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
did was I separated the root and then I

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.530 
did was I separated the root and then I
found<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:59.070> stems<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.400> wanted<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.790> use<00:02:01.000> and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540

have the green add the stand and from
there<00:02:06.580> they<00:02:06.760> were<00:02:06.820> separated<00:02:07.420> out<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:07.690> put

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
there they were separated out and put

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.410 
there they were separated out and put
into<00:02:07.990> separate<00:02:08.410> bowls<00:02:09.330> okay<00:02:10.330> now<00:02:10.479> like<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.780> said

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.240 
into separate bowls okay now like I said
separate<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.570> root<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.050> all<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.500> want<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.070 
separate the root and all we want is the
stem<00:02:15.520> now<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.180> didn't<00:02:16.420> look<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.840> really

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
stem now it didn't look like I really

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.960 
stem now it didn't look like I really
got<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.470> much<00:02:17.710> from<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.250> spot<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.850> I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
got that much from that one spot and I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.390 
got that much from that one spot and I
dug<00:02:19.180> with<00:02:19.330> my<00:02:19.510> more<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> knife<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:21.010> harvest

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
dug with my more a knife to harvest

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.880 
dug with my more a knife to harvest
these<00:02:21.580> because<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.470> didn't<00:02:23.470> want<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.710> use<00:02:23.860> a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
these because I didn't want to use a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.690 
these because I didn't want to use a
shovel<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.780> injure<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.890> rest<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.310> plants

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
shovel and injure the rest of the plants

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.820 
shovel and injure the rest of the plants
by<00:02:27.910> sending<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.570> into<00:02:28.690> shock<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.050> killing

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
by sending them into shock and killing

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.250 
by sending them into shock and killing
the<00:02:30.550> entire<00:02:30.910> patch<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.480> plants<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.990> was<00:02:32.110> out

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the entire patch of plants that was out

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.980 
the entire patch of plants that was out
there<00:02:32.470> any<00:02:32.800> time<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.160> disturb<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> roots

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
there any time you disturb the roots

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.150 
there any time you disturb the roots
when<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.050> don't<00:02:35.260> intend<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> harvest<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
when you don't intend to harvest the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.920 
when you don't intend to harvest the
entire<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:38.350> entire<00:02:38.380> crop<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:40.600> run<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> risk

entire the entire crop you run the risk

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.600 
entire the entire crop you run the risk
of<00:02:41.940> actually<00:02:42.940> killing<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.050> entire<00:02:44.380> area<00:02:44.610> if

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
of actually killing the entire area if

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.750 
of actually killing the entire area if
you're<00:02:45.880> not<00:02:46.000> careful<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.460> is<00:02:48.580> basically

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
you're not careful so this is basically

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.310 
you're not careful so this is basically
what<00:02:49.330> i<00:02:49.360> did<00:02:49.690> this<00:02:49.990> i<00:02:50.230> will<00:02:50.440> throw<00:02:50.680> away<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:53.020> i

the sediments have been washed away from
in<00:02:59.440> between<00:02:59.470> each<00:02:59.800> stem<00:03:00.420> okay<00:03:01.420> now<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
in between each stem okay now that

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.090 
in between each stem okay now that
everything's<00:03:02.170> been<00:03:02.320> washed<00:03:02.560> out<00:03:02.800> i'm<00:03:02.980> just

everything's been washed out i'm just
going<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.310> add<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.820> little<00:03:03.940> bit<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.690> salt<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.140> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
going to add a little bit of salt to the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.220 
going to add a little bit of salt to the
water<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:05.680> will<00:03:05.860> reduce<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.959> boiling<00:03:07.959> point

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
water this will reduce the boiling point

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.410 
water this will reduce the boiling point
and<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.010> small<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.550> I'll<00:03:12.970> go<00:03:13.180> ahead<00:03:13.300> and

boiled lids on now we're just going to
let<00:03:47.879> them<00:03:47.970> boil<00:03:49.459> now<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.549> water<00:03:50.819> starting<00:03:51.239> to

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
let them boil now the water starting to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.930 
let them boil now the water starting to
heat<00:03:51.510> up<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:52.890> can<00:03:53.040> see<00:03:53.250> how<00:03:53.400> they're<00:03:53.549> starting

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
heat up you can see how they're starting

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.890 
heat up you can see how they're starting
to<00:03:53.970> kind<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.440> condensed<00:03:55.440> down<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.980> size<00:03:56.900> this

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
to kind of condensed down in size this

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.289 
to kind of condensed down in size this
means<00:03:58.170> they're<00:03:58.349> starting<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.799> cook<00:03:59.069> now<00:04:02.299> my

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
means they're starting to cook now my

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.720 
means they're starting to cook now my
stems<00:04:03.690> I'll<00:04:03.989> let<00:04:04.140> them<00:04:04.319> boil<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.890> about<00:04:04.980> 45

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
stems I'll let them boil for about 45

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.520 
stems I'll let them boil for about 45
minutes<00:04:08.209> okay<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.540> stems<00:04:09.870> are<00:04:10.079> done<00:04:10.319> they're

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.599 
is I'll take my colomer I'm going to
take<00:04:15.060> them<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.359> just<00:04:15.510> dump<00:04:15.780> them<00:04:15.900> out<00:04:16.400> okay<00:04:17.400> it

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
take them and just dump them out okay it

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.939 
take them and just dump them out okay it
yielded<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.090> little<00:04:18.329> bit<00:04:18.530> enough<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.650> try

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
yielded a little bit enough to try

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.659 
yielded a little bit enough to try
enough<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.639> have<00:04:20.820> with<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> meal<00:04:22.550> well<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
enough to have with a meal well the

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.189 
enough to have with a meal well the
leaves<00:04:23.910> are<00:04:24.060> ready<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.510> their<00:04:24.600> first<00:04:24.840> change

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
leaves are ready for their first change

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.260 
leaves are ready for their first change
of<00:04:25.350> water<00:04:28.220> I'll<00:04:29.220> do<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:29.520> three<00:04:29.820> more<00:04:30.000> times

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
of water I'll do this three more times

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
done now I went ahead and I cooked up

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.969 
done now I went ahead and I cooked up
some<00:04:35.970> rice<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.419> could<00:04:36.570> throw<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.930> stems<00:04:37.800> on

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
some rice so I could throw the stems on

this<00:04:43.229> stuff<00:04:43.500> here<00:04:44.300> just<00:04:45.440> pretty<00:04:46.440> standard<00:04:46.950> for

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
this stuff here just pretty standard for

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.159 
this stuff here just pretty standard for
what<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.250> add<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.639> rice<00:04:50.539> so<00:04:51.539> let's<00:04:51.690> see<00:04:51.870> how<00:04:51.990> this

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
what I add to rice so let's see how this

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.059 
what I add to rice so let's see how this
turns<00:04:52.229> out

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:16.100 

hmm<00:04:59.949> it's<00:05:00.949> not<00:05:01.069> that

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.439 

exactly<00:05:17.110> pretty<00:05:17.320> enjoyable<00:05:18.210> okay<00:05:19.210> now<00:05:19.389> for

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
exactly pretty enjoyable okay now for

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.060 
exactly pretty enjoyable okay now for
home<00:05:19.949> or<00:05:21.600> in<00:05:22.600> other<00:05:22.960> places<00:05:23.199> with<00:05:23.590> more<00:05:23.800> water

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
home or in other places with more water

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.950 
home or in other places with more water
these<00:05:24.669> would<00:05:24.790> be<00:05:24.880> feasible<00:05:25.090> as<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.540> survival

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
these would be feasible as a survival

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.469 
these would be feasible as a survival
food<00:05:26.550> because<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.699> amount<00:05:27.940> of<00:05:28.000> changes<00:05:28.449> of

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
food because the amount of changes of

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.270 
food because the amount of changes of
water<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.080> takes<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.430> desert<00:05:30.760> I

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
water that it takes in the desert I

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.370 
water that it takes in the desert I
wouldn't<00:05:33.280> advise<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.610> because<00:05:34.540> water<00:05:34.930> is<00:05:35.050> into

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
wouldn't advise it because water is into

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.980 
wouldn't advise it because water is into
shorter<00:05:35.710> supply<00:05:36.120> that's<00:05:37.120> why<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.300> popped<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.870> to

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
shorter supply that's why I popped it to

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:46.830 
shorter supply that's why I popped it to
cook<00:05:38.169> these<00:05:38.290> at<00:05:38.500> home<00:05:43.080> mmm<00:05:45.240> well<00:05:46.240> I<00:05:46.450> hope<00:05:46.690> you
