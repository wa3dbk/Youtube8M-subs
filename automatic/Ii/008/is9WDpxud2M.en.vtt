blog watches my YouTube so I thought

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.049 
blog watches my YouTube so I thought
it'd<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> nice<00:00:32.340> way<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
it'd be kind of nice way to get a to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.180 
it'd be kind of nice way to get a to
content<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.140> getting<00:00:34.829> together<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
content kind of like getting together a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
content kind of like getting together a
bit<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.430> rather<00:00:35.850> than<00:00:36.090> being<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.480> separate<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
bit more rather than being so separate I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
bit more rather than being so separate I
find<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.340> hard<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.850> integrate

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
find it really hard to kind of integrate

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.470 
find it really hard to kind of integrate
