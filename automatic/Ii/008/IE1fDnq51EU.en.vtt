off<00:02:41.900> with<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.140> pulled<00:02:42.350> pork<00:02:42.410> but<00:02:43.030> well<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:45.680> a

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
off with the pulled pork but well I'm a

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.819 
off with the pulled pork but well I'm a
scale<00:02:46.040> one<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.340> 10<00:02:46.519> I'm<00:02:46.609> going<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.880> give<00:02:47.000> us<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.829> 6

I<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:50.480> they<00:02:50.540> could<00:02:50.690> make<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.109> a<00:02:51.170> little<00:02:51.260> bit

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
I think they could make it a little bit

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.729 
I think they could make it a little bit
better

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739
