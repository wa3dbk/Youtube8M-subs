 this Friday we prepare for the end of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 week but it has nothing this is a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.389
 recipe that is to treasure in the drawer 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.280
 there's a secret that like they're going to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.170
 envy so if you're looking at a note 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.650
 what are we going to make a cream of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.780
 chocolate and hazelnut is distant but 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 you know they have some jars is the 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.180
 typical Italian chocolate cream 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 eats concrete is typically eaten with 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 everything has inside some chocolates that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.759
 it's delicious, it 's like, that would like 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.380
 like I told you this one of the dulce de leche here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
 that we tell the toast and that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.080
 makes everything richer good that's what 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 let's do now 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.460
 ideal for filling sweet cakes and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.470
 to make a cookie with pleasant 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 we are going to do in a while but first the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.400
 chocolate cream I hope this 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 package I'm talking about, you're not going to 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.170
 forget is what I'm going to tell you until 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.020
 now as it starts it starts with hazelnuts 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.970
 just as is an imported cream it is very 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 expensive to buy the supermarket 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.559
 the homemade muce so that you get a lot 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.920
 more economical in your house we have 100 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.960
 gr 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.720
 of hazelnuts the hazelnuts that are 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.729
 peeled when the fele bits are 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.610
 there goes the recipe below you walk 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.560
 noticing the on a plate you 100 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 grams of hazelnuts and I sent it to the oven 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.820
 medium / low and medium to leave 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.250
 Toasting little by little , however much 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 after about 15 minutes 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.350
 the drops get out of the oven and the skin to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.659
 be starting to come off they put them 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.880
 center reviewed the fruits and peels 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.799
 in this way the processor 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.039
 I'm going to start processing them for another 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.860
 I'm still here 200 cubic centimeters of 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.110
 milk something to add 30 grams of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.659
 milk powder about one tablespoon 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.130
 and a big media here you will see that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.979
 I add this here 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.049
 this is a gentle temptation but I tell you 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.340
 what temptation and addiction because when 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.200
 the company is eating you can stop 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.750
 look at your life should offer a little 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.729
 of what is state is very rich 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.020
 chocolate cream has sanÃ¡ te la 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.429
 you can eat by spoonfuls like 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.890
 ducts with the dulce de leche to 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.020
 spoonfuls is not well said with we have to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.399
 use fairy musician to eat this 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.769
 chocolate cream of healthy is 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.840
 delicious we had 100 grams of 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.630
 hazelnuts toasted and peeled by another 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.910
 side 200 grams of milk 200 centimeters 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.010
 cubic of milk that mexico a 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.680
 spoonful and a half of milk powder and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.690
 a spoonful of honey approximately 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.090
 what more because you always like the sweet 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 a pinch of good salt this also be 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.019
 a pinch of salt if we're going to put it 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.569
 at this time there to enhance the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.880
 flavors we mix this I have not if 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.250
 it's because we're going to let it boil 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.959
 heat this milk and on the other hand the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.690
 sixth ingredient are six ingredients 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.530
 they are 150 grams of chocolate that I have from 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.540
 retirement 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.670
 I have hazelnuts, candles and toast 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.210
 here we are going to process them, let's try 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.830
 that they are 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.830
 the finest that can 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.730
 there is going to do things the most finite 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.740
 that we could with your processor but not 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.090
 for this hot milk and 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.220
 chocolate will boot into it is 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.990
 adding in the melted chocolate that 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.910
 will happen to this by later when 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.820
 the date you are going to send it to 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.770
 refrigerator then the chocolate goes to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.240
 take a bit of consistency and it's not going to 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.160
 remain as liquid as we will be 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.890
 Now that we are going to do it here, we eat 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.800
 stores a good flight good chocolate 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.990
 healthy birds is a delight that you have to 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.330
 do at home because it really is a 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.900
 pavada and as the Italians said 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.670
 you say future not that and this is what 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.140
 we are doing here when when 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.630
 They said they wanted when they saw a pretty girl 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.000
 what happens when they see something they like 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.220
 this a bonus that this is like the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.380
 sweet he is italian but with chocolate 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.020
 hazelnut boiled milk I'm going to run 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.450
 here so that we do not overturn everything and 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.720
 I'm going to process the chocolate head 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.940
 this wind me look what is this 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.640
 in effect we process hazelnut chocolate 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.010
 missing bait add milk 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.660
 a little bit to continue processing send me 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.330
 the refrigerator and you have your cream on 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.400
 chocolate and hazelnuts ready as was born 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.590
 this one last anecdote that I tell you 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.970
 in the war in the second war it 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.310
 they are running out of chocolate 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.620
 Italians apparently then said 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.660
 how can we spread chocolate 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.970
 that we have had a lot of production of 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.250
 hazelnuts then they said let's mix the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.800
 hazelnuts with chocolate and let's make 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.110
 that more amount like this they invented this 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.040
 cream that is a delight I was left 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.040
 processing 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.110
 so easy with chocolate and with 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.270
 all this milk with honey and milk in 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.330
 powder you send it to the refrigerator and you have 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.370
 your homemade chocolate and hazelnut cream 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.750
 and ready to fill any cake 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.210
 any bonbon and the shareholders that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.200
 search in a little while creek seems to me 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.600
 barbarian is delicious is really is 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.460
 delicious is how is the dulce de leche 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.650
 that in Italy but the same but 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.250
 really delicious let's go to the party 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.760
 salty I propose you a filled bondiola 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.470
 a bondiola of pork completita 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.930
 enterita that we are going to open it and we are going 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.910
 to fill was going to be super delicious 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.980
 I can guarantee it ideal for this 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.230
 ideal weekend for all time 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.950
 ideal for many people because it yields and 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.080
 render 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.340
 notice that we have the bond on the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.400
 allowance and 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.870
 It is open to extending him 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.850
 we can then generate the filling 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.639
 whatever it is in this case it's going to 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.250
 know in a minute we started like that look 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.910
 with a sharp knife cutting in 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.190
 diagonal like this with with cuts throughout 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.260
 you saw as peace as you do when you saw 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.510
 you go to the butcher shop and there is the 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.699
 butcher with the chaira and they decide a 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.710
 kilo of Milanese and grabs the buttock and the 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.650
 cut into long slices is not that 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.960
 They put serruchito that rollito but 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.540
 that time passes the saber and you pass the 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.020
 saber in the same way we are opening 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.050
 so oblique thing to go penetrating 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.240
 in the flesh and generating what is going to be 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.060
 after a containment look 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.180
 It opens very easily when we get to 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.340
 this side and I'll go back to the beginning 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.850
 I return to the same with the front as it is 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.310
 there obliquely in diagonal will generate 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.169
 these slices and you're opening this 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.340
 booklet once we arrived from this 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.250
 side we're going to have to do the proper 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.129
 for the other side so let's go again 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.259
 with the knife to generate 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.919
 cut is long look how it's going 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:30.459
 opening then the meat the idea is 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:33.759
 that you have a good surface like 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:36.039
 to fill in there is a good knife 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.679
 sharpened the biggest you have and the 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.659
 You are opening, I put it back together to 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:43.089
 Explain again that simple 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:45.610
 Bondiola was so she is dead 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:49.169
 there and what we did with the knife is 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.839
 open and then for the other side open 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:55.360
 it became very clear it is very easy this 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.759
 now we close it meanwhile 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.729
 we leave there and go with the filling by 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.830
 one side I have here and warm keeps 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.869
 much different than we were cooking at 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.119
 the grill while you take is not 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:09.999
 slowly and advise this recipe because 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:12.309
 It's great to write it down in your notebook 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.689
 has the cover says chefs 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:16.029
 Argentines 2011 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:18.550
 good that requested we are going to itch 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:23.099
 common chorizo ââthat we are going to peck 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.099
 about this size
