make verses videos and this one is by

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.370 
make verses videos and this one is by
far<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.750> most<00:00:07.140> asked<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:08.189> video<00:00:08.670> by<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> lot<00:00:09.809> so

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
far the most asked for video by a lot so

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.720 
far the most asked for video by a lot so
this<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> stg44<00:00:11.790> relic<00:00:12.420> versus<00:00:12.929> the

weapons<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.410> being<00:00:19.680> ridiculously<00:00:20.340> good

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
weapons for just being ridiculously good

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.269 
weapons for just being ridiculously good
with<00:00:21.539> high<00:00:21.720> recoil<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.920> literally

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
with high recoil that is with literally

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.650 
with high recoil that is with literally
the<00:00:23.460> slim<00:00:23.640> Alera<00:00:23.910> T's<00:00:24.060> between<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:24.510> two

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the slim Alera T's between these two

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.089 
the slim Alera T's between these two
weapons<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.680> look<00:00:25.769> at<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
weapons and we really look at it and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
weapons and we really look at it and
figure<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.029> better<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> let

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
figure out which one is better and let

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.599 
figure out which one is better and let
me<00:00:27.689> tell<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.320> bit<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.070> spoiler<00:00:29.429> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
me tell you a little bit of a spoiler it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.350 
me tell you a little bit of a spoiler it
is<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:31.410> close<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:32.189> probably<00:00:33.120> one

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
is really really close like probably one

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.910 
is really really close like probably one
of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> closest<00:00:33.899> matches<00:00:34.290> we've<00:00:34.440> had<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.890> far

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of the closest matches we've had so far

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.119 
of the closest matches we've had so far
so<00:00:35.750> let's<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> here<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:38.040> gonna

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so let's get into it here so we're gonna

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.580 
so let's get into it here so we're gonna
start<00:00:38.399> off<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.579> damage<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> stg44<00:00:40.140> relic

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
start off with damage so the stg44 relic

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
start off with damage so the stg44 relic
has<00:00:40.739> 40<00:00:41.340> damage<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.790> close<00:00:41.820> 33<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.750> mid-range

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
has 40 damage up close 33 at mid-range

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.250 
has 40 damage up close 33 at mid-range
and<00:00:43.379> 24<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.430> long<00:00:44.789> range<00:00:45.180> whereas<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and 24 at long range whereas the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.670 
and 24 at long range whereas the
insanity<00:00:46.920> has<00:00:47.219> 40<00:00:47.850> damage<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.270> close<00:00:48.559> 33<00:00:49.559> at

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
insanity has 40 damage up close 33 at

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.490 
insanity has 40 damage up close 33 at
mid-range<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.329> 25<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.510> long<00:00:51.719> range<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.260> boom

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
mid-range and 25 at long range so boom

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.240 
mid-range and 25 at long range so boom
at<00:00:53.100> long<00:00:53.820> range<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.809> insanity<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.920> one

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
at long range the the insanity is one

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
at long range the the insanity is one
bullet<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> kill<00:00:56.879> better<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.539> means<00:00:57.780> that's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
bullet to kill better which means that's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
bullet to kill better which means that's
plus<00:00:58.320> 10<00:00:58.530> points<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> insanity<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
plus 10 points for the insanity so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.889 
plus 10 points for the insanity so
that's<00:00:59.820> pretty<00:01:00.030> good<00:01:00.180> start<00:01:00.449> off<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's pretty good start off for the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.090 
that's pretty good start off for the
insanity<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> next<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.739> we're<00:01:01.829> gonna<00:01:01.890> look

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
insanity the next thing we're gonna look

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
insanity the next thing we're gonna look
at<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.180> fire<00:01:03.480> rate<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> fire

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
at here is the fire rate so the fire

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.570 
at here is the fire rate so the fire
rate<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.799> hard<00:01:04.979> thing<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.339> compare

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
rate is a really hard thing to compare

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.039 
rate is a really hard thing to compare
on<00:01:05.700> these<00:01:05.850> two<00:01:06.000> weapons<00:01:06.119> because<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.840> look

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on these two weapons because if we look

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.700 
on these two weapons because if we look
at<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> stg44<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.729> has<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.260> 857<00:01:10.260> fire<00:01:10.500> rate

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
at the stg44 it has an 857 fire rate

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
at the stg44 it has an 857 fire rate
just<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> fire<00:01:11.760> rate<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
just that is the fire rate that is that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.039 
just that is the fire rate that is that
whereas<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> insanity<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> 1,000<00:01:15.840> fire

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
whereas the insanity has a 1,000 fire

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
whereas the insanity has a 1,000 fire
rate<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> first<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.040> believe<00:01:17.310> four

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
rate for the first I believe four

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149 
rate for the first I believe four
bullets<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.750> after<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.290> Gramps<00:01:19.920> down

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bullets and then after that Gramps down

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.170 
bullets and then after that Gramps down
to<00:01:20.479> 750<00:01:21.479> fire<00:01:21.720> rate<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.470> overall<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.909> fire

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to 750 fire rate so overall the fire

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
to 750 fire rate so overall the fire
rate<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> relic<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.080> better<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
rate for the relic is better but the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
rate for the relic is better but the
starting<00:01:26.729> fire<00:01:26.939> rate<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> insanity<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
starting fire rate for the insanity is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
starting fire rate for the insanity is
better<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.979> gonna<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> give<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
better but I'm gonna have to give the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
better but I'm gonna have to give the
+10<00:01:30.630> points<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> relic<00:01:31.890> simply<00:01:32.369> because

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
+10 points to the relic simply because

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
+10 points to the relic simply because
it's<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:33.990> reliable<00:01:34.320> every<00:01:34.860> time<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.189> press

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
it's more reliable every time you press

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's more reliable every time you press
that<00:01:35.579> trigger<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.479> exact<00:01:36.900> fire

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that trigger you know the exact fire

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
that trigger you know the exact fire
rate<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> fire<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.159> whereas<00:01:38.460> for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
rate it's going to fire at whereas for

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
rate it's going to fire at whereas for
the<00:01:38.729> insanity<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.930> start<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the insanity it's gonna start at that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
the insanity it's gonna start at that
but<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> ramps<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.180> not

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
but then it ramps down and it's just not

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.749 
but then it ramps down and it's just not
quite<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.049> reliable<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.280> still<00:01:44.520> very

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
quite as reliable but it's still very

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
quite as reliable but it's still very
very<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.329> those<00:01:45.420> first<00:01:45.600> two<00:01:45.869> bullets<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
very good for those first two bullets to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
very good for those first two bullets to
have<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.460> faster<00:01:47.820> fire<00:01:48.000> rate<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> it'll

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
have that faster fire rate and it'll

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
have that faster fire rate and it'll
come<00:01:48.869> back<00:01:49.079> full<00:01:49.439> circle<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.189> later<00:01:50.460> in

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
come back full circle to that later in

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.460 
come back full circle to that later in
this<00:01:50.820> video<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.240> you'll<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.720> plus<00:01:52.259> 10

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
this video as you'll see so plus 10

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.770 
this video as you'll see so plus 10
points<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> relic<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.479> next

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
points for the relic for that the next

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.910 
points for the relic for that the next
thing<00:01:54.869> we're<00:01:54.990> gonna<00:01:55.110> look<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.530> range

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
thing we're gonna look at is the range

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
thing we're gonna look at is the range
and<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> range<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:57.000> really

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and the range is actually really

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.490 
and the range is actually really
important<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.840> comparing<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.320> two

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
important when comparing these two

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
important when comparing these two
weapons<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.430> their<00:01:59.729> damages<00:02:00.329> are<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
weapons because their damages are so so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.219 
weapons because their damages are so so
similar<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.460> range<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> stg44<00:02:03.840> relic

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
similar so the range for the stg44 relic

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.660 
similar so the range for the stg44 relic
is<00:02:04.350> 650<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.520> short<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.909> mid-range<00:02:07.310> 1500<00:02:08.310> from

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
is 650 from short to mid-range 1500 from

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.540 
is 650 from short to mid-range 1500 from
mid<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.209> long<00:02:09.420> range<00:02:09.560> whereas<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.830> insanity

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
mid to long range whereas the insanity

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.460 
mid to long range whereas the insanity
has<00:02:12.300> 800<00:02:12.750> nine

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
has 800 nine

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
has 800 nine
six<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:14.130> short<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.520> mid-range<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.360> that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
six from short to mid-range and one that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.590 
six from short to mid-range and one that
uh<00:02:16.280> 1700<00:02:17.280> from<00:02:17.520> mid<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.820> long<00:02:18.000> range<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.420> both

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
uh 1700 from mid to long range so both

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.330 
uh 1700 from mid to long range so both
of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.900> ranges<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.470> better<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
of the ranges are better for the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.990 
of the ranges are better for the
insanity

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
insanity

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240 
insanity
so<00:02:21.300> plus<00:02:21.570> ten<00:02:21.810> points<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.350> insanity<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so plus ten points for the insanity the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.740 
so plus ten points for the insanity the
next<00:02:23.460> few<00:02:23.640> things<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.060> look<00:02:24.180> at<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.540> all

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
next few things we can look at are all

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.750 
next few things we can look at are all
very<00:02:25.230> similar<00:02:25.710> between<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.130> guns<00:02:26.550> for

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
very similar between the guns for

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.970 
very similar between the guns for
example<00:02:27.120> aim<00:02:27.510> down<00:02:27.780> sights<00:02:28.080> time<00:02:28.290> 250

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
example aim down sights time 250

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.920 
example aim down sights time 250
milliseconds<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.640> both<00:02:29.790> guns<00:02:30.090> another<00:02:30.780> thing

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
milliseconds for both guns another thing

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
milliseconds for both guns another thing
we<00:02:30.990> can<00:02:31.080> look<00:02:31.170> at<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.440> magazine<00:02:32.340> size<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.760> 30

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
we can look at is magazine size so 30

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.730 
we can look at is magazine size so 30
for<00:02:33.330> both<00:02:33.480> guns<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.990> both<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.320> them<00:02:34.440> start

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
for both guns and both of them start

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.310 
for both guns and both of them start
with<00:02:34.890> 120<00:02:35.490> bullets<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.480> next<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.290> are

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
with 120 bullets the next thing we are

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.440 
with 120 bullets the next thing we are
going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.740> look<00:02:38.040> at<00:02:38.220> here<00:02:38.400> though<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.790> hip

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
going to look at here though is hip

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.590 
going to look at here though is hip
spread<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:41.250> hip<00:02:41.430> spread<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.300> simply

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
spread and the hip spread is just simply

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.110 
spread and the hip spread is just simply
enough<00:02:42.930> better<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> relic<00:02:43.800> because<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
enough better for the relic because the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.320 
enough better for the relic because the
the<00:02:45.930> insanity<00:02:46.709> has<00:02:46.890> plus<00:02:47.220> 10%<00:02:47.550> hips<00:02:48.209> spread

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the insanity has plus 10% hips spread

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.690 
the insanity has plus 10% hips spread
unfortunately<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.260> because<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.709> plus<00:02:50.490> 10

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
unfortunately so because of that plus 10

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.520 
unfortunately so because of that plus 10
points<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> relic<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.630> are<00:02:51.720> tied<00:02:51.930> 20<00:02:52.410> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
points for the relic we are tied 20 to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.110 
points for the relic we are tied 20 to
20<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> next<00:02:53.340> thing<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.730> we're<00:02:54.000> gonna

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
20 now the next thing that we're gonna

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.340 
20 now the next thing that we're gonna
look<00:02:54.330> at<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.780> thing<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.110> thought

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
look at is the thing that I thought

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.630 
look at is the thing that I thought
would<00:02:55.500> give<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.770> away<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.980> thought<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.490> them

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
would give it away I thought one of them

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.820 
would give it away I thought one of them
would<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.760> much<00:02:57.180> worse<00:02:57.750> recoil<00:02:58.290> pattern<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
would have much worse recoil pattern and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.170 
would have much worse recoil pattern and
as<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.220> turns<00:02:59.430> out<00:02:59.640> literally<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.980> exact

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
as it turns out literally the exact

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.000 
as it turns out literally the exact
exact<00:03:03.180> same<00:03:03.570> recoil<00:03:04.080> pattern<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> only<00:03:04.860> thing

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
exact same recoil pattern the only thing

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.350 
exact same recoil pattern the only thing
that'll<00:03:05.190> make<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.490> different<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.150> fire

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
that'll make it different is the fire

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840 
that'll make it different is the fire
rate<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:06.959> at<00:03:07.380> first<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.070> insanity<00:03:08.580> will<00:03:08.700> have

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
rate so at first the insanity will have

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.160 
rate so at first the insanity will have
a<00:03:08.880> worse<00:03:09.120> fire<00:03:09.360> rate<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:09.690> then<00:03:09.810> when<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.990> fire

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
a worse fire rate but then when the fire

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.440 
a worse fire rate but then when the fire
rate<00:03:10.380> slows<00:03:10.620> down<00:03:10.950> it'll<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> better<00:03:11.670> view

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
rate slows down it'll have a better view

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.710 
rate slows down it'll have a better view
kick<00:03:12.990> pattern<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.459> whereas<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> stg44

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
kick pattern so the whereas the stg44

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.509 
kick pattern so the whereas the stg44
relic<00:03:16.260> will<00:03:16.620> always<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.070> same<00:03:17.280> view

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
relic will always have the same view

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.160 
relic will always have the same view
kick<00:03:17.700> pattern<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:18.360> just<00:03:18.600> weird<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.019> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
kick pattern it's just weird like that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.710 
kick pattern it's just weird like that
but<00:03:19.320> literally<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.280> exact<00:03:20.970> same<00:03:21.269> recoil

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
but literally the exact same recoil

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.270 
but literally the exact same recoil
pattern<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:22.320> can't<00:03:22.500> give<00:03:22.650> any<00:03:22.800> points<00:03:23.160> out

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
pattern so we can't give any points out

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.759 
pattern so we can't give any points out
for<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.760> there's<00:03:24.540> really<00:03:24.900> nothing<00:03:25.350> else

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
for that and there's really nothing else

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.710 
for that and there's really nothing else
we<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.190> give<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.459> points<00:03:26.820> for<00:03:27.000> reload<00:03:27.420> time

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
we can give up points for reload time

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.180 
we can give up points for reload time
which<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.110> exactly<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.769> same<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.160> both

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
which is exactly the same for both

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.580 
which is exactly the same for both
weapons<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:30.050> what<00:03:31.050> we're<00:03:31.200> actually<00:03:31.350> gonna

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
weapons so what we're actually gonna

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.900 
weapons so what we're actually gonna
have<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.890> do<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> time<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> kill

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
have to do is do a time to kill

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.940 
have to do is do a time to kill
calculation<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:34.200> one's<00:03:34.440> very<00:03:34.530> very

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
calculation and this one's very very

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.580 
calculation and this one's very very
simple<00:03:35.340> simply<00:03:35.850> because<00:03:36.239> at<00:03:36.720> long<00:03:37.170> range<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
simple simply because at long range the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
simple simply because at long range the
hbra3<00:03:38.250> insanity<00:03:38.690> has<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.989> extra<00:03:40.560> one<00:03:41.040> damage

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
hbra3 insanity has that extra one damage

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.600 
hbra3 insanity has that extra one damage
that<00:03:41.880> makes<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.299> bullet<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.690> kill<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:43.260> less

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
that makes the bullet to kill one less

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.090 
that makes the bullet to kill one less
the<00:03:44.610> time<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.330> kill<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.840> actually<00:03:46.410> much<00:03:46.799> better

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
the time to kill is actually much better

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.830 
the time to kill is actually much better
for<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.580> insanity<00:03:47.820> almost<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.480> hundred

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
for the insanity almost a hundred

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.300 
for the insanity almost a hundred
milliseconds<00:03:49.380> which<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> lot

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
milliseconds which is a lot

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.640 
milliseconds which is a lot
it's<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.940> insanity<00:03:51.420> takes<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.200> because<00:03:52.410> of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
it's the insanity takes it so because of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.830 
it's the insanity takes it so because of
that<00:03:52.680> plus<00:03:53.340> 10<00:03:53.549> points<00:03:53.850> for<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.030> insanity<00:03:54.299> and

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
that plus 10 points for the insanity and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.050 
that plus 10 points for the insanity and
it<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.500> winner<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.920> week<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.489> just

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it is the winner this week it is just

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.420 
it is the winner this week it is just
just<00:03:57.959> slightly<00:03:58.560> better<00:03:58.709> for<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.040> relic<00:03:59.280> so

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
just slightly better for the relic so

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.199 
just slightly better for the relic so
