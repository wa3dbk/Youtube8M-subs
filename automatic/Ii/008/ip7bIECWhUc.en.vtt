right so pluck but this time you're
going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.780> go<00:02:55.080> down<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.830> with<00:02:56.459> your<00:02:56.640> brush<00:02:56.879> so

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
going to go down up with your brush so

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.839 
going to go down up with your brush so
it's<00:02:57.780> pluck<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:59.450> up<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:01.310> then<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.550> thumb

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
it's pluck down up and then you do thumb

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.440 
it's pluck down up and then you do thumb
by<00:03:03.000> itself<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:04.349> then<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.580> brush<00:03:05.879> but<00:03:06.269> this

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
by itself and then you do brush but this

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.970 
by itself and then you do brush but this
time<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.780> brush<00:03:07.050> up<00:03:07.290> down<00:03:07.910> up<00:03:08.910> down

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
time you brush up down up down

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.199 
time you brush up down up down
so<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.220> pluck<00:03:11.580> down<00:03:13.880> up<00:03:15.349> thumb<00:03:16.349> by<00:03:16.530> itself<00:03:17.209> up

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
so it's pluck down up thumb by itself up

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:38.199 
so it's pluck down up thumb by itself up
down<00:03:19.819> pluck<00:03:26.239> pluck

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.080 

by<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.200> way<00:04:00.409> I'm<00:04:00.980> using<00:04:01.250> my<00:04:01.519> third<00:04:01.849> finger

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
by the way I'm using my third finger

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.470 
by the way I'm using my third finger
just<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.900> anchor<00:04:03.099> myself<00:04:04.099> on<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.670> guitar<00:04:04.969> that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480

that's pretty much the whole song the

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.430 
that's pretty much the whole song the
patterns<00:05:55.759> repeat<00:05:56.180> throughout<00:05:56.479> the<00:05:56.780> verses<00:05:57.319> in

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440
