00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
maybe put up a white sheet so that it

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.190 
maybe put up a white sheet so that it
can<00:06:32.210> reduces<00:06:33.210> some<00:06:33.330> of<00:06:33.450> the<00:06:33.510> harshness<00:06:33.810> of<00:06:33.990> the

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200
