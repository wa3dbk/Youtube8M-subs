came down to talk about this crazy idea

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.710 
came down to talk about this crazy idea
that<00:00:20.830> I<00:00:20.859> had<00:00:21.130> and<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.939> didn't<00:00:22.210> really<00:00:22.300> work<00:00:22.419> out

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
that I had and it didn't really work out

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.420 
that I had and it didn't really work out
so<00:00:22.990> well<00:00:23.140> this<00:00:23.380> thing<00:00:23.590> called<00:00:23.770> a<00:00:23.860> slide<00:00:24.160> ride

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
so well this thing called a slide ride

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.490 
so well this thing called a slide ride
and<00:00:24.730> one<00:00:25.000> of<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.150> best<00:00:25.360> things<00:00:25.630> in<00:00:25.869> drifting

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
and one of the best things in drifting

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.979 
and one of the best things in drifting
is<00:00:26.650> really<00:00:27.039> being<00:00:27.310> able<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.579> drag<00:00:28.509> your<00:00:28.689> bumper

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
is really being able to drag your bumper

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.830 
is really being able to drag your bumper
on<00:00:29.079> a<00:00:29.110> wall<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.189> had<00:00:30.579> this<00:00:30.730> wild<00:00:31.210> idea<00:00:31.660> to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
on a wall so I had this wild idea to

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.260 
on a wall so I had this wild idea to
strap<00:00:32.140> in<00:00:32.430> fabricate<00:00:33.430> these<00:00:33.550> guardrails<00:00:33.940> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
strap in fabricate these guardrails and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.119 
strap in fabricate these guardrails and
put<00:00:34.360> it<00:00:34.450> on<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.629> side<00:00:34.840> of<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:35.020> cop<00:00:35.230> car<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:36.100> that

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
put it on the side of a cop car so that

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.860 
put it on the side of a cop car so that
I<00:00:36.340> could<00:00:36.850> have<00:00:37.090> Chris<00:00:37.390> drive<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.840> thing

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
I could have Chris drive the thing

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.080 
I could have Chris drive the thing
around<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.649> as<00:00:38.770> a<00:00:38.829> moving<00:00:39.340> clipping<00:00:39.730> point<00:00:39.879> or

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
around and as a moving clipping point or

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.850 
around and as a moving clipping point or
moving<00:00:40.420> wall<00:00:40.660> that<00:00:40.989> I<00:00:41.020> could<00:00:41.230> try<00:00:41.379> to<00:00:41.410> drag<00:00:41.710> my

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
moving wall that I could try to drag my

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.770 
moving wall that I could try to drag my
bumper<00:00:42.160> down<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.399> side<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:43.570> didn't

they're<00:00:59.840> just<00:01:00.140> cruising<00:01:06.610> wow<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.270> was<00:01:08.420> such

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630

a<00:01:08.660> wild<00:01:08.990> perspective<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.770> think<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.220> was<00:01:10.460> that

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
a wild perspective I think that was that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.730 
a wild perspective I think that was that
was<00:01:11.120> like<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.630> top<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.990> fourth<00:01:12.230> year<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:12.620> that

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
was like the top of fourth year and that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.890 
was like the top of fourth year and that
old<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.340> old<00:01:13.520> FB<00:01:13.910> chord<00:01:14.180> now<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> thousand

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
old on the old FB chord now a thousand

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.420 
old on the old FB chord now a thousand
eight<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.200> would<00:01:15.320> be<00:01:15.560> at<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.800> entry<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.250> was

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430
