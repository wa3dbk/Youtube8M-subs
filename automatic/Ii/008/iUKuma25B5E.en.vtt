to<00:03:06.150> see<00:03:06.299> at<00:03:06.389> first<00:03:06.689> but<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:06.959> actually<00:03:07.260> there

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439

just so that you can more easily get

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.129 
just so that you can more easily get
some<00:03:09.689> posing<00:03:10.109> without<00:03:10.400> losing<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.639> overall

structure of his torso armor and of
course<00:03:15.450> it's<00:03:15.599> risk<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.379> little

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
course it's risk to have this little

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.619 
course it's risk to have this little
tiny<00:03:16.739> wrist<00:03:17.040> joint<00:03:17.280> here<00:03:17.489> his<00:03:17.669> hips<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.269> not

tiny wrist joint here his hips are not
Revoltech<00:03:19.169> joints<00:03:19.829> these<00:03:20.400> are<00:03:20.639> just<00:03:20.849> like

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
Revoltech joints these are just like

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.059 
Revoltech joints these are just like
universal<00:03:21.989> joints<00:03:22.290> which<00:03:22.409> is<00:03:22.530> kind<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:22.889> cool

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
universal joints which is kind of cool

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.860 
universal joints which is kind of cool
because<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.909> means<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.209> you're<00:03:24.299> not<00:03:24.389> limited

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
because it means that you're not limited

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
because it means that you're not limited
by<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> number<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.349> clicks<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:26.190> know<00:03:26.549> they

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
by the number of clicks you know they

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.460 
by the number of clicks you know they
just<00:03:26.819> they<00:03:27.120> have<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.359> nice<00:03:27.569> range<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.049> movement

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
just they have a nice range of movement

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.979 
just they have a nice range of movement
I<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.010> layered<00:03:29.310> look<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:30.060> them<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.689> top

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
I like the layered look to them this top

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.689 
I like the layered look to them this top
pick<00:03:31.199> so<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.709> slides<00:03:32.069> around<00:03:32.310> every

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
pick so it kind of slides around every

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.309 
pick so it kind of slides around every
now<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.090> there's<00:03:33.569> also<00:03:33.689> a<00:03:33.780> thigh<00:03:33.959> swivel

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
now and then there's also a thigh swivel

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.099 
now and then there's also a thigh swivel
I<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.919> seen<00:03:35.280> photos<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.419> around<00:03:36.780> every

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
I have seen photos going around every

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.330 
I have seen photos going around every
now<00:03:37.229> and<00:03:37.379> then<00:03:37.439> someone<00:03:37.829> who<00:03:37.919> says<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.250> they

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
now and then someone who says that they

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.339 
now and then someone who says that they
have<00:03:38.579> horrifically<00:03:39.120> broken<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:39.810> leg<00:03:40.049> joint

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
have horrifically broken this leg joint

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.740 
have horrifically broken this leg joint
I<00:03:40.530> don't<00:03:41.159> see<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.699> happening<00:03:41.819> on<00:03:42.180> mine<00:03:42.419> but

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
I don't see it happening on mine but

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.839 
I don't see it happening on mine but
maybe<00:03:43.439> I'm<00:03:43.650> lucky<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.129> just<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.400> careful<00:03:44.759> with

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
maybe I'm lucky so just be careful with

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.050 
maybe I'm lucky so just be careful with
it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.149 
it
there<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.870> one<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.109> these<00:03:46.169> double<00:03:46.799> jointed

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
there is one of these double jointed

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.339 
there is one of these double jointed
Revoltech<00:03:47.489> joints<00:03:47.970> inside<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.449> knee<00:03:48.629> which

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
Revoltech joints inside the knee which

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.619 
Revoltech joints inside the knee which
gets<00:03:50.189> a<00:03:50.250> good<00:03:50.400> range<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.729> movement<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.180> the

gets a good range of movement and the

gets a good range of movement and the

knee cap has a rebel tech joint much

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.530 
knee cap has a rebel tech joint much
like<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.519> wrist<00:03:53.699> pegs<00:03:53.909> and<00:03:54.060> shoulder<00:03:54.299> pads

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
like the wrist pegs and shoulder pads

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.439 
like the wrist pegs and shoulder pads
that<00:03:54.810> allows<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.229> to<00:03:55.259> do<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.889> which<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:57.150> not

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
that allows it to do that which is not

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.969 
that allows it to do that which is not
all<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.629> helpful<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.169> this<00:03:58.379> kind<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.709> seems

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
all that helpful this this kind of seems

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.199 
all that helpful this this kind of seems
a<00:03:59.129> little<00:03:59.189> bit<00:03:59.370> superfluous<00:03:59.819> because<00:04:00.060> it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
a little bit superfluous because it

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.399 
a little bit superfluous because it
doesn't<00:04:00.449> really<00:04:00.569> seem<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> accomplish

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
doesn't really seem to accomplish

doesn't really seem to accomplish
anything

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
anything

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.520 
anything
maybe<00:04:03.000> I'm<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.329> missing<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.139> he's<00:04:04.349> got

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
maybe I'm just missing it and he's got

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.159 
maybe I'm just missing it and he's got
Revoltech<00:04:04.799> joints<00:04:05.250> on<00:04:05.340> his<00:04:05.489> ankles<00:04:06.169> which

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
Revoltech joints on his ankles which

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.899 
Revoltech joints on his ankles which
also<00:04:07.439> allows<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.709> some<00:04:07.979> cool<00:04:08.189> ankle<00:04:08.519> tilting

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
also allows for some cool ankle tilting

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.909 
also allows for some cool ankle tilting
one<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.689> the<00:04:09.780> other<00:04:09.900> problems<00:04:10.229> is<00:04:10.349> that<00:04:10.590> when

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
one of the other problems is that when

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.379 
one of the other problems is that when
you<00:04:10.979> tilt<00:04:11.129> his<00:04:11.280> ankles<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:11.849> part<00:04:12.120> doesn't

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
you tilt his ankles this part doesn't

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.610 
you tilt his ankles this part doesn't
move<00:04:12.509> down<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.019> I<00:04:13.109> think<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.409> looks<00:04:13.530> a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
move down and I think that looks a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.939 
move down and I think that looks a
little<00:04:13.799> bit<00:04:14.099> like<00:04:14.340> flared<00:04:14.879> bell-bottoms<00:04:15.949> the

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
little bit like flared bell-bottoms the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.529 
little bit like flared bell-bottoms the
only<00:04:17.489> real<00:04:17.699> problem<00:04:17.909> with<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.329> guy

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
only real problem with this guy

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.689 
only real problem with this guy
poseability<00:04:19.349> wise<00:04:19.650> because<00:04:20.009> his<00:04:20.250> joint<00:04:20.549> edge

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
poseability wise because his joint edge

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.310 
poseability wise because his joint edge
is<00:04:20.909> all<00:04:21.060> fine<00:04:21.329> he's<00:04:21.539> got<00:04:21.690> all<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.959> joints<00:04:22.260> he

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
is all fine he's got all the joints he

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.709 
is all fine he's got all the joints he
needs<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:23.370> problem<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.210> there<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.450> lot<00:04:24.570> of

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
needs the problem is that there a lot of

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.120 
needs the problem is that there a lot of
them<00:04:24.870> are<00:04:24.990> Revoltech<00:04:25.229> joints<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.919> means

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
them are Revoltech joints and that means

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.409 
them are Revoltech joints and that means
that<00:04:26.450> like<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.719> shoulder

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
that like the shoulder

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.749 
that like the shoulder
can<00:04:28.960> move<00:04:29.169> there<00:04:29.500> or<00:04:29.770> there<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.520> can't

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
can move there or there but I can't

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.400 
can move there or there but I can't
really<00:04:30.880> easily<00:04:31.210> go<00:04:31.419> in<00:04:31.570> between<00:04:31.720> those<00:04:32.169> two

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
really easily go in between those two

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.969 
really easily go in between those two
points<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.370> articulation<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.350> think<00:04:35.860> it's

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
points of articulation and I think it's

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.010 
points of articulation and I think it's
a<00:04:36.220> problem<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:36.880> didn't<00:04:37.150> have<00:04:37.360> before<00:04:37.660> with

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
a problem that I didn't have before with

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.379 
a problem that I didn't have before with
Revoltech<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.800> as<00:04:39.009> time<00:04:39.550> goes<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.060> find

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
Revoltech that as time goes on I find

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.240 
Revoltech that as time goes on I find
it's<00:04:40.600> starting<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.930> get<00:04:41.080> less<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.410> less<00:04:41.710> fun

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
it's starting to get less and less fun

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.960 
it's starting to get less and less fun
to<00:04:42.280> mess<00:04:42.580> with<00:04:42.759> these<00:04:42.850> guys<00:04:42.910> as<00:04:44.520> overall<00:04:45.520> toy

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
to mess with these guys as overall toy

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.340 
to mess with these guys as overall toy
engineering<00:04:46.509> has<00:04:46.630> gotten<00:04:46.900> better<00:04:47.080> and

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
engineering has gotten better and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.770 
engineering has gotten better and
Revoltech<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.520> still<00:04:48.729> kind<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.539> it's

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
Revoltech is still kind of it's it's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.810 
Revoltech is still kind of it's it's
sticking<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.199> this<00:04:50.410> gameplan<00:04:50.949> it<00:04:51.130> has<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.610> I

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
sticking to this gameplan it has and I

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.150 
sticking to this gameplan it has and I
kind<00:04:52.449> of<00:04:52.479> respect<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.990> but<00:04:53.350> at<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.009> same

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
kind of respect that but at the same

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.600 
kind of respect that but at the same
time<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.850> just<00:04:55.419> don't<00:04:55.570> know<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:56.050> mean<00:04:56.289> it's<00:04:57.009> kind

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
time I just don't know I mean it's kind
