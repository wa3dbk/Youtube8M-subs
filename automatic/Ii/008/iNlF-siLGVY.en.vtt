we're<00:00:03.750> gonna<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> comparison<00:00:04.859> between<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
we're gonna do a comparison between the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.039 
we're gonna do a comparison between the
code<00:00:05.430> book<00:00:05.640> prodigy<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.660> John<00:00:06.870> Paul

finish it has a high grade round stick

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.969 
finish it has a high grade round stick
and<00:01:50.820> silver<00:01:51.149> alloy<00:01:51.540> tip<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.470> ever<00:01:52.590> show<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and silver alloy tip you ever show that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.100 
and silver alloy tip you ever show that
real<00:01:53.130> quick<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.119> railway<00:01:54.450> tip<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:57.960> see

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
real quick so railway tip you can see

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
real quick so railway tip you can see
that<00:01:58.290> alloy<00:01:58.560> tip<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.070> doesn't<00:01:59.250> chip<00:01:59.670> off

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that alloy tip so that doesn't chip off

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.240 
that alloy tip so that doesn't chip off
or<00:02:00.119> break<00:02:00.270> again<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.290> carbon<00:02:01.649> fiber<00:02:01.860> also

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
or break again that's carbon fiber also

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.819 
or break again that's carbon fiber also
so<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.149> drop<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.630> doesn't<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:04.619> gonna

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
so you drop it it doesn't it's not gonna

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.230 
so you drop it it doesn't it's not gonna
completely<00:02:05.159> snap<00:02:05.610> or<00:02:05.790> anything<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.180> that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
and that's one of the reasons that I

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.290 
and that's one of the reasons that I
like<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:36.250> they<00:03:36.610> have<00:03:36.850> about<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.270> same

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
like it and they have about the same

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.160 
like it and they have about the same
sounds<00:03:38.170> they<00:03:38.320> both<00:03:38.590> have<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.900> tips<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.110> the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
sounds they both have the tips in the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.290 
sounds they both have the tips in the
same<00:03:41.410> tip<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.490> I<00:03:42.610> think<00:03:42.880> they<00:03:43.060> both<00:03:43.240> have

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
same tip and I think they both have

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.190 
same tip and I think they both have
about<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.840> same<00:03:44.050> quality<00:03:44.560> hair<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.270> think

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
about the same quality hair but I think

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.080 
about the same quality hair but I think
the<00:03:47.410> feel<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.890> what<00:03:48.100> gives<00:03:48.340> away<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:48.730> Cobell

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
the feel is what gives away the Cobell

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.180 
the feel is what gives away the Cobell
