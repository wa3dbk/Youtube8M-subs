00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.490
 below those who can see in more detail the French and classes of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.210
 a repair 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 before starting the repair we must clean the area with a rag paper 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.389
 damp 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.769
 it is examined if in the break before starting the repair to make sure 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.960
 with what reading equipment we are going to work 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 we must drill the windshield right at the point of impact so that we 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.720
 facilitate the air outlet and the entrance of mika crystal 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.230
 we must indicate the suckers to avoid that they take off while we are in the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.130
 repair process 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.490
 once we have signed them we put the easel on the break 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.530
 if possible with the 200 ac at the base and one at the top 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 we put the seal on the undefeated 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 after placing the seal that we are not injecting into the building of the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.070
 easel until the seal touches and glass loosely 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 Now we must check from the other side of the windshield that the hole in the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.570
 seal are centered on the point of impact that we have moved 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.180
 if it is not, we will move the easel until it is centered 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.820
 we throw the micro glass through the indec building all 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.799
 we will connect the Andalusians all through the connector 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.100
 we will connect the vacuum pump pressure to the probe by the other connected 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 Once the vacuum pump is connected to the probe, we will create a vacuum 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.100
 then we will disconnect the socket from the probe and leave it a vacuum during 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.900
 ten minutes 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.740
 we release the multiposition clamp and apply the regulating pressure 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.940
 previously the pump wheel to apply the specific pressure for the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 type of break we are repairing 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
 we will leave the pressure for ten minutes 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.600
 I noticed how the break is disappearing under the orange seal until 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 that is totally imperceptible 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.779
 we jumped the multi-position clamp to release the pressure 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.799
 With the blade we release the suction cups of the trestle to remove it 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.559
 we went with the blade with the top of the opening to eliminate the micro glass 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.609
 surplus 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.869
 we throw a glass-finish glass door over the impact point and the 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.779
 we cover with the catalyst sheet 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.430
 we place the ultraviolet lamp on openings for ten minutes 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.229
 once the ten minutes have passed we remove the lamp 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.539
 ultraviolet 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:54.219
 with the blade we raise in the mine and spend the finishing micro glass 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.199
 has been catalyzed until they are not the point of impact in a gray color 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.829
 we assemble the polishing disc in the drill we polish on the break 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 and we could repair the area for a minute 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 to finish we clean and glass 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.399
 I appreciate the difference between the impacted glass at the top and a 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.589
 glass repaired with the internal technology 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.370
 both our equipment and tare repair made with our meter 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.859
 crystal meets the following European regulations
