00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.870 
doesn't make it any harder than it has
to<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:17.070> that's<00:04:18.070> one<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.459> things<00:04:18.519> I've

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
to be and that's one of the things I've

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.970 
to be and that's one of the things I've
always<00:04:19.060> admired<00:04:19.299> about<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.900> why<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.169> find<00:04:20.859> that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
always admired about the why I find that

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.250

to<00:04:21.130> be<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> very<00:04:24.000> refined<00:04:25.230> characteristic<00:04:26.230> that

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
to be a very refined characteristic that

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.409 
to be a very refined characteristic that
not<00:04:26.590> every<00:04:27.160> piano<00:04:27.430> has<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.120> definitely

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
not every piano has and it's definitely

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.590 
not every piano has and it's definitely
not<00:04:28.570> something<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.080> be<00:04:29.200> taken<00:04:29.230> for<00:04:29.680> granted

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
not something to be taken for granted
