00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.670 
of eyelashes you can get to you for a
pound<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.170> work<00:02:14.380> quite<00:02:14.650> well

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
I'll probably use them once and not

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.750 
I'll probably use them once and not
again<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:19.920> stop<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.310> really<00:02:20.520> quick

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330 
but i'm gonna put on so you can see how
it<00:02:36.480> would<00:02:36.660> look<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.500> could<00:02:37.650> tie<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it would look so you could tie it in a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.300 
it would look so you could tie it in a
bow<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.900> side<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.709> looks<00:02:40.920> so
