and put it on a little work area so now
we<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.400> check<00:00:15.030> out<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.389> wheel<00:00:15.570> make<00:00:16.560> sure

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
we can check out the wheel make sure

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.680 
we can check out the wheel make sure
nothing's<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.609> know<00:00:17.730> super<00:00:18.180> bent<00:00:18.449> or

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
anything
check<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> rotor<00:00:22.020> make<00:00:22.619> sure<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.949> doesn't

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
check the rotor make sure it doesn't

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880 
check the rotor make sure it doesn't
look<00:00:23.340> bent<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.590> you'd<00:00:25.740> like

and your fingernails is is like actually
falling<00:00:34.469> into<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:35.130> divots<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.880> then

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
falling into little divots in there then

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.639 
falling into little divots in there then
the<00:00:36.420> rotor<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> bad<00:00:36.960> because<00:00:37.350> what's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the rotor is bad because what's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
the rotor is bad because what's
happening<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.969> pieces<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.360> dirt<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
happening is little pieces of dirt and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.479 
happening is little pieces of dirt and
rocks<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.680> everything<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.070> getting<00:00:41.370> in

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
rocks and everything are getting in

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
rocks and everything are getting in
there<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.940> grinding<00:00:42.629> these<00:00:43.320> grooves<00:00:43.770> in

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
there and it's grinding these grooves in

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
there and it's grinding these grooves in
there<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> that's<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.260> cause

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there and that's going to just cause

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.319 
there and that's going to just cause
heat<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> friction<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
heat and friction and it's just it's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.889 
heat and friction and it's just it's
just<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.539> good<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:48.989> brakes<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.570> these<00:00:51.570> ones

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
just not good for brakes so these ones

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
just not good for brakes so these ones
look<00:00:52.020> pretty<00:00:52.410> good<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> go

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
look pretty good but we're going to go

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.670 
look pretty good but we're going to go
ahead<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> replace<00:00:53.789> them<00:00:54.440> we're<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.559> going

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
ahead and replace them we're just going

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
ahead and replace them we're just going
to<00:00:55.710> take<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.280> off<00:00:56.489> real<00:00:56.760> quick<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> get

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
to take these off real quick and get

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.740 
to take these off real quick and get
them<00:00:58.199> switched<00:00:58.500> out<00:01:05.330> now<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> be

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
them switched out now you got to be

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.649 
them switched out now you got to be
really<00:01:07.439> careful<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.520> when<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> work

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
really careful because when you work

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
really careful because when you work
with<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> front<00:01:10.830> brakes<00:01:11.270> when<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> work<00:01:12.540> with

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
with the front brakes when you work with

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
with the front brakes when you work with
rotors<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.290> any<00:01:13.500> motorcycles<00:01:14.159> I've<00:01:14.400> come<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
rotors on any motorcycles I've come to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.200 
rotors on any motorcycles I've come to
see<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.740> bolts<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.850> really

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
see that the bolts right here are really

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.810 
see that the bolts right here are really
temperamental<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.650> don't<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> torque

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
temperamental you don't want to torque

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
temperamental you don't want to torque
them<00:01:20.970> real<00:01:21.210> hard<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.689> anything<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.409> they

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
them real hard or anything because they

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
them real hard or anything because they
do<00:01:22.619> tend<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> strip<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.970> easy<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
do tend to strip out really easy so you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.350 
do tend to strip out really easy so you
just<00:01:25.170> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
just want to kind of get in there and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.319 
just want to kind of get in there and
wiggle<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> loose<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:29.329> because

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
wiggle it loose just like that because

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.929 
wiggle it loose just like that because
if<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:31.079> unbalanced<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.729> just

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
if if you're unbalanced and you just

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
if if you're unbalanced and you just
yank<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> strip<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.890> then

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
yank on it you can strip it out and then

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.810 
yank on it you can strip it out and then
you're<00:01:35.490> never<00:01:35.729> getting<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you're never getting that thing out so I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
you're never getting that thing out so I
like<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.689> go<00:01:39.869> around<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.159> all

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
like to just go around and get them all

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.359 
like to just go around and get them all
loose<00:01:42.259> just<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
loose just so I know I'm not going to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:54.230 
loose just so I know I'm not going to
have<00:01:44.520> any<00:01:45.020> problems<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.340> any<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.579> them

normally when you work on bikes unless
it<00:01:57.490> comes<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.150> like<00:01:58.800> internal<00:01:59.800> parts<00:02:00.460> or

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
anything I use all hand tools just do it

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.820 
anything I use all hand tools just do it
all<00:02:03.729> by<00:02:03.880> hand<00:02:04.150> you<00:02:04.450> start<00:02:04.660> putting<00:02:05.500> because<00:02:05.800> a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
all by hand you start putting because a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.710 
all by hand you start putting because a
lot<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.250> bikes<00:02:06.460> are<00:02:06.640> aluminum<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.330> you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
lot of the bikes are aluminum and you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.199 
lot of the bikes are aluminum and you
start<00:02:07.960> using<00:02:08.320> air<00:02:08.649> tools<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.160> stuff<00:02:09.399> you're

going<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.450> strip<00:02:10.780> something<00:02:11.110> out<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> just<00:02:13.630> try

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
going to strip something out so just try

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.350 
going to strip something out so just try
to<00:02:13.840> keep<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.410> just<00:02:14.650> hand<00:02:15.070> tools<00:02:15.340> unless<00:02:16.209> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
to keep it to just hand tools unless you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.199 
to keep it to just hand tools unless you
really<00:02:16.540> know<00:02:16.720> what<00:02:16.750> you're<00:02:16.990> doing<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.880> then

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
really know what you're doing and then

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.670 
really know what you're doing and then
BAM<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.830> old<00:02:26.980> rotor<00:02:27.280> right<00:02:27.520> there

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
BAM that's the old rotor right there

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.229 
BAM that's the old rotor right there
so<00:02:31.020> we'll<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.200> get<00:02:33.190> ones<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.550> are<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
so we'll just get ones that are now you

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.030 
so we'll just get ones that are now you
have<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> couple<00:02:34.900> options<00:02:35.110> when<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.680> comes<00:02:35.860> to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
have a couple options when it comes to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.970 
have a couple options when it comes to
rotors<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.750> could<00:02:37.959> either<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.770> same

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
rotors you could either get the same

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.920 
rotors you could either get the same
factory<00:02:39.400> replacement<00:02:39.700> which<00:02:40.480> would<00:02:40.780> be

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
factory replacement which would be

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.229 
factory replacement which would be
something<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.500> like<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.890> or<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:43.120> could

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
something just like this or you could

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.810 
something just like this or you could
step<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.760> know<00:02:45.910> wave<00:02:46.600> rotor<00:02:47.080> or

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
step it up to a you know wave rotor or

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.479 
step it up to a you know wave rotor or
cross-drilled<00:02:48.820> slotted<00:02:49.390> rotor<00:02:50.489> lighter

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
cross-drilled slotted rotor lighter

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.670 
cross-drilled slotted rotor lighter
rotors<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.360> lot<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.870> different<00:02:53.140> companies<00:02:53.440> out

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
rotors a lot of different companies out

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.100 
rotors a lot of different companies out
there<00:02:53.890> make<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.540> specialize<00:02:55.540> in<00:02:55.810> brake

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
there make and specialize in brake

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.600 
there make and specialize in brake
rotors<00:02:56.470> for<00:02:56.650> bikes<00:02:56.860> because<00:02:57.190> it's<00:02:57.400> very

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
rotors for bikes because it's very

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.759 
rotors for bikes because it's very
important<00:02:58.090> on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.269> bike<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.320> case<00:02:59.530> we're

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
important on the bike in this case we're

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.370 
important on the bike in this case we're
just<00:02:59.799> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.040> switch<00:03:00.220> them<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.580> with<00:03:00.790> some

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
just going to switch them out with some

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.610 
just going to switch them out with some
factory<00:03:02.380> style<00:03:02.680> rotors<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:04.470> what<00:03:05.470> you're

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
factory style rotors and what you're

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.979 
factory style rotors and what you're
going<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.830> need<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.310> basically<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.630> new<00:03:07.780> rotor

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
going to need is basically the new rotor

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.530 
going to need is basically the new rotor
and<00:03:08.350> you're<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.829> need<00:03:09.040> Loctite<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.790> in

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and you're going to need Loctite and in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.520 
and you're going to need Loctite and in
this<00:03:10.660> case<00:03:10.870> we're<00:03:11.019> going<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.200> use<00:03:11.320> blue

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
this case we're going to use blue

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.640 
this case we're going to use blue
loctite<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.600> that's<00:03:13.600> pretty<00:03:14.140> much<00:03:14.410> all

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
loctite and that's pretty much all

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.440 
loctite and that's pretty much all
you're<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.100> need<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.519> do<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.120> rotor

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
you're going to need to do a rotor

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.840 
you're going to need to do a rotor
