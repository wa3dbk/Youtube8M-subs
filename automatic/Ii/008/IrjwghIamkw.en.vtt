about<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:23.609> either<00:00:23.880> one<00:00:24.119> turn<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.359> one<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
about I think either one turn or one and

about I think either one turn or one and

the circuit board and pretty much

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.470 
the circuit board and pretty much
decided<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.880> covered<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> thing<00:00:33.360> with

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
decided that and covered the thing with

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.670 
decided that and covered the thing with

for<00:00:45.719> listening<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.829> probably<00:00:47.010> got<00:00:47.219> for

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
for listening in this I probably got for

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
for listening in this I probably got for
like<00:00:47.700> maybe<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.809> couple<00:00:48.960> cents<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> fifty

this<00:01:19.860> guy's<00:01:20.009> good<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> 100<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.750> 100<00:01:21.750> volts

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this guy's good up to 100 and 100 volts

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.609 
this guy's good up to 100 and 100 volts
but<00:01:22.710> those<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.490> 106<00:01:24.000> bucks<00:01:24.330> each<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:27.619> rather

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
but those are 106 bucks each so rather

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
but those are 106 bucks each so rather
than<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.299> pieces<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
than get the one of these pieces of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
than get the one of these pieces of
garbage<00:01:33.049> just<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.200> one<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> these<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
garbage just get one of these and this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.719 
garbage just get one of these and this
make<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> box<00:01:36.710> for<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
make a box for it because this is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.700 
make a box for it because this is
designed<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.450> originally<00:01:40.320> intended<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
designed for originally intended for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
designed for originally intended for
things<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.070> recreational<00:01:41.729> vehicles<00:01:42.119> well

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
things like recreational vehicles well

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.999 
things like recreational vehicles well
there'd<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.229> an<00:01:43.290> electrical<00:01:43.680> panel<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
there'd be an electrical panel of a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.149 
there'd be an electrical panel of a
mountain<00:01:44.369> thing<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
mountain thing and this one about the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
mountain thing and this one about the
only<00:01:47.369> thing<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> can

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
only thing going for it is that it can

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.410 
only thing going for it is that it can
just<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.590> mounted<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.220> backplane<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
just be mounted to a backplane and it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
just be mounted to a backplane and it
can<00:01:51.540> run<00:01:51.689> wires<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.280> make<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
can run wires to it but if you make a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.830 
can run wires to it but if you make a
box<00:01:53.729> you've<00:01:53.970> got<00:01:54.149> room<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.390> things<00:01:54.689> like

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
box you've got room for things like

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.469 
box you've got room for things like
