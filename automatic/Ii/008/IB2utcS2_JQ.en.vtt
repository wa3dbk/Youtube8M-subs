 simply the team of the year the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.590
 tell you about the totti and the market of 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.480
 transfers that is going to be really very 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 I am accompanied today 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 Pro in quotation marks from the purchase 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.199
 resale on facebook on twitter on 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.369
 youtube on twitter everywhere I 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.989
 think if you like the charraud 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.760
 need to know you this is of course 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.860
 el niÃ±o paws it's not how you go 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.719
 Archos is one with the world it will 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 very well and you beat annick is nickel 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.610
 so we created a hashtag on twitter 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 because I saw that a lot of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.579
 people on twitter ask us 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 questions in relation to the totti when 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.719
 should we invest on which 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 players it is necessary to finally invest full of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.440
 questions and that's why with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.270
 paws we had the idea to make a video 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 so for those who do not know 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.870
 skate I want to remind that in the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.579
 info bar in the description there 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.439
 will have all these pages directly for 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.670
 follow him is the guy he must follow 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.619
 for the marathon if you want to do 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.510
 the good shots in any case you we 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.040
 have asked a lot of good questions 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 chose five or six in more 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 exactly we will go read from 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.259
 now the discos ok so that kevin 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.610
 series is that they ask us the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.680
 first question why the market 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780
 drop actually tells us not all 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.590
 why during totti such a big 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.770
 drop down because it's a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.900
 event of the year so the tati and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.900
 during this event, there will be 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 a support hour match of packs at 100 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 case packs to 60k and so there will be 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.670
 a fine easter of the cuckoo players in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.170
 sale and so the prices go down 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 continually yeah that's normal poker 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 no now someone confesses that 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.299
 his nickname is a little weird but 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.890
 it does not matter who asks us 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 question the prices will start to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.399
 lower that in and go re and increases and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.380
 what does it tell us all paws a little bit 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 on on the fluctuations will say that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.399
 like that prices during totti then 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 in fact there will be two key moments to 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.700
 buying players so there will soon 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.369
 Monday actually on a very big drop 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.680
 prices because the first defender 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.560
 go out and suddenly everyone will 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.810
 be on the lookout and the last opportunity 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.129
 so it will be the weekend so between the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.170
 Friday Saturday and Sunday 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.750
 because there will be the attackers and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.610
 the whole team totti and the Sunday of 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.349
 10 inches so it's the pac is at bottom so 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.090
 the market will be a lower yeah normal 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.650
 everyone wants to catch a little 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.819
 cristiano ronaldo in the bins this is a 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.980
 little home logical one will 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.599
 say that like that so paul moulard who 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 ask us this question this time 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.400
 do I have to buy Irish players 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.989
 for st-patrick during the workshop 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.910
 so if a very good question because 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.860
 that the st-patrick will not delay I'm 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.569
 your word skin mate ba listening is a 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.489
 very good question which is a very 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.810
 good idea also to invest for during 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.819
 the little one for saint patrick 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 simply because March 17th 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.099
 2015 lee evans or go out like every 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.840
 year a cut events so suddenly 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.049
 the center at saint patrick and suddenly 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.700
 it will take a team that Irish is 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.560
 so we can invest now 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.720
 so not before a new question to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.519
 what a gossip moment we need 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.260
 resell our players and when should we 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.150
 concocted our dream team at most 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.620
 low price i let you speak pad 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.680
 I hope you will have the answer that 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.049
 I admit that there is listening is very 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.430
 simple when we sell our players we can 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.590
 already start making them as soon as 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.140
 now 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.480
 because during all there is actually 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.640
 asked me is really to have a 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.890
 price variation so you really have to 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.340
 sell now and buy your players 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.040
 so saturday sunday during mattotti 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.830
 it's clear and it will be the lowest 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.239
 price there will be masses of easter of the 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.470
 blow that puts calm packets back into place 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.330
 price aspas what's that basically 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.680
 exactly and we can do good 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.420
 business yeah that's for sure 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.940
 so we're already coming to the last 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.190
 question of this video in quotation marks 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.620
 info it's ryan who we pause and he 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.780
 tells us which players to invest in 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.489
 particular people of a form players 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 who will not be no to youthful totti 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.110
 the word what we propose 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.450
 pepy players atolls will tell us everything 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.610
 paw on the players to invest during 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.989
 this totti then already to start one 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.730
 can really invest especially the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.220
 players it will depend on your budget 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.329
 of your desire to invest but what 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.979
 that happens you can invest either 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.350
 no matter what I see now me 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.039
 I have bad three players who are in 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.300
 different price ranges and 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.990
 do not really have to focus 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.210
 above 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.919
 so it's not really a business in 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.310
 however, I know that their prices have 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.500
 fallen 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.660
 like every other day but in 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.770
 particular because it works 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.050
 very good for buying resale in 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.180
 general so let's start with alexis 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:50.740
 sanchez which costs 48 cases about 54 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.120
 other box on the xbox market sorry there 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.250
 will lose his price he will lose at least 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.770
 20% is about the range that 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.870
 I give is also an angel players 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.210
 di maria which costs about 100 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.210
 case it's still on the xbox market 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.749
 who will also lose we'll say 30 yeah 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.519
 it's not really going to be 30% maybe a little bit 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.899
 less but whatever happens it will be 

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.459
 still a nice case and then I 

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.919
 will finish with my nugget mast 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:18.609
 it's gareth bale that will bauer him more 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:21.339
 500 cases but it goes at least 10 

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:23.949
 minutes without breaking on even 150 cases and 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.519
 it could easily be made 600 cases 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.589
 ready for everything 

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:28.449
 so here are the guys gave you a 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:29.739
 little bit of advice on all 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.149
 players it's like he said it on 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:33.639
 during at totti every day have 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:34.839
 dropped practically must see if the 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.159
 ronaldo and his bombs and that's 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.179
 normally and should go down but 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.089
 as they will be in the totti on 

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:42.189
 never know but in any case the great 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:44.559
 part of the players on foot will go down 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.049
 and indulge so alexis sanchez who 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.999
 will not lose a lot at all in very small 

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:51.369
 maria and to finish gareth bale but 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.839
 of course everything depends on your budget in 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:55.629
 Anyway I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.009
 this video info on the totti because 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.139
 here I have seen many ask me and 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.389
 videos info compared to the totti that 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.189
 was coming to the crash market market that 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.689
 can as we can call it above 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.549
 here I hope you will have appreciated thank you 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.739
 to you no short and advice if 

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:10.839
 pressure will say that like that and then 

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:12.759
 here we are being taken care of 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.719
 thank you again pat you have all the 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.719
