00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 Hello everyone and I bring you a couple of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.240
 tricks on the blank bourget map 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.529
 fearful the zombies good as is 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.930
 saying they were psychotic and strikeouts 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.740
 right in that corner here 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.480
 trying to make the new system already 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.830
 you know we put a trap and the same 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.990
 once we jump we will stay a little in the air 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.220
 and then we put a second mother like 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.759
 you see here psychotic just stayed 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.350
 in the corner here stuck and made a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
 good barrier 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.239
 I already showed two tricks here 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.469
 precisely in this same place what 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.059
 happens that this is after the patch or 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.860
 either after patch will make the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 trampoline not now with the new system 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.019
 well, we can climb, it's worth this 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.329
 it would be a part of the trick of the video 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.890
 ok here we will create as I say a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.659
 good psychotic barrier I do not know if I could 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.489
 kill the zombies well I'm not very 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.930
 sure but good me and then we are for 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.449
 in there and we can kill them quite 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.940
 fine and then cease at the same time he did 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.330
 another barrier is just inside 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.710
 the titan zone is worth what you have 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.479
 to do either of the two 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.560
 I recommend that you make this voucher 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 is doing psychotic right now that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.690
 right in this hall here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.090
 right in that corner of the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.710
 left is worth this is the best because 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.149
 all the players are left to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.850
 end of this hall comes no 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.740
 zombie we can kill quietly good 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.080
 what he did that was to get on 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 which is on top of the machine the titan and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.740
 he stayed in a hidden room worth a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.149
 secret room but can not do 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.619
 nothing and no zombies are going but not 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.119
 can kill zombies and can not do anything 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 It's worth as you see the zombies are 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.360
 they were there just in front of the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.679
 barrels to the adjusted when the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.479
 I jump that in front of the barrels in 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.250
 each side the zombies and then the rest 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.140
 they stayed here with chicote 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 ok but as I say if you have to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.980
 choose one of the two choose this from 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.390
 here in the east corridor because it's 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.250
 you are seeing now is worth the titan 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 as I say, you'll get stuck there if 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.540
 You can not go out but it's good for 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.190
 who wants to know how to do it 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 simply possessed you place here the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.510
 first trap is worth to jump and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.040
 that is more or less at that height and 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.680
 then the other partner has to come 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.940
 and when the trap prompts you leave it 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.009
 little higher up, what are you going to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 see now then once and leave it already 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.330
 above you can get inside will not die 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.910
 but now you will see that just 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 When I went up I passed by and I 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 falls to the void I died so it's good 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.930
 it's just this I taught you a couple 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.670
 of barriers basically is worth here as 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.080
 you are seeing then that remains 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 right here inside but can not anymore 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 continue here can not kill well 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.160
 that is not worth much worth more 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.530
 worth the first voucher and good is what 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.730
 you are seeing now, not there are they staying 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.100
 some zombies in a barrier and others 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 zombies in the other but much better 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.430
 better the one in which he is psychotic 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.510
 imagine because more secure so good 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.860
 it is simply this I hope that I have 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.209
 liked if you liked to like I like 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.510
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.750
 health video 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 Y
