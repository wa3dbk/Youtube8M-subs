00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
going to get sound effects or phrases

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
going to get sound effects or phrases
and<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.869> lights<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> light<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.500> as

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350 
and the lights are going to light up as
well<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.700> we'll<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.000> we'll<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.270> this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
well so what we'll do is we'll get this

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
well so what we'll do is we'll get this
out<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> box<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.590> he<00:01:22.650> does<00:01:23.689> alright

then

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
then
so<00:01:25.259> we've<00:01:25.500> blade<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> box<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
so we've blade out of the box you can

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.550 
so we've blade out of the box you can
have<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> better<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.720> at<00:01:27.990> always<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> do

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
have a better look at always going to do

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.660
