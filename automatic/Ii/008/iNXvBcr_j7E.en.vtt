can get is as much mess right as
possible<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.770> phantom

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
possible and I don't know about phantom

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
possible and I don't know about phantom
cards<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.810> work<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.500> personal

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710

card three cards max
so<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.260> would<00:01:29.410> be<00:01:29.440> extra<00:01:29.770> twelve<00:01:30.070> percent

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
so that would be extra twelve percent

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.970 
so that would be extra twelve percent
but<00:01:30.730> since<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.450> small<00:01:31.750> things<00:01:32.050> do<00:01:32.290> not<00:01:32.440> work<00:01:32.500> I

doubt<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.300> doubt<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.870> cards<00:01:35.170> work

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
doubt that I doubt that the cards work

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
drop in this server so i should have

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.280 
drop in this server so i should have

mess up 15 person messes up the third
line<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> ten<00:02:24.790> percent<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:25.930> i<00:02:26.740> would<00:02:27.490> i<00:02:27.700> could

means legendary line if you go to change

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.100 
means legendary line if you go to change
the<00:02:48.940> lines<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.239> actually<00:02:49.480> see<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.810> on

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the lines you can actually see you on

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.860 
the lines you can actually see you on
the<00:02:50.290> legendary<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.220> unique<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.840> of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
the legendary so unique and because of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.040 
the legendary so unique and because of
that<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.370> keep<00:02:54.850> two<00:02:55.330> legendary

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
that you have to keep two legendary

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.900 
that you have to keep two legendary
lines<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.680> both<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:56.980> them<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.580> be<00:02:57.730> massive

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
lines and both of them to be massive

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.180 
lines and both of them to be massive
lines<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.989> average<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.709> don't<00:02:59.920> know<00:02:59.980> how<00:03:00.100> much

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
lines on average I don't know how much

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.500 
lines on average I don't know how much
it<00:03:00.340> takes<00:03:00.370> 100<00:03:00.730> cubes<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:02.640> 411<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.300> Rings

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it takes 100 cubes for 411 of the Rings

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.550 
it takes 100 cubes for 411 of the Rings
I<00:03:04.750> think<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.350> one<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.770> took<00:03:06.010> me<00:03:06.190> like<00:03:06.360> 350

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
I think this one it took me like 350

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.370 
I think this one it took me like 350
so<00:03:08.520> that's<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.090> lot<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.810> would<00:03:10.080> be<00:03:10.200> much<00:03:10.319> easier

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
so that's a lot it would be much easier

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.740 
so that's a lot it would be much easier
than<00:03:10.920> lightning<00:03:11.160> kids<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.000> they<00:03:12.599> do

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
than lightning kids but they do

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.570 
than lightning kids but they do
something<00:03:13.500> totally<00:03:13.709> different<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
something totally different in the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.809 
something totally different in the
server<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:16.050> don't<00:03:16.890> use<00:03:17.069> them<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.459> cubic

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
server so you don't use them for cubic

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.250 
server so you don't use them for cubic
use<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:21.209> when<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.420> get<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:21.900> Massa

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
use and so when I get like Massa

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.229 
use and so when I get like Massa
obtained<00:03:23.010> mess<00:03:23.220> obtained<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.880> will<00:03:24.090> drop

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
obtained mess obtained and it will drop

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
obtained mess obtained and it will drop
rated<00:03:24.510> means<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.050> was<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.560> really

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
rated means that I was just really

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.440 
rated means that I was just really

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
here and you should also know that you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.180 
here and you should also know that you
can<00:03:33.810> get<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:36.000> get<00:03:36.769> four<00:03:37.769> six<00:03:38.040> seven

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
can get you can get four six seven

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.259 
can get you can get four six seven
points<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:38.849> get<00:03:39.150> IOC<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:42.030> five

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
points you can get IOC and for five

thousand dollar points finger dial see

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.490 
thousand dollar points finger dial see
the<00:03:44.430> difference<00:03:44.819> is<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.630> item<00:03:46.019> has<00:03:46.170> weapon

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
the difference is this item has weapon

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.170 
the difference is this item has weapon
attack<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:46.980> starts<00:03:47.370> but<00:03:47.580> if<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.819> get<00:03:48.000> like

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
attack and starts but if you get like

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.580 
attack and starts but if you get like
four<00:03:48.360> hundred<00:03:48.480> rebels<00:03:48.840> doesn't<00:03:49.440> really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
four hundred rebels doesn't really

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.070 
four hundred rebels doesn't really
matter<00:03:49.970> what<00:03:50.970> matters<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.330> all<00:03:51.660> sorts<00:03:51.989> of

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
matter what matters is all sorts of

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.100 
matter what matters is all sorts of
masses<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.530> things<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.069> if<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.849> had<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.720> 61

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
masses of things so if I had that 61

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.960 
masses of things so if I had that 61
upper<00:03:55.650> class<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.040> really<00:03:56.340> wouldn't<00:03:56.580> mind<00:03:56.730> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
upper class I really wouldn't mind I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.850 
upper class I really wouldn't mind I
would<00:03:57.030> still<00:03:57.360> do<00:03:57.510> max<00:03:57.720> work<00:03:57.840> shell<00:03:58.230> casing<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
would still do max work shell casing and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.400 
would still do max work shell casing and

every other skill by that except what

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.949 
every other skill by that except what

by<00:04:08.640> x<00:04:08.910> SI<00:04:09.120> hasta<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.049> gives<00:04:11.000> 25%<00:04:12.000> masses

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
by x SI hasta and it gives 25% masses

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.509 
by x SI hasta and it gives 25% masses
instead<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.840> twenty<00:04:13.170> percent<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.010> that's<00:04:14.220> ten

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
instead of twenty percent so that's ten

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.979 
instead of twenty percent so that's ten

possible<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.460> get<00:04:26.700> must<00:04:26.940> obtain<00:04:28.010> nebulae<00:04:29.010> and

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
possible you get must obtain nebulae and

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.690 
possible you get must obtain nebulae and
that's<00:04:29.820> around<00:04:30.590> 160<00:04:31.590> million<00:04:31.800> telamonian<00:04:32.310> for
