slide it down onto my wire now this here

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.600 
slide it down onto my wire now this here
it's<00:01:45.700> not<00:01:45.910> piano<00:01:46.300> wire<00:01:46.660> is<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.430> some

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it's not piano wire is it's some

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.410 
it's not piano wire is it's some
flexible<00:01:49.150> wire<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.660> came<00:01:49.870> with<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.310> motor

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
flexible wire that came with the motor

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.940 
flexible wire that came with the motor
or<00:01:52.420> one<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:52.810> my<00:01:52.900> motors<00:01:53.290> I<00:01:53.440> don't<00:01:53.620> even<00:01:53.830> know

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
or one of my motors I don't even know

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.460 
or one of my motors I don't even know
where<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.580> from<00:01:55.050> may<00:01:56.050> have<00:01:56.170> came<00:01:56.440> with

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
where I get it from may have came with

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.469 
where I get it from may have came with
the<00:01:56.770> state<00:01:57.040> on<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.400> night<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.500> then<00:01:59.650> I'm

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.480 

tighten<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.570> up<00:02:04.830> maybe<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:06.100> quarter-inch<00:02:08.490> right

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
tighten it up maybe a quarter-inch right

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.530 
tighten it up maybe a quarter-inch right
below<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.000> cow<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.650> would<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:14.920> plenty

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
below the cow and this would be plenty

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.710 
below the cow and this would be plenty
let<00:02:16.540> me<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.840> stick<00:02:17.020> my<00:02:17.230> fingers<00:02:17.620> right<00:02:17.920> under

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
let me just stick my fingers right under

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.380 
let me just stick my fingers right under
so<00:02:19.720> if<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.959> need<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.260> make<00:02:20.410> adjustment<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
so if I need to make adjustment the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.580 
so if I need to make adjustment the
ideal<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.240> everything<00:02:25.750> look<00:02:26.140> neat<00:02:26.440> as

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
ideal is to have everything look neat as

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.510 
ideal is to have everything look neat as
possible<00:02:28.170> natural<00:02:29.170> or<00:02:29.830> scale<00:02:30.250> as<00:02:30.490> possible

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
possible natural or scale as possible

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.870 
possible natural or scale as possible
all<00:02:33.520> right<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.740> then<00:02:36.100> okay<00:02:36.910> give<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.360> test

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
all right and then okay give it a test

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.650 
all right and then okay give it a test
so<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.940> get<00:02:40.269> plenty<00:02:40.920> turn<00:02:41.920> make<00:02:42.760> my<00:02:42.970> adjustment

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.479 

and<00:02:46.660> I'll<00:02:47.019> cut<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> white<00:02:47.739> I'm<00:02:48.160> gonna<00:02:48.340> leave

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
and I'll cut the white I'm gonna leave

00:02:48.489 --> 00:03:01.380 
and I'll cut the white I'm gonna leave
just<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:50.459> slack<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:59.310> all<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:00.390> that

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
just a little slack on it all right that

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.940 
just a little slack on it all right that
works

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.290 

so<00:03:05.880> there<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:08.060> needle<00:03:09.060> valve

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
so there you have it needle valve

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300 
so there you have it needle valve
adjustment<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.319> bottom<00:03:10.680> account<00:03:11.040> it's

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
adjustment on the bottom account it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.460 
adjustment on the bottom account it's
very<00:03:11.610> small

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
very small

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.440 
very small
and<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.620> won't<00:03:13.920> even<00:03:14.040> notice<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.730> when<00:03:15.420> a

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
and you won't even notice it when a

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.850 
and you won't even notice it when a
plane<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.110> ground<00:03:17.360> alright<00:03:18.360> next<00:03:18.930> prop

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
plane is on the ground alright next prop

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.240 
plane is on the ground alright next prop
I<00:03:21.830> don't<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.069> prop<00:03:23.459> ringer<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:26.069> when<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I don't have a prop ringer so when I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.949 
I don't have a prop ringer so when I
came<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.610> with<00:03:26.850> I'm<00:03:27.420> grab<00:03:27.690> my<00:03:27.870> caliper<00:03:28.440> here

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
came up with I'm grab my caliper here

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:39.070 
came up with I'm grab my caliper here
and<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:33.470> do<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.830> out<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.900> here's<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.350> caliper

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
and I do it out so this here's a caliper

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.750 
and I do it out so this here's a caliper
and<00:03:40.080> what<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.290> did<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.739> drilled<00:03:41.130> out<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.560> prop

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and what I did I drilled out the prop

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.600 
and what I did I drilled out the prop
with<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> biggest<00:03:45.299> bit<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.750> had<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.610> still

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
with the biggest bit that I had I still

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.080 
with the biggest bit that I had I still
won't<00:03:47.819> fit<00:03:49.010> all<00:03:50.010> right<00:03:50.190> won't<00:03:50.549> fit<00:03:50.790> all<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
won't fit all right won't fit all the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.900 
won't fit all right won't fit all the
way<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.420> motor<00:03:51.660> shaft<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:53.549> what<00:03:53.700> I'm<00:03:53.790> doing

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
way on the motor shaft so what I'm doing

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.520 
way on the motor shaft so what I'm doing
I<00:03:55.640> measured<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:56.730> prop<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.420> mean<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.260> motor<00:03:58.500> shaft

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
I measured a prop I mean the motor shaft

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.100 
I measured a prop I mean the motor shaft
about<00:04:01.700> 10.2<00:04:02.720> 10.3<00:04:03.720> millimeters<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:06.420> then<00:04:06.930> I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
about 10.2 10.3 millimeters and then I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.440 
about 10.2 10.3 millimeters and then I
got<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.319> bit<00:04:07.650> from<00:04:08.430> my<00:04:08.549> dream<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.940> was<00:04:09.060> actually

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
got a bit from my dream it was actually

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.199 
got a bit from my dream it was actually
a<00:04:09.480> grinding<00:04:09.989> bit<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.440> found<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.030> was

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
a grinding bit that I found and it was

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.620 
a grinding bit that I found and it was
actually<00:04:12.630> perfect<00:04:13.430> so<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.609> staff<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.209> ten

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
actually perfect so the staff is ten

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.740 
actually perfect so the staff is ten
point<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.440> one<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:18.620> grinding<00:04:19.620> bit<00:04:19.799> like

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
point to one and the grinding bit like

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:31.219 
point to one and the grinding bit like
10.25<00:04:24.740> next<00:04:25.740> what<00:04:25.890> I'm<00:04:25.979> going<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:30.229> grinding

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
10.25 next what I'm going to do grinding

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.970 
10.25 next what I'm going to do grinding
inside<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.460> prop<00:04:32.729> out

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
inside of the prop out

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.750 
inside of the prop out
what<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:34.610> it

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
what is it

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.390 
what is it
well<00:04:37.240> I'll<00:04:37.330> put<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.750> on<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.290> flat<00:04:38.680> surface<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.340> I

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
well I'll put it on a flat surface so I

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.250 
well I'll put it on a flat surface so I
can<00:04:39.580> go<00:04:39.730> straight<00:04:39.790> I<00:04:40.450> don't<00:04:40.660> want<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.870> go<00:04:40.960> crew

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
can go straight I don't want to go crew

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.900 
can go straight I don't want to go crew
get<00:04:41.410> into<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.740> FRA<00:04:41.950> so<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:42.280> won't<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:42.730> this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
get into the FRA so you won't see this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:05:19.450 
get into the FRA so you won't see this
part

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.700 

well<00:05:20.180> looks<00:05:20.510> like<00:05:20.600> they<00:05:20.930> grinding<00:05:21.350> big<00:05:21.500> guys

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
well looks like they grinding big guys

the<00:05:29.120> RPM<00:05:29.690> on<00:05:29.870> my<00:05:30.020> dremel<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.680> had<00:05:31.070> turn<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.670> had<00:05:32.060> it

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
the RPM on my dremel I had turn I had it

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.990 
the RPM on my dremel I had turn I had it
too<00:05:32.360> low<00:05:33.100> it's<00:05:34.100> better<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.490> have<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.670> prop

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
too low it's better to have a prop

00:05:35.000 --> 00:06:08.580 
too low it's better to have a prop
reamer<00:05:38.260> let<00:05:39.260> me<00:05:39.320> try<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.590> begin

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:17.190 

all<00:06:09.590> right<00:06:09.800> just<00:06:10.130> see<00:06:10.280> if<00:06:10.370> it<00:06:10.520> worked<00:06:10.700> now

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:26.790 

tough<00:06:18.200> material

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.480 

it's<00:06:27.580> just<00:06:27.819> slide<00:06:28.150> right<00:06:28.449> on<00:06:29.099> to<00:06:30.099> the<00:06:30.190> shaft

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
it's just slide right on to the shaft

00:06:30.490 --> 00:07:00.420 
it's just slide right on to the shaft
and<00:06:30.819> it<00:06:30.940> does<00:06:31.919> perfect<00:06:58.620> and<00:06:59.620> then<00:06:59.830> once<00:07:00.280> I

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
and it does perfect and then once I

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.870 
and it does perfect and then once I
tighten<00:07:00.789> it<00:07:00.849> down<00:07:00.880> that<00:07:01.270> put<00:07:01.750> the<00:07:01.900> last<00:07:02.880> note
