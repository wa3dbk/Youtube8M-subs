that's hardware on the display yes
as<00:01:23.220> well<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.700> some<00:01:23.850> timer<00:01:24.119> functions<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.720> well

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
as well as some timer functions as well

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
as well as some timer functions as well
okay<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.100> integrated<00:01:26.820> 3d

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
okay now do these have integrated 3d

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
okay now do these have integrated 3d
vision<00:01:27.740> controllers<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.950> stuff<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
vision controllers is that stuff in it I

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.090 
vision controllers is that stuff in it I
don't<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:30.380> an<00:01:31.380> adapter<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:31.950> have

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
like the external adapter for that but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.260 
like the external adapter for that but
okay<00:01:37.490> okay<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.790> also<00:01:42.060> yet
