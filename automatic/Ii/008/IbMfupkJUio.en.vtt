thing for special teams and obviously

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.959 
thing for special teams and obviously
you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.950> personalize<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you can you can personalize this and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.940 
you can you can personalize this and
make<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.119> make<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.750> own<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.649> here's<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
make it make it your own so here's the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
make it make it your own so here's the
concept<00:02:08.399> behind<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
concept behind this is that you know and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.850 
concept behind this is that you know and
I<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.989> know<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.200> saw<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.770> we

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I don't know if you saw it or not but we

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.059 
I don't know if you saw it or not but we
got<00:02:11.009> down<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.330> 180

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
got down to 180

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.989 
got down to 180
tasks<00:02:13.999> or<00:02:14.150> 180<00:02:14.659> something<00:02:15.049> tasks<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.400> that's<00:02:16.909> a

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:16.999 
tasks or 180 something tasks so that's a

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.429 
tasks or 180 something tasks so that's a
lot<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.209> stuff<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.689> done<00:02:17.719> over<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.409> course

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
lot of stuff to be done over the course

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.089 
lot of stuff to be done over the course
of<00:02:18.980> several<00:02:19.629> weeks<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:20.959> normally<00:02:21.950> there's

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
of several weeks and normally there's

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.369 
of several weeks and normally there's
about<00:02:22.249> 20<00:02:22.670> coaching<00:02:23.329> days<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:23.719> we've<00:02:23.840> got<00:02:23.989> 20

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
about 20 coaching days so we've got 20

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.739 
about 20 coaching days so we've got 20
blocks<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:26.030> what<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.269> do<00:02:26.389> is<00:02:26.420> each

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:26.749 
blocks in here and what you do is each

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.530 
blocks in here and what you do is each
night<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.290> cover<00:02:28.030> tasks<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.180> simply

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
night that you cover tasks you simply

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.879 
night that you cover tasks you simply
put<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> one<00:02:30.019> in<00:02:30.049> there<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:31.519> will<00:02:31.700> start<00:02:32.000> on

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
put a one in there and I will start on

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.679 
put a one in there and I will start on
highlighting<00:02:33.889> or<00:02:34.159> turning<00:02:34.819> these<00:02:34.939> total

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
highlighting or turning these total

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.229 
highlighting or turning these total
cells<00:02:36.230> white<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.519> means<00:02:37.730> I've<00:02:37.939> covered

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
cells white and that means I've covered

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.360 
cells white and that means I've covered
it<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.930> can<00:02:39.349> get<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.919> the<00:02:40.010> next<00:02:40.219> thing

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
it and I can get on to the next thing

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.909 
it and I can get on to the next thing
obviously<00:02:41.019> some<00:02:42.019> things<00:02:42.260> need<00:02:42.439> to<00:02:42.530> be<00:02:42.650> covered

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
obviously some things need to be covered

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.800 
obviously some things need to be covered
more<00:02:43.609> than<00:02:43.669> once<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:44.389> you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.540> kind<00:02:44.749> of

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
more than once and so you can kind of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.009 
more than once and so you can kind of
keep<00:02:44.959> up<00:02:45.169> with<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.469> but<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:47.359> game<00:02:47.540> basically

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
keep up with that but the game basically

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.349 
keep up with that but the game basically
is<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.560> try<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.859> turn<00:02:49.370> as<00:02:49.579> many<00:02:49.760> things<00:02:50.030> white

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
is to try to turn as many things white

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.390 
is to try to turn as many things white
as<00:02:50.599> possible<00:02:51.230> before<00:02:51.530> kickoff<00:02:51.889> of<00:02:51.949> the<00:02:52.129> first

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
as possible before kickoff of the first

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.699 
as possible before kickoff of the first
game<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:52.909> I've<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:53.900> found<00:02:54.199> that<00:02:54.379> this<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.680> a

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
game and I've just found that this is a

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.819 
game and I've just found that this is a
really<00:02:55.069> good<00:02:55.280> way<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:56.449> to<00:02:57.139> keep<00:02:57.319> up<00:02:57.500> with<00:02:57.650> what

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
really good way to to keep up with what

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.800 
really good way to to keep up with what
I<00:02:57.859> have<00:02:58.159> accomplished<00:02:58.730> what<00:02:58.849> I've<00:02:59.120> done<00:02:59.299> too

I have accomplished what I've done too

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.030 
I have accomplished what I've done too
much<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.409> what<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> haven't<00:03:00.799> done<00:03:00.889> enough

planning out my practice i just kind of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.860 
planning out my practice i just kind of
come<00:03:07.219> in<00:03:07.340> here<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:07.669> say<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.719> know<00:03:08.840> what

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
really very helpful in of the cheats

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.289 
really very helpful in of the cheats
here<00:03:15.590> I've<00:03:15.709> got<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.889> day<00:03:16.129> 1<00:03:16.430> day<00:03:16.639> 2<00:03:16.669> so<00:03:17.150> my

think<00:03:20.180> will<00:03:20.299> revolutionize<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.379> game<00:03:21.739> of

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
think will revolutionize the game of

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.860 
think will revolutionize the game of
football<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.519> it's<00:03:23.090> just<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.389> quick<00:03:23.599> down<00:03:23.840> and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
football but it's just a quick down and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.539 
football but it's just a quick down and
dirty<00:03:24.109> way<00:03:24.500> for<00:03:24.799> me<00:03:24.889> to<00:03:24.919> break<00:03:25.159> out<00:03:25.370> what's

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
dirty way for me to break out what's

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.069 
dirty way for me to break out what's
going<00:03:25.699> to<00:03:25.790> happen<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.180> practice<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.840> have<00:03:27.049> a

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
going to happen in practice so I have a

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.409 
going to happen in practice so I have a
warm<00:03:27.409> up<00:03:27.609> offense<00:03:28.609> if<00:03:28.939> you've<00:03:29.269> got

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
warm up offense if you've got

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.909 
warm up offense if you've got
independent<00:03:29.989> stations<00:03:30.379> or<00:03:30.470> individual

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
stations conditioning all the things

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.409 
stations conditioning all the things
that<00:03:33.259> I'm<00:03:33.409> going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.680> do<00:03:33.919> I<00:03:34.220> document<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.329> I
