 I did very simple basic marques 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 very useful in the kitchen make sure that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.189
 You'll like to go there. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 learn we're gonna need to be 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.510
 pilot satin finish on hot glue 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.509
 pet bottle can be any size 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.670
 this milk scissors and a hair clip 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.530
 a pin we'll start 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.479
 first cutting the pet bottle 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.080
 here you will cut as you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.880
 want to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.189
 no more the bottle is tiny to cut 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 here at the end of the curve, but very 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.299
 care using stylus you go 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.700
 slowly cutting you use scissors 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.070
 to correct those parts and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.009
 stay after you will report the fabric 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.170
 a little patch on the side of the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.970
 bottle that two had a little bigger 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 than this gray band in the hot glue 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.140
 I'm going to make a little stick on one side. 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 I passed the hot glue on the door 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 so here in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.600
 the other end where you will measure a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.369
 finger and pass hot glue because in this 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.990
 part for then passing the tape through 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.990
 inside then there has to be a space 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 then I'll bend his head to 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.149
 off and I'll stick that both ends 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 to come the normal side here very close to the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.870
 where it looks like the seam 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.220
 we make a snack 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.890
 the satin ribbon and then use sewing 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.830
 as a measure of the work in half and will do 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.379
 also a picote here and here we will use 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.260
 the satin ribbon you fold a little dot 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.900
 make a picote to fit white put 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.060
 hair clip here in box near the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.220
 sewing and goes through until the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.260
 first furry leaves the most you 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.950
 may be ahead only a little bit 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 behind 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.760
 I'll do the same thing to stay 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.680
 the other side where the position is now 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.470
 I'm going to use hot glue to fix this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.530
 tape behind my glue what's inside 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.420
 cut the excess and do the same thing as 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.549
 Furthermore once made this part of the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 People are going to put food on us. 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:03.120
 cut from the pet and where it was fulfilled 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.640
 people will pull to find to do 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.079
 like it's a little room to give now 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.640
 I'll hug and I'll cut the excess 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.680
 is ready 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.510
 another idea is also very cool I 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.370
 I put a piece of contact here in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.950
 up and I will use the relief ink 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.849
 to make a sketch drawing and she 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.620
 It's much simpler to see if it closes 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.930
 simple draw you need to have a 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.150
 bag for example the cookie begins 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.060
 I do not want to eat anymore so I can not pull 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 keep inside the plastic on 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 campaign and I will close in here 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.900
 points Saturday 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.010
 Then I'll open the bag on top. 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.560
 down and close cap 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.840
 now it will prevent it from pulling the wafer 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.970
 It is important to remember that this bag 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.220
 The time it gets bad is that where 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.530
 you then closes so here you always 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.790
 go and change that part you can use 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.040
 when you want 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.560
 That's it , people, this was the video today. 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.989
 very fast very easy so be quick 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.239
