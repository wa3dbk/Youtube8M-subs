00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.660
 instead of sla it is true comfort of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.380
 technician of the trapani salsa cosmi le 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.029
 I ask immediately 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.320
 oh well these are games that find the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.460
 time that they find, however, to win 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.800
 against the team in series and I guess 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 that for his locker room is a lot 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.880
 important on a mental level 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.039
 yes no you don't have to be a hypocrite in 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.439
 say that these results do not 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.269
 pleasure because I know one then 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.820
 the team asks for certain things and 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.260
 when he gets it you always belittle it 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.550
 saying that if it is a match of 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.580
 championship 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.510
 actually this is how the preseason can 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.370
 be deceitful if you don't understand 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 and the results and performance therefore me 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.879
 I'm at today 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.820
 satisfied with what the trapani has 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.340
 done but not in the results right in the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.379
 the way he faces opponents 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.510
 obviously stronger 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.190
 here is a trapani that has some verona 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.470
 nicolas arrived a few days ago 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.630
 today they were already seen with the new one 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.789
 uniform hernesto big doctor a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.619
 player I know you have strongly 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.200
 wanted trapani here tells us a 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.710
 moment the choice of both nicolas and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.020
 big tower 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.810
 well nicolas we were looking for a 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.369
 goalkeeper I knew him and verona e 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.220
 in the launch experience he already had 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.960
 proved to be more than reliable 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.720
 at the right age the right reasons for 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.240
 to be a holder and therefore to 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.470
 consequently being a protagonist 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 torregrossa a little bit now I don't want 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.930
 say a ball of mine that was a player 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.150
 which I like because it is modern as they say 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.189
 in large it is not young and return too 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.549
 he the right idea and I believe with anna 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.170
 drills a society in a serious context 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.299
 serious can do nothing but do it 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.399
 improve maybe re-propose verona in 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.490
 definitive manner is a reliable test 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.829
 for him therefore obviously his 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.270
 explosion we look forward to seeing you at 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.890
 drills that consequently that the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 cameron has absolutely seen that 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.820
 mister came drills with the formula 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.649
 of the dry loan therefore this is a 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.380
 testify that she believes the spur 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.709
 a lot of arrest is good for you 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.540
 because I repeat from what I saw 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.870
 the past year in previously a 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.739
 player who has so much but so much for 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.560
 this category 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.879
 it just needs to improve, perhaps in phase 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.340
 embodiment 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.660
 in some situations, however, I repeat drills 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.690
 not for him 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.069
 for players of that age group 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.200
 even younger 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.780
 I think it's the unreal situation 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.170
 I repeat it now serious is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.950
 city â€‹â€‹to live in a way 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.599
 positive 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.700
 however, there are no more digressions 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.190
 much and when I am there I take care of it 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.599
 here is the one inside just as you point 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.030
 I ask her about the last bar 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.590
 here's how I saw it and verona lacked tones 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 I missed so many players I ask 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.080
 this crazy tones coexistence is more 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.990
 that feasible, of course , but you want 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.950
 say I believe that with tones 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.080
 everyone can be able to 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.000
 express their qualities then 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.410
 absolutely yes today you could see that that is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.990
 that the workloads were packed 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.960
 in short, they had been remarkable 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.620
 therefore consequently start again as 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:26.390
 they did it was even more expensive 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.480
 but verona I don't have to find out I know 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.640
 but he chose a continuity management 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 technique and that I believe is already a 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.480
 great signal 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.350
 the public society I want to say is from 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.320
 another category 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.000
 indeed the series does not exist and therefore there 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.830
 are all the premises for retracing 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.190
 what verona route in these 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.190
 last years
