as<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> let's<00:01:48.720> begin

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
as well so let's begin

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.410 
as well so let's begin
let's<00:01:50.399> connect<00:01:50.880> first<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:53.119> dead<00:01:54.119> car

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
let's connect first to the dead car

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050 
let's connect first to the dead car
which<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.140> car<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.100> dead<00:01:56.340> car<00:01:56.640> battery

which is this car the dead car battery

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
which is this car the dead car battery
you<00:01:57.329> start<00:01:57.840> by<00:01:58.170> connecting<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> positive

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you start by connecting the positive

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.499 
you start by connecting the positive
cable<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> positive<00:02:01.280> terminal<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.509> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
connect it to it's going to spark and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.020 
connect it to it's going to spark and
that's<00:02:34.690> normal<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:35.680> don't<00:02:36.160> want<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.610> light

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
that's normal and we don't want to light

a<00:02:37.060> fire<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.600> our<00:02:37.630> battery<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.530> that's<00:02:38.800> the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
a fire on our battery so that's the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.980 
a fire on our battery so that's the
safest<00:02:39.430> way<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.270> that's<00:02:40.780> our

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
safest way to do it so that's our

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.710 
safest way to do it so that's our

good car and we're going to let it run
for<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.050> few<00:02:47.350> minutes<00:02:47.709> that's<00:02:48.430> going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.850> charge

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
for a few minutes that's going to charge

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.410 
for a few minutes that's going to charge
up<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.630> little<00:02:50.230> bit<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.739> battery<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:52.180> dead
