00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.890
 spider man or three days 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.260
 all overproduction around the world 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.660
 Spiderman 3 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.539
 seems to have stayed only in the segment 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.449
 in the new generation 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.480
 in the film does not do more than copy his predecessor told afp 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.890
 not worse 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 at certain times it is until Thursday 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.749
 in the skin of the spider man dared his identity 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.779
 at the end of the game 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.250
 the player for more than a decade 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 facing using 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.699
 enemies of the hero countless criminals 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.240
 the formula is the same as for magnitude 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.890
 but here the protagonist is endowed with superpowers do not have to be stealing 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 cars for hildebrand the target 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.070
 the graphics show a more populous city of the movie 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.630
 traffic jams are common on major avenues 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 only the passers-by had a minimum of intelligence 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.070
 then they keep walking 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 in Polish and intrigues fusions improvements 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.120
 mass is by far the look looks great 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.480
 with the beauty of a 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.150
 the portal 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.590
 the right way 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.290
 the construction of the buildings seems to fall short of the texas box 360 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.090
 and Playstation 3 are able to do 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.980
 at least 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
 effects of light pass this simplicity a little 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.840
 in relation to the modeling of the characters 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 there is an abyss between the spider man and the coadjuvants 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.729
 the hero's staff excellent 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.290
 he is close to the movie version 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 but the human figures gain a little bit 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.960
 many seem to have bulging eyes 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.990
 only jj seizure of the minor that is ministered disaster 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.340
 sound is just part of it 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.790
 but the soundtrack travel clinton after seeing cinemark regional 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 many of the film's 'stars' also reprise their roles in the phoenix cases 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.930
 of proof would act as spider man of the cpv of entrepreneurs like jj of emissora 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.930
 but this does not affect the exceptional result 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.400
 again the best of the team if you use the tv to walk on the removable bench 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.719
 gives a sense of freedom has a bit of what ti-ti-ti that is so 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.589
 peculiar in the cinema 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:23.439
 as you use the ugly to move from a building to a building 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.249
 ability to evolve more and more 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.880
 when you are accessing without compromise by the city 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.949
 the camera and the practice does not even bother 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:37.509
 but in racing and fighting you often can not 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.719
 Throw the target inside the screen 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.980
 it's easy to get disoriented rotate on the wall 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.089
 in the period, which makes it difficult to get where you want 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.569
 decisions and activities 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.949
 each of the vehicles represents a 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.729
 whose focus is the fight against one of the Spider-Man's arch-enemies 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.970
 the villains however of the film 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.189
 the module on living of a minority 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.259
 how much of the comics 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 Scorpio 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.069
 and then also in the cauldron 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.109
 some original figures granted to someone 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.729
 are beautiful independent stories is a beautiful forty-two missions 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.470
 sections are organized 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.789
 but in fear it gets all broken 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.699
 without a master line 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.499
 but even worse is the content of the mission 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:30.979
 the repetitive 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:36.899
 basically an alternation of combats and daily activities of a hero 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.529
 Let's save hostages. 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:43.899
 avoid catastrophes and disarm bombs the fights are to be spoken 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.059
 just choose an attack button 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.769
 and use the spider sense I ran out of military action to end most 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.299
 two opponents 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.290
 sense also serve to automatically divert attacks which 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.290
 easier to face cfz 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.699
 prolonging has necessarily done something 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.699
 in the end the fighting is benedito 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.349
 the fear costume increases the power of the area man 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.359
 can save his scenes 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.619
 the bomb disarmament buildings also did not change 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.440
 already eradication or crisis 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.860
 it's a little better 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.099
 there is also a series of hidden icons 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.960
 My heart said rewards. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.680
 spider man 3 has practically the same qualities and defects as the predecessor 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.150
 a good freedom to explore the countryside 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.580
 but with more than 100 thousand 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.700
 the problem is that the missions got less interesting 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.620
 It's better but it's not that jump. 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.979
 of generations 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.550
 in the end 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.069
 more difficult still 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.520
 already the vote 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.639
 Spider man 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.219
 who came closest 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.289
 because his father himself
