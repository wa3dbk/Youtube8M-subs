00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.790
 9 the you the 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.829
 the 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.229
 8 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.269
 yet 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.550
 my name is certainly not wrong 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.780
 old student of it is made according to our cloverleaf 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.929
 many parents and teachers who are at the door or their child to the special 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.579
 booked primary education they wonder if this is wise 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.249
 this does not work for my child's future 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.330
 PSV and a place where children can be themselves 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650
 but much attention is paid to the employee 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.960
 and where children can be optimally possible in a safe setting 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.610
 life 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.610
 but when the children receive the instruction 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.350
 know what to do but also know that he just didn't stop 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.560
 off 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.160
 then you can do it the world the children the works are welcome 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.180
 and one of them how can hear something 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 have a great time 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 I want van klink to mean that he is being addressed at his own level 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.210
 and at its own level and work 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.800
 because it can achieve top performance in the most optimal way possible 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.240
 Well all of a sudden organic for a child can mean that he is individuals 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.039
 gets attention 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.599
 and among other things focused on catching today I don't have to go to school anymore 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.960
 where she doesn't even get it anymore and school support goes there and there 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.100
 on beautiful book 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.450
 to go well it will do a nice la toya 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 they ask for an id card a gradual recovery from a cup 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.890
 below 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.930
 and you also get better stop learning and with me it's too early to finish 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.650
 I was too small did not play football 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.930
 mt nijmegen immediately surpassed the ns said trichet what do you think 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.320
 what you all and my mother at home it also very happy and surprised 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.529
 a five-year period of weaning skills applies 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.859
 4 development of the discipline does not progress 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.199
 only from a sense of the field this is not possible 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.829
 from there it can't believe it 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.859
 the things you read this count on writing in a special primary education 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.619
 just like the children in the regular primary school 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.149
 in addition to the extra attention to my weaker points I will put on my 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.149
 strong points count 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.619
 when I left special primary education, I now had a few years 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.439
 four seconds behind it on special primary education it is very important that 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.279
 children learn to read very well our goal is that most children are the 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.210
 leaving school at the highest claes level 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.520
 also given the children that there is more fun to read and we have also seen 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.660
 that children will also experience reading next to this week, I get more and more 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.419
 and hard to prevent the ns 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.069
 the rest of the year 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.389
 This message has appeared a lot 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.139
 in the fact that they can work more tailored to me with children small 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.829
 Groups of Chris Thompson who pay attention it feels the viewer non cash us 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:26.539
 people 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.519
 This is not the time for a town hall and Muslim feelings 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.189
 received from 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:39.109
 while the specialists use a wall to prevent overseas calls 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.059
 need to be renewed to find it and that could be in the much more 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.029
 offer specialized support 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.899
 50 light butterfly and the small scale and also in it 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.899
 need to connect in the short term to register 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.839
 because the small group is justified 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:07.489
 we might need some gear 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 for that matter had tapping into a different keg 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.569
 safe place with a smaller group an advertiser is offered 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.569
 in the past year 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.469
 from the other 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:30.710
 the hand work kleinpolderplein group 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.169
 and is not explained 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.439
 I just couldn't get home easily from school after it 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.490
 just put it 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.710
 and that the other school job 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.430
 thereby emerged so refined last month that they are not allowed in the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.409
 classic 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.559
 nunspeet it is no different 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:49.749
 and do that 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.969
 at least once a year for the 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.909
 pupils play being fed are still missing one 10,000 among others one 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.060
 internal supervisor 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.889
 work socially shortly before the fall 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.809
 Thursday 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.769
 that confirms having been abroad and not as on behalf of the management as 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:07.960
 chairman 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.389
 where everyone has their own input 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.520
 and in it 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.520
 but we look at what education will see 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.409
 at take all 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.039
 expertly together 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.710
 and create a profile of the child 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.190
 and therefore go to work look the debate this child needs in this education win 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.860
 situation you can do these things 8 to make the students naturally specific 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.060
 educational needs just like a primary school has a special 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.550
 primary education as a goal 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.550
 optimally prepare a child for further education 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.050
 it worked well for me 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.610
 I have a great connection 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.400
 The only thing that stood out is that I am much farther away from me 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.819
 classmates 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.700
 the fifth time 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.150
 and got stuck for whatever reason 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.129
 can help further 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:57.060
 this process 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.919
 do not worry 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.850
 well that much office day often 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.659
 finish it 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.589
 very nice and varied for eleven lives 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.680
 we are simply required to do that 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.599
 to get attention 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:09.879
 not in one in one 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.190
 If you see how I can do it is not the motto 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.680
 happy learning together 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.789
 you can only learn from it 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.060
 if you feel good the selling rights of the squash create a nice atmosphere 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.059
 we roberts together the boys are against the girls 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.580
 only a few camp 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.580
 great weather

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:56.429
