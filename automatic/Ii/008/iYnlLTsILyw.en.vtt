00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
I started to get a little nervous for

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.330 
I started to get a little nervous for
Marvel<00:01:17.840> because<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:18.560> think<00:01:18.799> when<00:01:18.920> they<00:01:19.040> first

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
Marvel because I think when they first

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.039 
Marvel because I think when they first
picked<00:01:19.610> Ultron<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.360> there<00:01:20.509> villain<00:01:20.840> for<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049

picked Ultron is there villain for the
Avengers<00:01:21.470> 2<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.009> was<00:01:22.399> with<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.759> hope<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.240> assume

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
Avengers 2 it was with the hope I assume

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.090 
Avengers 2 it was with the hope I assume
that<00:01:24.140> they<00:01:24.229> could<00:01:24.409> introduce<00:01:24.619> something<00:01:24.950> new

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100

to<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.720> great<00:01:33.049> extent<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:33.590> comics<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:34.789> know

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
to a great extent in comics and you know

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.059 
to a great extent in comics and you know
genre<00:01:35.600> material<00:01:36.110> but<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:36.679> terms<00:01:36.920> of

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
genre material but in terms of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.430 
genre material but in terms of
mainstream<00:01:37.550> movies<00:01:37.909> not<00:01:38.420> quite<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:38.929> much<00:01:39.170> it's

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
mainstream movies not quite so much it's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.469 
mainstream movies not quite so much it's
kind<00:01:39.619> of<00:01:39.679> new<00:01:39.860> territory<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.000> think<00:01:41.149> that

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
kind of new territory so I think that

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.270 
kind of new territory so I think that
with<00:01:41.630> Ultron<00:01:42.049> Marvel<00:01:42.500> was<00:01:42.619> hoping<00:01:42.950> hey<00:01:43.069> we

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
with Ultron Marvel was hoping hey we

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.550 
with Ultron Marvel was hoping hey we
have<00:01:43.399> Skynet<00:01:43.909> here<00:01:44.149> but<00:01:44.539> with<00:01:44.690> a<00:01:44.720> personality

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
have Skynet here but with a personality

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.529 
have Skynet here but with a personality
however<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.460> looks<00:01:46.580> like<00:01:46.789> Christopher<00:01:47.240> Nolan

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
however it looks like Christopher Nolan

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.149 
however it looks like Christopher Nolan
has<00:01:47.690> beaten<00:01:48.049> them<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.679> punch<00:01:48.920> because

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
has beaten them to the punch because

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.370 
has beaten them to the punch because
he's<00:01:49.369> producing<00:01:49.819> transcendence<00:01:50.509> which<00:01:51.229> is

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
he's producing transcendence which is

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.410 
he's producing transcendence which is
the<00:01:51.530> directorial<00:01:52.000> debut<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.119> his<00:01:53.240> longtime

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the directorial debut of his longtime

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.809 
the directorial debut of his longtime
cinematographer<00:01:54.409> Wally<00:01:54.619> Pfister<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.369> I

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
cinematographer Wally Pfister and I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.639 
cinematographer Wally Pfister and I
think<00:01:55.880> what<00:01:56.149> they<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.600> looks<00:01:56.840> really

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
think what they have here looks really

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.219 
think what they have here looks really
compelling<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:59.030> also<00:01:59.270> take<00:01:59.479> James<00:01:59.899> fader

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
compelling and also take James fader

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.649 
compelling and also take James fader
everyone<00:02:00.770> was<00:02:00.920> actually<00:02:01.909> everyone<00:02:02.360> was<00:02:02.479> only

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
everyone was actually everyone was only

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.359 
everyone was actually everyone was only
semi<00:02:02.929> excited<00:02:03.470> about<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.799> casting<00:02:04.280> it

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
semi excited about that casting it

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.499 
semi excited about that casting it
didn't<00:02:04.520> really<00:02:04.640> light<00:02:04.940> up<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.149> internet<00:02:05.479> I

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
didn't really light up the internet I

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
didn't really light up the internet I
think<00:02:05.780> probably<00:02:06.289> as<00:02:06.530> Marvel<00:02:06.799> Studios<00:02:06.950> would

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
think probably as Marvel Studios would

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.219 
think probably as Marvel Studios would
have<00:02:07.430> hoped<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.850> mean<00:02:08.179> Paul<00:02:08.509> rodas<00:02:08.780> ant-man<00:02:09.109> is

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
have hoped I mean Paul rodas ant-man is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.530 
have hoped I mean Paul rodas ant-man is
getting<00:02:09.619> more<00:02:09.769> attention<00:02:09.859> and<00:02:10.429> now<00:02:11.150> James

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
getting more attention and now James

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.630 
getting more attention and now James

Spader who I love on the blacklist by

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.699 
Spader who I love on the blacklist by
the<00:02:13.700> way<00:02:13.940> has<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.660> go<00:02:14.750> up<00:02:14.780> against<00:02:15.260> Johnny
