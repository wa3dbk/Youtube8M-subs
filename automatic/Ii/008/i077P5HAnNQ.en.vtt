00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.929 
sit the neck down on the trash can and
sprayed<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.379> with<00:03:32.409> glaze<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:33.159> stuff<00:03:33.400> and

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
sprayed it with glaze this stuff and

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.349 
sprayed it with glaze this stuff and
it's<00:03:34.900> all<00:03:35.079> sitting<00:03:35.470> very<00:03:35.890> well<00:03:36.299> here's<00:03:37.299> the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
it's all sitting very well here's the

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.099 
it's all sitting very well here's the
neck<00:03:37.659> right<00:03:38.140> inside<00:03:38.470> my<00:03:38.650> door<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.840> next

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
neck right inside my door and the next

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.229 
neck right inside my door and the next
waiting<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.590> get<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.829> second<00:03:42.250> or<00:03:42.370> second<00:03:43.030> coat

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
waiting to get it second or second coat

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.699 
waiting to get it second or second coat
I'm<00:03:43.420> going<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.599> do<00:03:43.689> about<00:03:43.780> four<00:03:44.140> or<00:03:44.170> five<00:03:44.290> coats

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
I'm going to do about four or five coats

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.770 
I'm going to do about four or five coats
on<00:03:44.950> this<00:03:45.159> this<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.269> different<00:03:46.599> than<00:03:46.689> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
on this this is different than the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.660 
on this this is different than the
holographic<00:03:47.260> flake<00:03:47.650> guitar<00:03:48.010> because<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
holographic flake guitar because the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.849 
holographic flake guitar because the
holographic<00:03:49.120> flake<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.409> stack<00:03:50.650> up

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
holographic flake you have to stack up

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.240 
holographic flake you have to stack up
it<00:03:51.549> seems<00:03:51.849> like<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.450> flake<00:03:52.690> that's<00:03:52.959> in<00:03:53.109> a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
it seems like the the flake that's in a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.849 
it seems like the the flake that's in a
custom<00:03:54.250> paint<00:03:54.489> job<00:03:54.670> like<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:54.819> absorbs<00:03:55.389> the

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
custom paint job like that absorbs the

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.379 
custom paint job like that absorbs the
the<00:03:56.859> clear<00:03:57.129> coat<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.609> pulls<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.120> leaves

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
the clear coat and it pulls it in leaves

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.960 
the clear coat and it pulls it in leaves
dense<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:59.379> stuff<00:03:59.650> really<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.370> just<00:04:00.609> stacking

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
dense this stuff really is just stacking

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.940 
dense this stuff really is just stacking
up<00:04:01.269> on<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.599> it's<00:04:01.750> not<00:04:01.959> really<00:04:02.290> like<00:04:02.319> taking

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
up on it it's not really like taking

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.390 
up on it it's not really like taking
form<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.579> stripe<00:04:04.389> lines<00:04:04.720> are<00:04:04.989> in<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.170> nao

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
form of the stripe lines are in the nao

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.149 
form of the stripe lines are in the nao
there's<00:04:06.400> no<00:04:06.579> it's<00:04:06.970> all<00:04:07.120> seamless<00:04:07.569> there's<00:04:07.780> no

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
there's no it's all seamless there's no

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.470 
there's no it's all seamless there's no
like<00:04:09.159> I<00:04:09.280> noticed<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:09.730> automotive<00:04:10.090> flakes

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
like I noticed with automotive flakes

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.270 
like I noticed with automotive flakes
they<00:04:10.720> tend<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.349> suck<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.859> its<00:04:12.069> own<00:04:12.159> little

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
they tend to suck in its own little

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.099 
they tend to suck in its own little
creator<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.849> moisture<00:04:13.389> because<00:04:13.599> it's<00:04:13.750> pulling

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
creator of moisture because it's pulling

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.099 
creator of moisture because it's pulling
in<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.500> clear<00:04:15.430> coat<00:04:15.609> so<00:04:15.879> I'm<00:04:16.750> going<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.959> take

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
in the clear coat so I'm going to take

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.580 
in the clear coat so I'm going to take
this<00:04:17.289> bad<00:04:17.560> boy<00:04:17.769> out<00:04:18.299> outside<00:04:19.299> again<00:04:19.959> looks

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
this bad boy out outside again looks

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.529 
this bad boy out outside again looks
like<00:04:20.709> it's<00:04:20.859> drawing<00:04:21.130> I'm<00:04:22.030> going<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.270> do<00:04:22.389> this

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
like it's drawing I'm going to do this

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.339 
like it's drawing I'm going to do this
every<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:24.030> don't<00:04:25.030> know<00:04:25.090> every<00:04:25.330> 10<00:04:25.570> minutes<00:04:25.780> 12

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
every I don't know every 10 minutes 12

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.490 
every I don't know every 10 minutes 12
minutes<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:27.460> enough<00:04:27.789> for<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.090> lose<00:04:28.360> its

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
minutes just enough for it to lose its

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.770 
minutes just enough for it to lose its
slight<00:04:29.500> moisture<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.310> can<00:04:30.550> tell<00:04:30.760> i'm<00:04:31.660> going

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
slight moisture you can tell i'm going

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.390 
slight moisture you can tell i'm going
to<00:04:31.840> bring<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.139> outside<00:04:32.260> put<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:32.979> on<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.159> trash

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
to bring it outside put it on the trash

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.439 
to bring it outside put it on the trash
can<00:04:33.669> write<00:04:34.360> down<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:36.030> i'm<00:04:37.030> going<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.270> hit<00:04:37.389> it

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
can write down and i'm going to hit it

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.500 
can write down and i'm going to hit it
again<00:04:38.010> basically<00:04:39.010> i<00:04:39.039> mean<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:39.460> stuff<00:04:39.729> really

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
again basically i mean this stuff really

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.659 
again basically i mean this stuff really
isn't<00:04:40.900> bad<00:04:41.020> also<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.349> tip<00:04:41.620> for<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:41.919> disc<00:04:42.310> glaze

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
isn't bad also a tip for this disc glaze

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.129 
isn't bad also a tip for this disc glaze
is<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.380> have<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.590> hit<00:04:44.889> it<00:04:44.949> like<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.139> you

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
is that you have to hit it like it you

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.330 
is that you have to hit it like it you
would<00:04:47.289> think<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.620> use<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.860> like<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:48.010> paint

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
would think to use it like a paint

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.370 
would think to use it like a paint
sprayer<00:04:48.669> but<00:04:48.909> when<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.150> do<00:04:49.360> you'll<00:04:49.840> get<00:04:50.050> runs

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
sprayer but when you do you'll get runs

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.240 
sprayer but when you do you'll get runs
or<00:04:51.130> overspray<00:04:51.880> that<00:04:52.120> kind<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.889> dampens<00:04:53.889> it<00:04:54.039> so

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
or overspray that kind of dampens it so

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.430 
or overspray that kind of dampens it so
what<00:04:54.490> i<00:04:54.520> would<00:04:54.760> do<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.180> probably<00:04:55.900> do<00:04:56.289> the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
what i would do is probably do the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.379 
what i would do is probably do the
checkerboard<00:04:57.039> pattern<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.580> crosses<00:04:58.060> all<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
checkerboard pattern and crosses all the

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.420 
checkerboard pattern and crosses all the
glaze<00:04:58.659> cross<00:04:58.990> command<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.990> know<00:05:02.110> anyways<00:05:02.979> I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
glaze cross command you know anyways I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.950 
glaze cross command you know anyways I
think<00:05:03.729> it's<00:05:03.849> too<00:05:03.970> difficult<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.479> shoot<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.870> and

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
think it's too difficult to shoot it and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.450 
think it's too difficult to shoot it and
hold<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.199> camera<00:05:05.440> basically<00:05:05.740> i'm<00:05:06.130> going<00:05:06.400> to

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
hold the camera basically i'm going to

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.959 
hold the camera basically i'm going to
go

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
go

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.329 
go
kind<00:05:07.479> of<00:05:07.569> start<00:05:07.809> from<00:05:07.929> here<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:08.739> I'm<00:05:09.159> going<00:05:09.249> to

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:09.339 
kind of start from here and I'm going to

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.429 
kind of start from here and I'm going to
stripe<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.789> all<00:05:09.879> the<00:05:09.969> way<00:05:10.089> up<00:05:10.329> and<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.989> have<00:05:11.229> it

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439 
stripe it all the way up and I have it

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.589 
stripe it all the way up and I have it
specifically<00:05:12.279> I<00:05:12.399> learned<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:12.759> already<00:05:12.939> you

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
specifically I learned this already you

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.149 
specifically I learned this already you
have<00:05:13.779> to<00:05:13.959> set<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.199> fretboard<00:05:14.529> like<00:05:14.889> this

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
have to set the fretboard like this

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.249 
have to set the fretboard like this
because<00:05:15.879> you<00:05:16.179> want<00:05:16.299> the<00:05:16.479> glaze<00:05:16.779> to<00:05:17.049> just

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
because you want the glaze to just

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.589 
because you want the glaze to just
settle<00:05:17.529> up<00:05:18.159> here<00:05:18.549> on<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.759> top<00:05:18.789> you<00:05:19.029> don't<00:05:19.209> want

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599
