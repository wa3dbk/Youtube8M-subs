00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.459 

so<00:00:09.760> I<00:00:09.790> just<00:00:10.030> turned<00:00:10.300> a<00:00:10.480> part<00:00:10.990> on<00:00:11.139> the<00:00:11.290> lathe

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
so I just turned a part on the lathe

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.949 
so I just turned a part on the lathe
turned<00:00:11.980> a<00:00:12.070> diameter<00:00:12.670> and<00:00:12.940> face<00:00:13.389> the<00:00:13.600> end<00:00:13.719> of<00:00:13.840> it

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
turned a diameter and face the end of it

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.650 
turned a diameter and face the end of it
off<00:00:14.110> I<00:00:14.410> would<00:00:14.980> like<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.190> go<00:00:15.309> ahead<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:15.790> turn<00:00:16.600> a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
off I would like to go ahead and turn a

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.570 
off I would like to go ahead and turn a
radius<00:00:17.140> on<00:00:17.410> this<00:00:17.590> corner<00:00:18.070> and<00:00:18.189> I<00:00:18.279> like<00:00:18.369> to<00:00:18.460> get

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
radius on this corner and I like to get

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.510 
radius on this corner and I like to get
rid<00:00:18.700> of<00:00:18.790> this<00:00:18.880> sharp<00:00:19.180> corner<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:19.720> maybe<00:00:19.869> put<00:00:20.140> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
rid of this sharp corner and maybe put a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.130 
rid of this sharp corner and maybe put a
3/16<00:00:21.520> radius<00:00:21.970> on<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.240> how<00:00:22.810> do<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:22.990> go<00:00:23.110> about

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
3/16 radius on it how do I go about

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.060 
3/16 radius on it how do I go about
doing<00:00:23.680> that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
doing that

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.150 
doing that
well<00:00:24.759> the<00:00:24.849> most<00:00:25.000> common<00:00:25.090> way<00:00:25.570> of<00:00:25.950> turning<00:00:26.950> a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
well the most common way of turning a

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.010 
well the most common way of turning a
radius<00:00:27.550> on<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.880> way<00:00:28.000> this<00:00:28.239> is<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.630> grind<00:00:28.899> a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
radius on the way this is to grind a

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.229 
radius on the way this is to grind a
form<00:00:29.290> tool<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.980> proper<00:00:30.399> radius<00:00:30.790> and<00:00:31.090> just

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
form tool the proper radius and just

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.310 
form tool the proper radius and just
plunge<00:00:31.540> the<00:00:31.750> form<00:00:31.960> tool<00:00:32.169> into<00:00:32.500> your<00:00:32.619> park<00:00:33.270> well

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
plunge the form tool into your park well

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.810 
plunge the form tool into your park well
here's<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.410> couple<00:00:35.620> here's<00:00:35.829> a<00:00:35.860> few<00:00:36.100> form<00:00:36.520> tools

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
here's a couple here's a few form tools

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.459 
here's a couple here's a few form tools
here<00:00:37.059> I've<00:00:37.210> ground<00:00:37.510> over<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.899> years<00:00:38.050> various

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
here I've ground over the years various

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.549 
here I've ground over the years various
radii<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:42.179> discussed<00:00:43.179> making<00:00:43.719> form<00:00:44.170> tools<00:00:44.410> a

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
radii I discussed making form tools a

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.489 
radii I discussed making form tools a
little<00:00:44.800> bit<00:00:44.920> in<00:00:45.100> my<00:00:45.309> thread<00:00:45.910> cutting<00:00:46.179> video<00:00:47.170> on

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:47.499 
little bit in my thread cutting video on

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:48.869 
little bit in my thread cutting video on
how<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.710> grind<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.070> threading<00:00:48.399> tool<00:00:48.609> I

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
how to grind a threading tool I

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.970 
how to grind a threading tool I
mentioned<00:00:49.839> that<00:00:49.929> a<00:00:49.989> threading<00:00:50.589> tool<00:00:50.769> is<00:00:50.890> a

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
mentioned that a threading tool is a

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.889 
mentioned that a threading tool is a
form<00:00:51.249> tool<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:52.210> talked<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.600> little<00:00:52.719> bit

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
form tool and I talked a little bit

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.869 
form tool and I talked a little bit
about<00:00:53.050> grinding<00:00:53.440> one<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.949> that<00:00:54.460> video

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
about grinding one in that video

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.959 
about grinding one in that video
basically<00:00:55.839> it's<00:00:56.109> form<00:00:56.769> tool<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.219> if<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.789> look

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
basically it's form tool is if you look

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.669 
basically it's form tool is if you look
at<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.269> straight<00:00:58.539> down<00:00:58.719> from<00:00:58.929> the<00:00:59.050> top<00:00:59.289> you<00:00:59.530> can

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
at it straight down from the top you can

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.559 
at it straight down from the top you can
see<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.280> form<00:01:00.519> you<00:01:00.670> want<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.940> cut<00:01:01.120> ground

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
see the the form you want to cut ground

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.950 
see the the form you want to cut ground
into<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.050> tool<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:03.089> the<00:01:04.089> top<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.449> tool<00:01:04.659> is

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
into the tool and the top of the tool is

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.410 
into the tool and the top of the tool is
flat<00:01:05.620> form<00:01:06.310> tools<00:01:06.550> meant<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.909> be<00:01:07.000> used<00:01:07.180> in<00:01:07.330> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
flat form tools meant to be used in a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.530 
flat form tools meant to be used in a
horizontal<00:01:07.770> orientation<00:01:09.300> so<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.390> see

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
horizontal orientation so you see

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.120 
horizontal orientation so you see
there's<00:01:10.720> no<00:01:10.870> back<00:01:11.170> rake<00:01:11.500> on<00:01:11.710> they<00:01:11.830> need<00:01:12.010> these

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
there's no back rake on they need these

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.360 
there's no back rake on they need these
tools<00:01:12.460> they're<00:01:12.670> just<00:01:12.820> flat<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.450> top<00:01:14.370> but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
tools they're just flat on the top but

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.950 
tools they're just flat on the top but
there's<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.910> lot<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.210> work<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.390> goes<00:01:16.690> into

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
there's a lot of work that goes into

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.380 
there's a lot of work that goes into
making<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.350> tool<00:01:17.530> like<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:17.980> this<00:01:18.400> one<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.120> kind

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
making a tool like this this one I kind

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.090 
making a tool like this this one I kind
of<00:01:19.450> cheated<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:19.900> used<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.170> surface<00:01:20.530> grinder<00:01:20.620> on

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
of cheated I used a surface grinder on

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.370 
of cheated I used a surface grinder on
it<00:01:21.280> but<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:22.420> can<00:01:22.450> make<00:01:22.690> them<00:01:22.810> by<00:01:22.990> hand<00:01:23.230> just

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
it but you can make them by hand just

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.400 
it but you can make them by hand just
get<00:01:23.740> your<00:01:23.860> radius<00:01:24.220> gages<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:26.110> go<00:01:26.290> to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
get your radius gages and just go to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.930 
get your radius gages and just go to
work<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.740> them<00:01:26.860> with<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.980> pedestal<00:01:27.310> grinder<00:01:27.790> do

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
work on them with a pedestal grinder do

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.450 
work on them with a pedestal grinder do
a<00:01:28.090> little<00:01:28.600> little<00:01:29.110> care<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.500> can<00:01:29.680> end<00:01:30.280> up<00:01:30.400> with

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
a little little care you can end up with

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.400 
a little little care you can end up with
a<00:01:30.610> pretty<00:01:30.820> nice<00:01:31.150> looking<00:01:31.390> form<00:01:31.780> tool<00:01:32.020> but<00:01:32.290> it's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
a pretty nice looking form tool but it's

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.950 
a pretty nice looking form tool but it's
a<00:01:32.470> lot<00:01:32.620> of<00:01:32.650> work<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.300> an<00:01:34.510> easier<00:01:34.810> way<00:01:34.930> to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
a lot of work there is an easier way to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.550 
a lot of work there is an easier way to
do<00:01:35.230> it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
do it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.400 
do it
I<00:01:35.700> made<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.730> couple<00:01:37.060> videos<00:01:37.270> back<00:01:37.480> I<00:01:37.990> made<00:01:38.380> a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
I made a couple videos back I made a

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.530 
I made a couple videos back I made a
video<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.830> how<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.280> use<00:01:39.430> corner<00:01:40.000> rounding<00:01:40.360> end

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
video on how to use corner rounding end

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.680 
video on how to use corner rounding end
mills<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.130> video<00:01:42.280> I<00:01:42.550> mentioned<00:01:43.060> that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
mills and in that video I mentioned that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.530 
mills and in that video I mentioned that
a<00:01:44.080> corner<00:01:45.070> rounding<00:01:45.370> end<00:01:45.550> mill<00:01:45.760> can<00:01:46.060> also<00:01:46.210> be

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
a corner rounding end mill can also be

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.390 
a corner rounding end mill can also be
used<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.620> form<00:01:47.980> tool<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.600> way<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.400> I've

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
used as a form tool on the way and I've

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.840 
used as a form tool on the way and I've
had<00:01:51.580> several<00:01:51.970> requests<00:01:52.930> since<00:01:53.350> then<00:01:53.850> asking

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
had several requests since then asking

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.390 
had several requests since then asking
how<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.510> do<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.530> thought<00:01:57.160> I'd<00:01:57.280> just

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
how you do that so I thought I'd just

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.950 
how you do that so I thought I'd just
throw<00:01:57.700> together<00:01:57.760> this<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.390> quick<00:01:58.600> video<00:01:58.900> here

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
throw together this a quick video here

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.350 
throw together this a quick video here
tonight<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.880> give<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> little<00:02:01.150> demonstration

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
tonight to give a little demonstration

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600 
tonight to give a little demonstration
on<00:02:01.900> how<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.050> use<00:02:02.260> a<00:02:02.290> corner<00:02:02.920> rounding<00:02:03.250> end<00:02:03.400> mill

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
on how to use a corner rounding end mill

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.090 
on how to use a corner rounding end mill
in<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.420> way

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.919 

well<00:02:08.100> if<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.819> look<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.300> corner<00:02:09.630> rounding

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
well if you look at a corner rounding

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.540 
well if you look at a corner rounding
endmill<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.310> form

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
endmill you can see it's it's a form

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.309 
endmill you can see it's it's a form
tool<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> lathes<00:02:12.569> tools<00:02:12.900> except

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
tool just like the lathes tools except

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.050 
tool just like the lathes tools except
there's<00:02:13.530> four<00:02:13.800> flutes<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.490> case<00:02:14.730> instead

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
there's four flutes in this case instead

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.660 
there's four flutes in this case instead
of<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> case<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.580> an

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
of just the one and in the case of an

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.020 
of just the one and in the case of an
end<00:02:17.819> mill<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.550> cutter<00:02:20.790> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
end mill it's the the cutter that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.420 
end mill it's the the cutter that
rotates<00:02:21.510> against<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> stationary<00:02:23.010> piece<00:02:23.220> of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
rotates against the stationary piece of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.610 
rotates against the stationary piece of
work<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.720> way<00:02:24.989> that's<00:02:25.319> just<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
work and on the way that's just the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.530 
work and on the way that's just the
opposite<00:02:26.069> right<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> cutter<00:02:26.550> stationary<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
opposite right the cutter stationary and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.120 
opposite right the cutter stationary and
the<00:02:28.020> work<00:02:28.170> rotates<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.780> use

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
the work rotates so we just we can use

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.070 
the work rotates so we just we can use
we<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.520> use<00:02:32.700> pick<00:02:33.000> one<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.330> these<00:02:33.420> flutes

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
we can just use pick one of these flutes

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.949 
we can just use pick one of these flutes
on<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.410> corner<00:02:34.709> rounding<00:02:35.010> end<00:02:35.190> mill<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.630> put

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
on the corner rounding end mill and put

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.120 
on the corner rounding end mill and put
it<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.200> our<00:02:37.319> tool<00:02:37.770> post<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.650> use<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.860> as

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it in our tool post and just use it as

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.170 
it in our tool post and just use it as
as<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.760> form<00:02:42.120> cutter

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.880 

these<00:02:46.540> cutters<00:02:46.780> work<00:02:47.050> best<00:02:47.319> with<00:02:47.830> a

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
these cutters work best with a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.130 
these cutters work best with a

horizontal plane it can't be it can't be
tipped<00:03:21.370> back<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.940> can't<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.330> above<00:03:22.630> or<00:03:22.930> below

the centerline of the work has to be on
center<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:25.900> horizontal<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.370> if<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.060> use<00:03:28.209> a

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
center and horizontal so if you use a

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.759 
center and horizontal so if you use a
post<00:03:28.840> like<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.410> have<00:03:29.530> you're<00:03:29.709> gonna

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
post like this you have you're gonna

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.000 
post like this you have you're gonna
have<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.040> shim<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.280> up<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:31.269> get<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.510> high<00:03:31.660> enough

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
have to shim it up to get it high enough

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.920 
have to shim it up to get it high enough
so<00:03:33.010> these<00:03:33.190> guys<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.880> quick<00:03:34.060> change<00:03:34.269> posts<00:03:34.840> are

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
so these guys the quick change posts are

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.210 
so these guys the quick change posts are
much<00:03:35.079> easier<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.650> use<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:37.180> type<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> work

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
much easier to use for this type of work

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.160 
much easier to use for this type of work
so<00:03:39.220> basically<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:39.760> put<00:03:40.180> your<00:03:40.360> your<00:03:40.720> tool<00:03:40.989> in

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
so basically just put your your tool in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.069 
so basically just put your your tool in
your<00:03:41.200> cutter<00:03:42.099> into<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.299> kind<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:43.720> rotate

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
your cutter into it and kind of rotate

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.770 
your cutter into it and kind of rotate
it<00:03:44.230> till<00:03:44.440> it's<00:03:44.819> horizontal<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:47.549> also<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:48.819> don't

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
it till it's horizontal and also I don't

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.509 
it till it's horizontal and also I don't
with<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.260> thing<00:03:50.440> about<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.709> form<00:03:51.040> cutter<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
with the thing about a form cutter is

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.309 
with the thing about a form cutter is
there's<00:03:52.060> always<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.329> lot<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.900> cutter<00:03:53.109> in

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
there's always a lot of the cutter in

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.069 
there's always a lot of the cutter in
contact<00:03:53.799> with<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.100> work<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.209> possibility

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
contact with the work so the possibility

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.750 
contact with the work so the possibility
of<00:03:56.109> chatter<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.739> pretty<00:03:56.980> high<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.549> keep

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
of chatter is pretty high so keep

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.860 
of chatter is pretty high so keep
everything<00:03:58.060> up<00:03:59.019> tight<00:03:59.470> close<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.870> reduce

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
everything up tight close to the reduce

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.509 
everything up tight close to the reduce
overhang<00:04:02.380> as<00:04:02.590> much<00:04:02.889> as<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.130> can<00:04:03.340> keep

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
overhang as much as you can keep

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.360 
overhang as much as you can keep
everything<00:04:03.609> up<00:04:03.970> close<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:04.480> tool<00:04:04.690> post

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
everything up close to the tool post

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.979 
everything up close to the tool post
so<00:04:07.030> let's<00:04:07.209> go<00:04:07.330> ahead<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.510> tighten<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:07.930> thing

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
so let's go ahead and tighten this thing

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.030 
so let's go ahead and tighten this thing

or make sure it's vertically it's on the
center<00:04:27.770> of<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.950> park<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.930> can<00:04:30.080> see<00:04:30.380> that

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
center of the park if you can see that

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.290 
center of the park if you can see that
we're<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.280> little<00:04:31.370> bit<00:04:31.610> low<00:04:31.820> right<00:04:32.120> now<00:04:32.150> so

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
we're a little bit low right now so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.640 
we're a little bit low right now so
let's<00:04:32.720> bring<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.110> up<00:04:35.080> I'm<00:04:36.080> looking<00:04:36.380> at<00:04:36.500> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
let's bring it up I'm looking at the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.800 
let's bring it up I'm looking at the
mark<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.550> center<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.000> part<00:04:38.240> against

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
mark in the center of the part against

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.230 
mark in the center of the part against
the<00:04:38.960> top<00:04:39.410> edge<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.550> tool<00:04:40.730> over<00:04:40.970> the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the top edge of the of the tool over the

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.810 
the top edge of the of the tool over the
float<00:04:41.540> we're<00:04:41.780> using<00:04:41.960> on<00:04:42.230> the<00:04:42.320> tool<00:04:42.669> all<00:04:43.669> right

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
float we're using on the tool all right

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.870 
float we're using on the tool all right
so<00:04:44.030> we're<00:04:44.830> we're<00:04:45.830> set<00:04:46.070> up<00:04:46.190> or<00:04:46.310> their<00:04:46.460> tool<00:04:46.640> bit

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
so we're we're set up or their tool bit

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.909 
so we're we're set up or their tool bit
now<00:04:47.419> it's<00:04:47.630> pretty<00:04:47.840> much<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.230> same<00:04:48.260> as<00:04:48.650> on<00:04:48.800> the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
now it's pretty much the same as on the

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.700 
now it's pretty much the same as on the
milling<00:04:49.190> machine<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:50.060> have<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.300> pick<00:04:50.510> up<00:04:50.710> we

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
milling machine we have to pick up we

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.940 
milling machine we have to pick up we
have<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.980> align<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.490> tool<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:52.940> work<00:04:53.950> so

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
have to align the tool to the work so

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.300 
have to align the tool to the work so
let's<00:04:55.100> go<00:04:55.280> ahead<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.490> do<00:04:55.730> that<00:04:57.160> let's<00:04:58.160> turn

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
let's go ahead and do that let's turn

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.110 
let's go ahead and do that let's turn
your<00:04:58.490> spindle<00:04:58.790> on<00:04:59.090> and<00:05:00.020> let's<00:05:00.320> start<00:05:00.590> out

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.640 

by

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.820 

lining<00:05:12.520> up<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.910> tool<00:05:13.630> longitudinally<00:05:14.500> in<00:05:14.650> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
lining up the tool longitudinally in the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.179 
lining up the tool longitudinally in the
x-axis<00:05:15.460> I<00:05:15.669> guess<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:16.210> would<00:05:16.330> call<00:05:16.360> it

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.100 

it<00:05:20.669> is<00:05:20.819> run<00:05:21.059> the<00:05:21.149> tool<00:05:21.330> up<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.659> the<00:05:21.779> end<00:05:21.929> of<00:05:22.050> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
it is run the tool up to the end of the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.519 
it is run the tool up to the end of the
part<00:05:22.349> until<00:05:22.619> it<00:05:22.739> just<00:05:22.919> touches<00:05:23.419> like<00:05:24.419> that<00:05:24.529> and

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
part until it just touches like that and

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.109 
part until it just touches like that and
we'll<00:05:25.679> set<00:05:25.889> our<00:05:25.979> carriage<00:05:26.309> stop<00:05:28.879> these<00:05:29.879> easy

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:30.119 
we'll set our carriage stop these easy

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:31.969 
we'll set our carriage stop these easy
to<00:05:30.269> use<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.419> hard<00:05:30.689> carriage<00:05:31.050> stop<00:05:31.319> or<00:05:31.649> an

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
to use a hard carriage stop or an

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.689 
to use a hard carriage stop or an
indicator<00:05:32.610> stop<00:05:32.939> like<00:05:33.179> this<00:05:34.309> good<00:05:35.309> I<00:05:35.429> can<00:05:35.580> do

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
indicator stop like this good I can do

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.860 
indicator stop like this good I can do
this<00:05:35.849> with<00:05:36.059> one<00:05:36.239> hand

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.200 

so<00:05:40.350> dial<00:05:40.710> eight<00:05:40.919> into<00:05:41.250> zero<00:05:41.490> that's<00:05:42.000> going<00:05:42.150> to

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
so dial eight into zero that's going to

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.050 
so dial eight into zero that's going to
be<00:05:42.330> what<00:05:42.480> we're<00:05:42.660> once<00:05:43.620> we<00:05:43.770> this<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.730> area<00:05:45.030> I

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
be what we're once we this is the area I

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.750 
be what we're once we this is the area I
definitely<00:05:45.630> feed<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.930> tool<00:05:46.139> in<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:47.550> we<00:05:47.669> know

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
definitely feed the tool in so we know

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.120 
definitely feed the tool in so we know
where<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:47.940> stop<00:05:48.350> okay<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:49.410> now<00:05:49.710> we<00:05:49.770> got<00:05:49.980> that

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
where to stop okay so now we got that

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.460 
where to stop okay so now we got that
site<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:51.120> part<00:05:51.480> of<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.630> tool<00:05:51.810> set<00:05:52.169> let's

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
site that part of the tool set let's

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.010 
site that part of the tool set let's
move<00:05:52.889> it<00:05:53.010> over<00:05:53.100> a<00:05:53.280> little<00:05:53.340> bit<00:05:53.520> and<00:05:53.880> run<00:05:54.720> it<00:05:54.840> in

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
move it over a little bit and run it in

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.080 
move it over a little bit and run it in
till<00:05:56.570> whoop<00:05:57.570> set<00:05:57.870> was<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.050> little<00:05:58.350> deep<00:05:58.910> to<00:05:59.910> run

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
till whoop set was a little deep to run

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.090 
till whoop set was a little deep to run
it<00:06:00.210> in<00:06:00.270> until<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.600> just<00:06:00.840> touches<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.910> diameter

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
it in until it just touches the diameter

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.070 
it in until it just touches the diameter
right<00:06:05.100> about<00:06:05.430> there<00:06:05.880> okay<00:06:06.510> we<00:06:06.690> don't<00:06:06.780> need<00:06:06.960> to

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
right about there okay we don't need to

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.750 
right about there okay we don't need to
set<00:06:07.290> this<00:06:07.500> dial<00:06:07.860> because<00:06:08.160> we're<00:06:08.430> not<00:06:08.520> going<00:06:08.669> to

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
set this dial because we're not going to

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.800 
set this dial because we're not going to
move<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:09.030> we're<00:06:09.150> just<00:06:09.180> gonna<00:06:09.389> leave<00:06:09.540> it<00:06:09.600> right

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
move it we're just gonna leave it right

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.520 
move it we're just gonna leave it right
there<00:06:10.220> so<00:06:11.220> we're<00:06:11.400> pretty<00:06:11.669> much<00:06:11.880> ready<00:06:12.120> to<00:06:12.210> cut

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
there so we're pretty much ready to cut

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.190 
there so we're pretty much ready to cut
it's<00:06:13.530> uh<00:06:14.270> let's<00:06:15.270> slow<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.540> down<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.840> little<00:06:15.960> bit

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
it's uh let's slow it down a little bit

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.870 
it's uh let's slow it down a little bit
more<00:06:16.410> we<00:06:16.530> want<00:06:16.680> to<00:06:16.710> go<00:06:16.800> as<00:06:16.919> slow<00:06:17.220> as<00:06:17.370> we<00:06:17.430> can<00:06:17.700> on

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
more we want to go as slow as we can on

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.740 
more we want to go as slow as we can on
this<00:06:18.030> because<00:06:18.240> we<00:06:18.720> don't<00:06:18.870> want<00:06:18.990> it<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.169> chatter

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
this because we don't want it to chatter

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.810 
this because we don't want it to chatter
there's<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:21.840> lot<00:06:22.020> of<00:06:22.280> like<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.400> said<00:06:23.430> there's<00:06:23.760> a

there's a lot of like I said there's a
lot<00:06:23.850> of<00:06:24.150> tool<00:06:24.930> in<00:06:25.110> contact<00:06:25.560> with<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.800> work<00:06:25.979> so

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
lot of tool in contact with the work so

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.700 
lot of tool in contact with the work so
it's<00:06:26.430> going<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.180> want<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.419> chatter<00:06:27.690> so<00:06:28.530> oil

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
it's going to want to chatter so oil

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.580 
it's going to want to chatter so oil
everything<00:06:29.040> up<00:06:29.280> good<00:06:29.520> with<00:06:29.760> some<00:06:30.290> nice<00:06:31.290> heavy

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.800 

watching<00:06:41.750> her<00:06:41.840> dial<00:06:42.110> here

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:56.050 

so<00:06:47.350> you<00:06:47.470> know<00:06:47.590> when<00:06:47.830> to<00:06:47.950> stop

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.040 

we're<00:06:57.060> getting<00:06:57.270> close

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
we're getting close

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.480 
we're getting close
ten<00:06:58.470> more<00:06:58.650> thousand<00:07:00.979> that<00:07:01.979> little<00:07:02.250> chatter

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
ten more thousand that little chatter

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.089 
ten more thousand that little chatter
going<00:07:02.819> here's<00:07:03.120> back<00:07:03.509> off<00:07:03.810> a<00:07:03.840> little<00:07:03.960> bit<00:07:04.199> it's

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
going here's back off a little bit it's

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:20.170 
going here's back off a little bit it's
kind<00:07:05.280> of<00:07:05.370> sneaked<00:07:05.580> up

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.490 

there<00:07:21.180> we<00:07:21.330> go

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.700 

alright<00:07:27.170> so<00:07:28.170> there's<00:07:28.350> a<00:07:28.440> radius<00:07:30.380> it's<00:07:31.380> a<00:07:31.530> nice

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
alright so there's a radius it's a nice

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.130 
alright so there's a radius it's a nice
finish<00:07:32.160> these<00:07:32.910> these<00:07:33.240> cutters<00:07:33.810> are

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140 
finish these these cutters are

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.330 
finish these these cutters are
accurately<00:07:34.950> ground<00:07:35.360> it<00:07:36.360> makes<00:07:36.630> a<00:07:36.720> really<00:07:36.870> nice

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340 
accurately ground it makes a really nice

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.330 
accurately ground it makes a really nice
smooth<00:07:38.340> accurate<00:07:38.880> radii<00:07:39.210> and<00:07:40.340> that's

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
smooth accurate radii and that's

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.130 
smooth accurate radii and that's
basically<00:07:41.730> how<00:07:41.940> you<00:07:41.970> use<00:07:42.150> a<00:07:42.180> corner<00:07:42.840> rounding

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.140 
basically how you use a corner rounding

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.570 
basically how you use a corner rounding
