00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
another addition to axe creation today

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.930 
another addition to axe creation today
I'm<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.859> show<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.219> really<00:00:08.730> simple

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
I'm going to show you a really simple

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.180 
I'm going to show you a really simple
way<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.299> incorporate<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:10.200> odd<00:00:10.410> time<00:00:10.770> into

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
way to incorporate some odd time into

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.520 
way to incorporate some odd time into
your<00:00:11.309> plank<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.840> easiest<00:00:13.110> way<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.290> do

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
your plank and the easiest way to do

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.560 
your plank and the easiest way to do
that<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.099> start<00:00:14.309> learning<00:00:14.700> some<00:00:14.969> repeating

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that is to start learning some repeating

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
that is to start learning some repeating
patterns<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.800> gonna<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:17.040> playing<00:00:17.189> in

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
patterns so we're gonna be playing in

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
patterns so we're gonna be playing in
five<00:00:17.970> eight<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.360> if<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:18.900> unfamiliar<00:00:19.230> with

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
five eight and if you're unfamiliar with

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.689 
five eight and if you're unfamiliar with
that<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.680> exactly<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> sounds<00:00:20.460> like

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
that it's exactly what it sounds like

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.939 
that it's exactly what it sounds like
it's<00:00:20.880> five<00:00:21.119> eighth<00:00:21.480> notes<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.830> we're

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it's five eighth notes and what we're

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
it's five eighth notes and what we're
gonna<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:24.119> gonna<00:00:24.210> break<00:00:24.539> those

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
gonna do is we're gonna break those

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.120 
gonna do is we're gonna break those
eight<00:00:24.960> notes<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.380> into<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:25.710> groups

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
eight notes up into two groups

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
eight notes up into two groups
so<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> group<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.519> three<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> group<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.510> two

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so a group of three and a group of two

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.330 
so a group of three and a group of two
and<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.470> put<00:00:28.619> them<00:00:28.740> into<00:00:28.890> either<00:00:29.039> order

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and you can put them into either order

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.470 
and you can put them into either order
so<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:29.730> actually<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.240> two

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
so we're actually going to have two

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.110 
so we're actually going to have two
combinations<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.400> first<00:00:32.640> example<00:00:33.059> I'm

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
combinations so the first example I'm

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
combinations so the first example I'm
going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.269> show<00:00:33.330> you<00:00:33.449> this<00:00:33.600> one<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.930> called

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
going to show you this one so called

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.560 
going to show you this one so called
Prague<00:00:34.379> it's<00:00:34.710> gonna<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:35.129> two<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.699> three<00:00:36.150> so

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
Prague it's gonna be two and three so

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.430 
Prague it's gonna be two and three so
what<00:00:36.690> we're<00:00:36.780> gonna<00:00:36.839> do<00:00:37.080> is<00:00:37.199> we're<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.379> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

fret on your a string fifth fret on your
E<00:00:42.690> string<00:00:42.839> now<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:44.699> playing<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.120> seven<00:00:45.330> string

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
E string now I'm playing a seven string

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.570 
E string now I'm playing a seven string
if<00:00:46.199> you're<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.530> playing<00:00:46.979> a<00:00:47.070> cemetry<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
if you're not playing a cemetry it

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.880 
if you're not playing a cemetry it
doesn't<00:00:47.820> matter<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> riff<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
doesn't matter just move the riff up so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.460 
doesn't matter just move the riff up so
we<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.280> again<00:00:50.909> major<00:00:51.360> third<00:00:51.659> shake<00:00:51.930> four<00:00:52.260> or

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
we have again major third shake four or

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:11.940 
we have again major third shake four or
five<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.360> then<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.989> next<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:58.290> four

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.840 

we're<00:01:12.950> going<00:01:13.069> to<00:01:13.130> do<00:01:13.219> like<00:01:13.429> I<00:01:13.520> said<00:01:13.729> we're

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
we're going to do like I said we're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.039 
we're going to do like I said we're
going<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.030> break<00:01:14.149> that<00:01:14.359> up<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.719> accident

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
going to break that up in the accident

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.740 
going to break that up in the accident
pattern<00:01:15.649> so<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:15.859> maybe<00:01:16.130> two<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.640> three<00:01:17.359> so

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
pattern so it's maybe two and three so

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.740 
pattern so it's maybe two and three so
we<00:01:17.840> get<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:22.310> what<00:01:23.030> trick<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
we get this and what trick to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.510 
we get this and what trick to
composition<00:01:24.079> riff<00:01:24.560> writing<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.069> what<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.369> can

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
composition riff writing is what you can

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.059 
composition riff writing is what you can
do<00:01:25.670> is<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.869> repeat<00:01:27.590> your<00:01:27.649> pattern<00:01:28.009> a

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
do is so you repeat your pattern a

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.240 
do is so you repeat your pattern a
couple<00:01:28.310> times<00:01:28.579> and<00:01:28.939> then<00:01:29.539> you<00:01:29.929> throw<00:01:30.289> in<00:01:30.679> an

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
couple times and then you throw in an

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.609 
couple times and then you throw in an
even<00:01:31.579> number<00:01:31.849> so<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.179> either<00:01:32.509> add<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.079> or

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
even number so you either add one or

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.380 
even number so you either add one or
take<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:34.130> away<00:01:34.250> from<00:01:34.609> your<00:01:34.729> five<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.240> you've

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
take one away from your five so you've

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.749 
take one away from your five so you've
ahead<00:01:35.599> one<00:01:35.780> six<00:01:36.109> or<00:01:36.709> take<00:01:37.009> one<00:01:37.159> away<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.369> four

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
ahead one six or take one away to four

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.339 
ahead one six or take one away to four
and<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.359> gives<00:01:38.539> it<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.810> illusion<00:01:39.319> of

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
and it gives it the illusion of

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.309 
and it gives it the illusion of
smoothness<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.520> not<00:01:40.789> so<00:01:41.119> against<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.140> beat

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
smoothness and not so against the beat

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.130 
smoothness and not so against the beat
so<00:01:43.099> this<00:01:43.549> particular<00:01:43.789> riff<00:01:44.179> that<00:01:44.539> goes<00:01:44.719> two

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
so this particular riff that goes two

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.959 
so this particular riff that goes two
and<00:01:45.319> three<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.709> do<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:45.950> three<00:01:46.189> times<00:01:46.219> and<00:01:46.759> the

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
and three you do it three times and the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.389 
and three you do it three times and the
fourth<00:01:47.239> measure<00:01:47.509> is<00:01:48.020> your<00:01:48.200> variation<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
fourth measure is your variation so the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.669 
fourth measure is your variation so the
first<00:01:49.640> time<00:01:49.849> it's<00:01:50.149> going<00:01:50.239> to<00:01:50.299> be<00:01:50.390> four<00:01:50.959> and<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
first time it's going to be four and the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.979 
first time it's going to be four and the
second<00:01:51.979> time<00:01:52.159> it's<00:01:52.429> going<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.610> be<00:01:52.759> six<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.840> I'm

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
second time it's going to be six so I'm

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:55.719 
second time it's going to be six so I'm
gonna<00:01:54.079> play<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.439> slope<00:01:54.709> and<00:01:54.950> then<00:01:55.429> we'll<00:01:55.579> play

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
gonna play the slope and then we'll play

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:24.390 
gonna play the slope and then we'll play
this

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
you on the fourth measure on the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.259 
you on the fourth measure on the
variation<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.069> remake<00:02:30.400> those<00:02:30.549> accents<00:02:30.970> really

stand out now the next example we're

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.330 
stand out now the next example we're
going<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:34.720> take<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> look<00:02:35.049> at<00:02:35.230> we're<00:02:36.040> gonna<00:02:36.099> be

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
going to take a look at we're gonna be

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.930 
going to take a look at we're gonna be
playing<00:02:36.489> off<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:37.000> D<00:02:37.690> major<00:02:37.930> chord<00:02:38.940> tenth

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
playing off a D major chord tenth

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.380 
playing off a D major chord tenth
position

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
position

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.009 
position
you<00:02:40.690> have<00:02:40.810> ten<00:02:41.079> ten<00:02:41.849> eleven<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.870> note

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
you have ten ten eleven and the note

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.100 
you have ten ten eleven and the note
we're<00:02:44.170> gonna<00:02:44.260> add<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.040> 13th<00:02:45.579> fret<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:47.049> your

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
we're gonna add is the 13th fret of your

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.940 
we're gonna add is the 13th fret of your
B<00:02:47.500> string

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.330 

basically<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.370> d7<00:02:51.909> chord<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:57.129> we're<00:02:57.250> gonna

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
basically it's a d7 chord so we're gonna

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.470 
basically it's a d7 chord so we're gonna
pick<00:02:57.519> out<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.000> one's<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.359> be

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
pick out now this one's going to be

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.080 
pick out now this one's going to be
reverse<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.049> gonna<00:02:59.140> be<00:02:59.290> three<00:02:59.650> two<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.970> we're

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
reverse it's gonna be three two so we're

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
reverse it's gonna be three two so we're
gonna<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.720> same<00:03:10.930> vein<00:03:11.200> as<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.379> other

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
gonna have the same vein as the other

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.440 
gonna have the same vein as the other
riff<00:03:11.890> we're<00:03:12.400> gonna<00:03:12.489> throw<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.239> measure

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
riff we're gonna throw in the measure

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.619 
riff we're gonna throw in the measure
four<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.200> measure<00:03:14.500> six<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.549> round<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.909> out<00:03:16.090> so

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
four and measure six to round it out so

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:25.929 
four and measure six to round it out so
all<00:03:17.079> these<00:03:17.290> extra<00:03:17.560> notes<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:17.920> I'm<00:03:18.010> playing

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:25.939 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.220 

13<00:03:26.939> under<00:03:27.209> my<00:03:27.390> screen<00:03:29.930> 1111<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.019> our<00:03:31.109> high

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
13 under my screen 1111 on our high

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.759 
13 under my screen 1111 on our high
string<00:03:31.939> down<00:03:32.939> to<00:03:33.090> 11<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.480> your<00:03:33.629> keister<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
string down to 11 on your keister and I

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.470 
string down to 11 on your keister and I
know<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.099> changing<00:03:35.609> again<00:03:36.150> all<00:03:36.450> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
know it's not changing again all of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.259 
know it's not changing again all of
these<00:03:36.689> notes<00:03:36.989> are<00:03:37.260> from<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> G<00:03:37.890> minor<00:03:38.280> scale<00:03:38.579> so

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
these notes are from a G minor scale so

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.460 
these notes are from a G minor scale so
if<00:03:39.329> we<00:03:39.420> play<00:03:39.599> 12<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.260> our<00:03:40.439> g<00:03:40.620> string<00:03:43.670> 11<00:03:44.670> 13<00:03:45.599> 10

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
if we play 12 on our g string 11 13 10

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:55.190 
if we play 12 on our g string 11 13 10
11<00:03:46.950> 13<00:03:47.189> and<00:03:52.819> we're<00:03:53.819> actually<00:03:53.939> borrowing<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:55.019> F

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
11 13 and we're actually borrowing the F

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.179 
11 13 and we're actually borrowing the F
sharp<00:03:55.849> from<00:03:56.849> G<00:03:57.629> harmonic<00:03:57.870> minor<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.920> we<00:03:59.010> get

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
sharp from G harmonic minor so we get

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:08.629 
sharp from G harmonic minor so we get
this<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.900> when<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.169> make<00:04:07.889> that<00:04:08.040> F<00:04:08.220> sharp<00:04:08.250> you

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
this and when you make that F sharp you

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.309 
this and when you make that F sharp you
actually<00:04:08.970> allows<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.629> from<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.870> D<00:04:10.049> minor

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
actually allows you to go from a D minor

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.420 
actually allows you to go from a D minor
chord<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:11.370> do<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.689> D<00:04:13.139> major<00:04:13.409> chord<00:04:13.590> allows

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
chord to do to a D major chord allows

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.640 
chord to do to a D major chord allows
for<00:04:14.669> more<00:04:14.849> harmonic<00:04:15.599> resolution<00:04:16.229> which<00:04:16.500> is

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
for more harmonic resolution which is

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.400 
for more harmonic resolution which is
why<00:04:16.799> it's<00:04:16.979> called<00:04:17.209> harmonic<00:04:18.209> minor<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:19.079> anyway

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
why it's called harmonic minor so anyway

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.040 
why it's called harmonic minor so anyway
so<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:19.979> have<00:04:20.009> our<00:04:20.280> D<00:04:20.489> D<00:04:21.090> chord<00:04:21.449> I<00:04:23.930> said<00:04:24.930> those

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
so we have our D D chord I said those

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.510 
so we have our D D chord I said those
extra<00:04:25.380> notes<00:04:25.590> from<00:04:25.740> measure<00:04:25.919> 4<00:04:26.250> 1<00:04:28.159> and<00:04:29.159> then

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
extra notes from measure 4 1 and then

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.950 
extra notes from measure 4 1 and then
the<00:04:29.580> second<00:04:29.940> time<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.300> gonna<00:04:30.419> be<00:04:30.479> a<00:04:30.599> measure<00:04:30.840> of

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
the second time is gonna be a measure of

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:43.390 
the second time is gonna be a measure of
6<00:04:31.380> we're<00:04:32.070> gonna<00:04:32.190> play

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.710 

and<00:04:44.400> again<00:04:44.610> we're<00:04:44.759> still<00:04:44.970> pedaling<00:04:45.389> off<00:04:45.509> that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
and again we're still pedaling off that

00:04:45.720 --> 00:05:05.960 
and again we're still pedaling off that
f-sharp<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.069> whole<00:04:47.190> thing<00:04:47.400> real<00:04:47.610> slow<00:05:04.970> let

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
f-sharp so the whole thing real slow let

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.399 
f-sharp so the whole thing real slow let
me<00:05:06.060> pick<00:05:06.240> up<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.419> pace<00:05:06.599> so<00:05:06.629> you<00:05:06.930> can<00:05:07.050> hear<00:05:07.259> what

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
me pick up the pace so you can hear what

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:18.050 
me pick up the pace so you can hear what
it<00:05:07.500> sounds<00:05:07.710> like<00:05:16.610> it's<00:05:17.610> cool<00:05:17.879> though

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
it sounds like it's cool though

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.510 
it sounds like it's cool though
repeating<00:05:18.449> pattern<00:05:18.810> now<00:05:19.650> as<00:05:20.009> we<00:05:20.219> talked<00:05:20.400> about

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
repeating pattern now as we talked about

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.070 
repeating pattern now as we talked about
in<00:05:20.879> another<00:05:21.180> lesson<00:05:21.389> we<00:05:21.599> talked<00:05:21.750> about<00:05:21.810> riff

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
in another lesson we talked about riff

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.110 
in another lesson we talked about riff
variation<00:05:22.650> we<00:05:23.159> can<00:05:23.340> take<00:05:23.550> this<00:05:25.849> 7th<00:05:26.849> string<00:05:26.969> I

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
variation we can take this 7th string I

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.580 
variation we can take this 7th string I
can<00:05:27.300> actually<00:05:27.539> drop<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:27.900> down<00:05:28.139> all<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.530> way

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
can actually drop that down all the way

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:36.710 
can actually drop that down all the way
to<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.830> low<00:05:28.979> string

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.390 

play<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.810> same<00:05:38.050> riff<00:05:38.230> down<00:05:38.470> there<00:05:38.710> so<00:05:39.250> what<00:05:39.370> I

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
play the same riff down there so what I

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.190 
play the same riff down there so what I
did<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.610> threw<00:05:40.060> some<00:05:40.240> little<00:05:40.540> simple<00:05:40.780> drum<00:05:40.960> loop

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
did I threw some little simple drum loop
