00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.910
 i have for his new after plant in 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.830
 Canister brought if you can 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.800
 You can always get the rhine here 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:26.269
 nice things going on 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:30.319
 dating back great attachment to the water 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.819
 way be uncool because with me have one 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.530
 few rounds in the aquarium stand and one 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.050
 aquarium and you do not see it over 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.970
 Practically yes what pool is mine 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.000
 but too ugly i should mine 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.350
 once here a next forehead yes but 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.090
 they both too ugly because of that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.410
 both fly out of the picture 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.710
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.410
 issue of my name is clear that the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.150
 christian we have a new one today 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.430
 edition of science of the week for you 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.840
 and that 's about this little one today 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.070
 almost what is almost as already said and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.810
 Although a special something it is 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.259
 small almost only 50 liters sums 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.359
 awesome game 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:14.390
 And yes, the special thing about this case is 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.159
 It almost looks like a real barrick 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.020
 but it is not like an old one 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.990
 because it is made of plastic so look 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.909
 Plastic and the advantage is that me 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.389
 made in one piece so it has none 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.600
 sewed 

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:27.649
 it can not be leaking so that's it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.119
 a very safe thing 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.209
 in contrast to the wood almost there, I know 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.100
 never leak something and that would be too 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.819
 home in his living room by virtue of such a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.889
 parquet floor not quite as much much 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.829
 fancier than the canister was so 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:44.270
 if you are not really into detail right now 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.329
 you can not see that is not real 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.789
 is so yes I have it on the optics 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.709
 50 euro suffering is therefore also a 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.560
 fair price lid is removable 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.469
 and you have an opening and skin 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.090
 you just euro an eighth pump in 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.039
 and go off 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.799
 You have modified a track you have 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.939
 Here cut out what I can see so 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.270
 Of course you can do that on how to do it 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.619
 want 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.860
 I have to sleep somewhere with you 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.120
 with the cable out of the barrel sideways 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.490
 I did not want to because then I would have 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.320
 volume of ponds already almost lost 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.640
 That's why I lost myself for that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.110
 lid did not want to 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.490
 drill in here up there because then 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 looks ugly again because of that 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.650
 I just here this outline here 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.570
 done away down 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 You can just put it here since I left 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.140
 lay is on the back are 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 centimeters still a bit higher though 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.260
 that recognizes and the tax 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.720
 crushed the must indeed as good hospitable 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.520
 did not print on it but 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.300
 very cool 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.070
 So yes, our little tip okay if you 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.750
 So what and ugly nicer want 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.360
 blob in canister probably through such a 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.590
 Plastic almost looks good 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.010
 not so expensive and definitely 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.880
 not exactly suitable for living 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.220
 stop by on our website 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.940

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.240

 until next time
