00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but the question I've been getting a lot

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
but the question I've been getting a lot
is<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> follow<00:01:21.060> simply<00:01:21.479> filling<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
is when I follow simply filling and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.120 
is when I follow simply filling and
simply<00:01:22.200> filling<00:01:22.380> again<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:22.799> eating

simply filling again you're eating

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.719 
simply filling again you're eating
mostly<00:01:23.640> power<00:01:23.880> foods<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.430> because<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> foods

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
mostly power foods and because the foods

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
mostly power foods and because the foods
are<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:26.939> filling<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
are so filling you you're they say you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350

don't<00:01:29.220> have<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> worry<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.610> tracking<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
don't have to worry about tracking and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.340 
don't have to worry about tracking and
you<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> worry<00:01:30.869> about<00:01:30.960> portion

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you don't have to worry about portion

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.469 
you don't have to worry about portion
sizes<00:01:31.590> you're<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.610> learning<00:01:32.970> how<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> eat

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sizes you're really learning how to eat

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
sizes you're really learning how to eat
until<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.840> feel<00:01:34.020> satisfied<00:01:34.560> which<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> true

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
until you feel satisfied which is true

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.510 
until you feel satisfied which is true

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
do I still keep like a food journal when

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.350 
do I still keep like a food journal when
I'm<00:01:41.130> following<00:01:41.520> simply<00:01:41.850> filling<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
I'm following simply filling and the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.310 
I'm following simply filling and the
answer<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.869> yes<00:01:44.329> personally<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.810> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
answer is yes personally I think that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
answer is yes personally I think that
keeping<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.920> food<00:01:47.130> journal<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
keeping a food journal is one of the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.080 
keeping a food journal is one of the
most<00:01:48.810> powerful<00:01:49.200> tools<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.430> utilize

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
most powerful tools that you can utilize

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.469 
most powerful tools that you can utilize
in<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.930> weight<00:01:52.140> loss<00:01:52.290> project<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.119> yes

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
in your weight loss project and so yes

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030 
in your weight loss project and so yes
even<00:01:54.840> when<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.079> falling<00:01:55.259> simply<00:01:55.680> filling<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
even when I'm falling simply filling and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.380 
even when I'm falling simply filling and
I'm<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.219> keeping<00:01:56.399> track<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.969> portion

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I'm not keeping track of the portion

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.910 
I'm not keeping track of the portion
sizes<00:01:57.990> per<00:01:58.259> se<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.770> still<00:01:59.579> keep<00:02:00.740> tracking<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sizes per se I still keep tracking and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.780 
sizes per se I still keep tracking and
journaling<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:03.299> foods<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:03.840> eating<00:02:04.790> because

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
journaling what foods I'm eating because

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
journaling what foods I'm eating because
sometimes<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> scale<00:02:06.600> starts<00:02:06.899> creeping<00:02:07.049> up

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sometimes the scale starts creeping up

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.600 
sometimes the scale starts creeping up
even<00:02:07.560> though<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:07.740> only<00:02:07.920> eating<00:02:08.310> power<00:02:08.520> foods

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
even though I'm only eating power foods

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.550 
even though I'm only eating power foods
and<00:02:09.700> if<00:02:10.240> I'm<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.509> keeping<00:02:10.900> track<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.530> don't

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
and if I'm not keeping track I don't

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.650 
and if I'm not keeping track I don't
know<00:02:11.800> what<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.520> problem<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.150> right<00:02:13.210> so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
know what the problem is right so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.130 
know what the problem is right so
usually<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.320> something<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:15.840> most<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:17.020> my

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
usually it's something like most of my

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.080 
usually it's something like most of my
fruits<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.680> vegetable<00:02:18.070> servings<00:02:18.490> are<00:02:18.730> really

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
fruits and vegetable servings are really

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.810 
fruits and vegetable servings are really
fruits<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.670> haven't

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
fruits so and you know like I haven't

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.030 
fruits so and you know like I haven't
been<00:02:22.330> getting<00:02:22.450> enough<00:02:22.660> vegetables<00:02:23.260> or<00:02:23.500> maybe

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
been getting enough vegetables or maybe

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320 
been getting enough vegetables or maybe
I<00:02:24.100> haven't<00:02:24.250> been<00:02:24.340> getting<00:02:24.490> enough<00:02:24.670> water<00:02:25.030> or

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
I haven't been getting enough water or

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.890 
I haven't been getting enough water or
maybe<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.850> know<00:02:27.970> maybe<00:02:28.270> I'm<00:02:28.480> having<00:02:28.750> too<00:02:28.870> much

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
maybe you know maybe I'm having too much

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.560 
maybe you know maybe I'm having too much
salt<00:02:29.320> so<00:02:30.280> these<00:02:30.760> are<00:02:30.940> things<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.180> wouldn't<00:02:31.420> know

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
salt so these are things I wouldn't know

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.900 
salt so these are things I wouldn't know
if<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.930> weren't<00:02:32.230> journaling<00:02:33.160> or<00:02:33.310> keeping<00:02:33.700> track

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
if I weren't journaling or keeping track

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.820 
if I weren't journaling or keeping track
of<00:02:34.090> my<00:02:34.150> food<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.630> think<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.900> food<00:02:35.080> journal<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.500> so

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
of my food I think a food journal is so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.420 
of my food I think a food journal is so
so<00:02:36.490> important<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.930> yes<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.290> totally<00:02:38.830> track<00:02:39.100> even

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
so important so yes I totally track even

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.160 
so important so yes I totally track even
when<00:02:39.700> I'm<00:02:39.820> following<00:02:40.240> simply<00:02:40.630> filling<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
when I'm following simply filling and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.110 
when I'm following simply filling and
some<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.130> may<00:02:42.280> know<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.430> recently<00:02:42.580> found

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
some of you may know I recently found

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600 
some of you may know I recently found
out<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.480> I'm<00:02:43.630> gluten<00:02:44.020> intolerant<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.800> was

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
out that I'm gluten intolerant I was

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.380 
out that I'm gluten intolerant I was
really<00:02:46.210> really<00:02:46.540> sick<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.380> long<00:02:47.620> time<00:02:47.890> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
really really sick for a long time and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.940 
really really sick for a long time and
no<00:02:49.390> digestive<00:02:49.660> problems<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> didn't<00:02:50.920> think

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
no digestive problems so I didn't think

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.400 
no digestive problems so I didn't think
that<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.400> having<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.730> food<00:02:51.910> sensitivity<00:02:52.410> but

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that I was having a food sensitivity but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.990 
that I was having a food sensitivity but
my<00:02:53.500> doctor<00:02:53.680> checked<00:02:54.100> everything<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.820> so

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
my doctor checked everything out and so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.520 
my doctor checked everything out and so
when<00:02:55.150> he<00:02:55.270> asked<00:02:55.600> what<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> was<00:02:55.900> eating<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.380> was

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
when he asked what I was eating I was

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.290 
when he asked what I was eating I was
able<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.800> show<00:02:57.040> him<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.459> food<00:02:57.700> journal<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.270> he

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
able to show him my food journal and he

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.720 
able to show him my food journal and he
was<00:02:59.290> able<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.530> start<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.890> pinpoint<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.459> maybe

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
was able to start a pinpoint that maybe

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.000 
was able to start a pinpoint that maybe
it<00:03:00.910> might<00:03:01.030> be<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.330> gluten<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.650> was<00:03:02.890> in

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it might be the gluten and that was in

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.740 
it might be the gluten and that was in
fact<00:03:03.160> what<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.459> turned<00:03:03.640> out<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.420> I

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
fact what it turned out to be and so I

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.210 
fact what it turned out to be and so I
would<00:03:05.170> never<00:03:05.380> have<00:03:05.560> known<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:05.920> I'd<00:03:06.100> probably

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
would never have known that I'd probably

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.270 
would never have known that I'd probably
still<00:03:06.580> be<00:03:06.700> growing<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.630> having<00:03:07.840> migraines

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
still be growing up and having migraines

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.860 
still be growing up and having migraines
if<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.430> hadn't<00:03:09.730> been<00:03:09.820> keeping<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.240> detailed<00:03:10.630> food

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
if I hadn't been keeping a detailed food

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.300 
if I hadn't been keeping a detailed food
journal<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.260> think<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.680> really<00:03:11.920> super

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
journal so I think it's really super

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.070 
journal so I think it's really super
important<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.700> yes<00:03:13.090> even<00:03:13.420> when<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.720> follow

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
important so yes even when I follow

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.900 
important so yes even when I follow
simply<00:03:14.980> feeling<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.400> I'm<00:03:15.459> not<00:03:15.640> worrying

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
simply feeling and I'm not worrying

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.870 
simply feeling and I'm not worrying
about<00:03:16.000> points<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.720> math<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.110> all<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.380> I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
about points and math and all of that I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.440 
about points and math and all of that I
totally<00:03:18.880> still<00:03:19.269> track<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:22.000> know<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> mean
