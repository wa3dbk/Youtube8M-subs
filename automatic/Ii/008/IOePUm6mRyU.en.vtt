Hi 
This is Sami from fawziacademy.com 
In this video I will talk about 

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:21.832
What is uric acid? 
Uric acid is a heterocyclic compound of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen with the formula 

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:34.666
Uric acid is a Chemical Compound
Created when the body breaks down substances called purines. 

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:43.099
Purines are found in some foods and drinks. 
These include, liver, anchovies, mackerel, dried beans 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.333
And peas, and beer.
Most uric acid dissolves in blood 
And travels to the kidneys.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:01:02.499
From there, it passes out in urine. If your body produces too much uric acid or doesn't remove enough from it, you can get sick. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:16.766
Blood Test must Performed to check how much uric acid you have in your blood. Another test can be used to check the level of uric acid in 

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:28.999
your urine.
In human blood plasma, the reference range of uric acid is typically 3.4-7.2 mg/dL for men and 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.333
2.4-6.1 mg/dL for women 
Uric acid concentrations above and below the normal range

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:46.799
are known, respectively, as hyperuricemia and hypouricemia. 
Causes of high uric acid

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:56.600
In many instances, people have elevated uric acid levels for hereditary reasons
Diet may be a factor. High intake of dietary 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.966
purine, high-fructose corn syrup, and table sugar can cause increased levels of uric acid 
Serum uric acid can be elevated due to reduced 

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:13.899
excretion by the kidneys 
Fasting or rapid weight loss can temporarily 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.166
elevate uric acid levels
Certain drugs, such as  diuretics, can increase uric acid levels in the blood 

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:28.899
Saturation levels of uric acid in blood may result in one form of kidney stones when the urate crystallizes in the kidney 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:42.733
And can lead to a type of arthritis known as gout.[26] This painful condition is the result of needle-like crystals of uric acid precipitating in 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:52.066
joints, capillaries, skin, and other tissues
