00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.640
 armani 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.510
 if women's fashion for me is absolutely to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.720
 it is an incomprehensible thing then man's last 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.370
 time makes me happy more often tell me 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.210
 young man you have in life 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:23.950
 some kind of hobby 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:26.410
 fishing is almost the right answer I 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.100
 I know for sure that for anyone 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:38.190
 men in this world are a hobby 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:41.320
 do nothing very much like fishing 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.120
 seriously and we are very angry just about very 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.360
 outta when we are distracted from our 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.600
 favorite activity when I sit at home for 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.760
 computer and read I do not know for example about 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.240
 new models of robots from the designer 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.459
 lego 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.010
 fits my girlfriend just quiet 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.630
 Zhenya says it's just a little bit like me 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.030
 writes how she dares not distract that 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.730
 may be more important than new ones 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.769
 models of robots from Lego to 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.660
 I do not say this, I know that in 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.239
 relation to the most important thing is a compromise 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.010
 in this case it is right that just 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.299
 I'm sorry I'm not talking 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.720
 didn't mean to distract you 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.430
 simply 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.430
 we have a balcony 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:39.580
 but what do I answer her 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.900
 Come tomorrow, I'll take care of all 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.480
 last time my girlfriend try 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.850
 don't talk when i do nothing 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.800
 she just fits pokes me with her finger 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.200
 it's terribly annoying and not screaming 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.730
 such a glory comes along to a friend of the rooms 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.830
 from living here and that's why i think 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.590
 that male fashion now taxis some 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.410
 very cunning and very lazy man 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.490
 who does not want to do nothing at all 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.820
 so let's think together what 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:12.700
 latest trends in men's fashion 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:15.270
 don't shave don't wear socks don't 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.530
 zip the bottom buttons on the jacket 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.600
 men come up with fashion to something 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.620
 don't do women also tried 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.660
 use this chip 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.210
 remember they even styled these 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:33.640
 coral skirt to the floor 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:35.770
 so as not to shave his legs but men desire 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.760
 don't do anything or she somewhere here on 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.980
 level of instincts 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.880
 even god is the very first man that he is 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.550
 brought Russia do not kill not steal not 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.350
 commit adultery we have listed everything 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.830
 activities just moses not that 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.830
 listened to 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.540
 so now fashion to strive for 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.780
 so that men do not strain that you do not 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.840
 you feel comfortable here 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.660
 it is convenient to say but what is comfortable and 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.300
 there are still some kind of skinny jeans 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.460
 tight shirts leather jackets and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.979
 You will be right because the male fashion 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.110
 there are two directions one is oriented 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.470
 on convenience the second is focused on 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.470
 hockey 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.259
 maybe this is too rude a word but i 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.690
 I can speak because I am the third 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:39.160
 I have such a mom Ukrainian dad Russian 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:41.139
 Caucasian dog well, in general he has a breed 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.960
 chow chow but he's all hairy somewhat 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.289
 brothers that I think he is Caucasian 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.289
 thank you very much
