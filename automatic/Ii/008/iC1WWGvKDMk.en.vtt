00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the most efficient one that I have and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.870 
the most efficient one that I have and
the<00:01:32.140> other<00:01:32.290> one<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.620> in<00:01:32.710> Chicago<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.610> much

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
cheaper but it's not as reliable you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.400 
cheaper but it's not as reliable you
have<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.550> change<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.910> bail<00:01:37.150> quite<00:01:37.960> often<00:01:38.140> in

there you basically just unscrew the
course<00:01:41.920> from<00:01:42.100> there<00:01:42.370> and<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:43.390> keep<00:01:43.900> them<00:01:44.050> by<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
course from there and you keep them by a

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.930 
course from there and you keep them by a
bunch<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.770> fails<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.280> have<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.520> change<00:01:45.760> the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
bunch of fails and have to change the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.880 
bunch of fails and have to change the
belt<00:01:46.090> insight<00:01:46.980> happens<00:01:47.980> quite<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.280> lot

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
belt insight happens quite a lot

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.290 
belt insight happens quite a lot
just<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.220> has<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.460> button<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.270> just

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
just one has a button so you can just

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.500 
just one has a button so you can just
shut<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.080> down<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.460> wrong<00:01:53.640> tone<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.150> plug<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
shut it down the wrong tone just plug it

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.899 
shut it down the wrong tone just plug it
in<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.870> works<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> hold<00:01:56.670> two

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
in and it works so this one can hold two

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.020 
in and it works so this one can hold two
barrels<00:01:57.650> so<00:01:58.650> I<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.920> touch<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.760> the
