okay<00:00:01.129> hi<00:00:02.159> well<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.090> 89<00:00:03.840> Ford<00:00:04.380> Taurus

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
okay hi well this is my 89 Ford Taurus

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay hi well this is my 89 Ford Taurus
and<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.759> just<00:00:06.270> had<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> problem<00:00:06.690> with<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.140> where

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
and I just had a problem with this where

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.110 
and I just had a problem with this where
the<00:00:07.560> fuel<00:00:07.799> pump<00:00:08.069> would<00:00:08.280> not<00:00:08.460> turn<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.880> last

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the fuel pump would not turn on last

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.299 
the fuel pump would not turn on last
night<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.540> was<00:00:09.599> about<00:00:09.929> 55<00:00:10.559> degrees<00:00:11.040> outside

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
night it was about 55 degrees outside

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.690 
night it was about 55 degrees outside
and<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.660> lot<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.840> people<00:00:13.230> think<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.070> fuel<00:00:14.370> pump

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and a lot of people think the fuel pump

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.930 
and a lot of people think the fuel pump
goes<00:00:15.660> wrong<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.190> lot<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.490> times<00:00:17.789> it's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
goes wrong but a lot of times it's

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.840 
goes wrong but a lot of times it's
actually<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.619> ircam<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.800> integrated<00:00:20.460> relay

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
actually the ircam the integrated relay

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.960 
actually the ircam the integrated relay
control<00:00:21.330> module<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.369> I'm<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.609> tell<00:00:23.789> you

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
control module and I'm going to tell you

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.759 
control module and I'm going to tell you
about<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> figure<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.320> whether<00:00:25.529> it's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
about how to figure out whether it's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.300 
about how to figure out whether it's
actually<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> fuel<00:00:26.460> pump<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> relay<00:00:28.890> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
actually the fuel pump or the relay for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.450 
actually the fuel pump or the relay for
the<00:00:29.460> fuel<00:00:29.670> pump<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.179> how<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> bypass<00:00:31.460> that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the fuel pump and how to bypass that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.900 
the fuel pump and how to bypass that
relay<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.329> turn<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> fuel<00:00:34.770> pump<00:00:34.860> maybe<00:00:35.700> in

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
relay and turn on the fuel pump maybe in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
relay and turn on the fuel pump maybe in
case<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.270> need<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.480> drain<00:00:36.840> gas<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
case you need to drain gas out of the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
case you need to drain gas out of the
tank<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.180> anyways<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
tank so anyways when you look in the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.580 
tank so anyways when you look in the
engine<00:00:40.950> compartment<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:42.079> all<00:00:43.079> kinds<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
engine compartment here all kinds of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.950 
engine compartment here all kinds of
stuff<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:44.010> over<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.309> place<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.969> people

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
stuff all over the place and people

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.610 
stuff all over the place and people
normally<00:00:46.739> can't<00:00:47.010> figure<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.930> what<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.170> what

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
normally can't figure out what is what

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.819 
normally can't figure out what is what
the<00:00:50.600> integrated<00:00:51.600> relay<00:00:52.020> control<00:00:52.440> module

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the integrated relay control module

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.850 
the integrated relay control module
IRCAM<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> actually<00:00:54.120> hidden<00:00:54.360> underneath<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
IRCAM is actually hidden underneath this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.200 
IRCAM is actually hidden underneath this
engine<00:00:56.489> label<00:00:56.879> right<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.930> and<00:01:00.109> it<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:02.210> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the IR CM and a lot of times these would

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
the IR CM and a lot of times these would
have<00:01:09.750> problems<00:01:10.140> where<00:01:10.500> people<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:11.010> drive

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have problems where people would drive

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.300 
have problems where people would drive

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
their cars they turn off the engine come

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520 
their cars they turn off the engine come
back<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.689> wouldn't<00:01:15.930> start<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
back and it wouldn't start all of a

going<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.739> do<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> check<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.459> this<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:32.170> could

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
going to do a check on this we could

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.009 
going to do a check on this we could
hook<00:02:32.590> up<00:02:32.890> power<00:02:33.370> directly<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.660> and

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
hook up power directly to this and

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.460 
hook up power directly to this and
bypass<00:02:35.890> all<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.299> electrical<00:02:37.900> circuitry

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
bypass all of the electrical circuitry

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.309 
bypass all of the electrical circuitry
if<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:38.769> put<00:02:39.040> 12<00:02:39.730> volts<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.150> power<00:02:40.180> right<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
if we put 12 volts of power right to the

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.740 
if we put 12 volts of power right to the
pump<00:02:41.620> we<00:02:42.519> could<00:02:42.700> hear<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:42.970> turn<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> best

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
pump we could hear it turn on the best

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.250 
pump we could hear it turn on the best
place<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.079> do<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.829> at<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> alternator

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
place to do that is at the alternator

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.760 
place to do that is at the alternator
over<00:02:47.260> here<00:02:47.470> we'll<00:02:47.590> just<00:02:47.799> slide<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.250> boot<00:02:48.579> off

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
over here we'll just slide this boot off

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.610 
over here we'll just slide this boot off
this<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.400> connected<00:02:51.000> directly<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
this is connected directly to the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.070 
this is connected directly to the
battery<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> power<00:02:54.510> source<00:02:54.960> right

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
battery so this is a power source right

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.810 
battery so this is a power source right
here<00:02:55.610> plug<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.820> there<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.860> then<00:02:58.860> I'm<00:02:59.580> going<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
here plug in there and then I'm going to

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.210 
here plug in there and then I'm going to
touch<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.780> number<00:03:01.200> five<00:03:01.470> terminal

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
touch this to the number five terminal

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
touch this to the number five terminal
and<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.910> listen<00:03:03.150> closely<00:03:03.570> you'll<00:03:03.960> hear

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
and if you listen closely you'll hear

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.030 
and if you listen closely you'll hear
the<00:03:04.320> pump<00:03:04.590> turn<00:03:04.980> on

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.330 

do<00:03:10.549> you<00:03:10.640> hear<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:12.530> probably<00:03:12.890> can't<00:03:13.129> hear

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
do you hear that you probably can't hear

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.940 
do you hear that you probably can't hear
when<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.610> car<00:03:13.879> goes<00:03:14.090> by<00:03:14.530> but<00:03:15.530> when<00:03:15.680> you're<00:03:15.799> up

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
when a car goes by but when you're up

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.100 
when a car goes by but when you're up
close<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:22.090> can<00:03:23.090> hear<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.420> fuel<00:03:23.659> flowing

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
close I can hear the fuel flowing

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.630 
close I can hear the fuel flowing
through<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.220> fuel<00:03:25.489> lines<00:03:25.730> in<00:03:26.090> here<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:27.170> if<00:03:27.640> you

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
through the fuel lines in here so if you

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.660 
through the fuel lines in here so if you
want<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.599> if<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.890> do<00:03:31.069> that<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.489> hear

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
want to so if you do that and you hear

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.699 
want to so if you do that and you hear
the<00:03:31.790> pump<00:03:32.000> turn<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.110> know<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.440> fuel

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
the pump turn on you know your fuel

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.910 
the pump turn on you know your fuel
pumps<00:03:34.040> not<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.340> problem<00:03:34.790> if<00:03:35.690> you're<00:03:35.900> maybe<00:03:36.799> in

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
pumps not the problem if you're maybe in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.289 
pumps not the problem if you're maybe in
an<00:03:37.129> emergency<00:03:37.609> situation<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.970> think

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
an emergency situation and you think

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.809 
an emergency situation and you think
maybe<00:03:42.290> your<00:03:42.909> IRCAM<00:03:43.909> unit<00:03:44.269> is<00:03:44.450> faulty<00:03:45.670> what<00:03:46.670> you

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
maybe your IRCAM unit is faulty what you

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.599 
maybe your IRCAM unit is faulty what you
could<00:03:47.000> do<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:49.299> bypass<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.540> ircam<00:03:51.409> unit<00:03:51.859> and

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
could do is is bypass the ircam unit and

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.860 
could do is is bypass the ircam unit and
you'd<00:03:52.730> have<00:03:52.849> to<00:03:53.030> stick<00:03:53.329> these<00:03:53.510> screwdrivers

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
you'd have to stick these screwdrivers

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.319 
you'd have to stick these screwdrivers
in<00:03:54.290> here<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:55.010> probably<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.180> most

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
in here this is probably the most

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.110 
in here this is probably the most
difficult<00:03:56.599> step<00:03:57.400> pry<00:03:58.400> up<00:03:58.450> both<00:03:59.450> ends<00:03:59.810> of<00:04:01.120> this

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
difficult step pry up both ends of this

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.920 
difficult step pry up both ends of this
clip<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.750> push<00:04:03.470> out<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:08.060> now<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.299> remove<00:04:08.720> the

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
clip and push out so now you remove the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.390 
clip and push out so now you remove the
clip

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.740 

and<00:04:12.650> then<00:04:13.879> there's<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:15.000> rubber<00:04:15.320> gasket<00:04:16.320> in<00:04:16.859> here

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
and then there's a rubber gasket in here

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.810 
and then there's a rubber gasket in here
the<00:04:18.750> next<00:04:19.079> step<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.040> slide<00:04:20.220> one<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.729> your

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
the next step is to slide one of your

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:32.060 
the next step is to slide one of your
screwdrivers<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.840> pull<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:25.020> up<00:04:31.070> like

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
screwdrivers in and pull this up like

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.280 
screwdrivers in and pull this up like
that<00:04:32.660> that<00:04:33.660> out<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.229> way

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
that that out of the way

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.140 
that that out of the way
you'll<00:04:37.290> need<00:04:37.440> some<00:04:37.770> needlenose<00:04:38.100> pliers<00:04:38.699> that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
you'll need some needlenose pliers that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.980 
you'll need some needlenose pliers that
have<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.570> pretty<00:04:40.760> pretty<00:04:41.760> small<00:04:42.150> tip<00:04:42.479> in<00:04:42.690> there

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
have a pretty pretty small tip in there

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.430 
have a pretty pretty small tip in there
and<00:04:43.400> there<00:04:44.400> are<00:04:44.520> two<00:04:45.139> red<00:04:47.210> locking<00:04:48.440> pin

screwdriver down and push that clip out

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.770 
screwdriver down and push that clip out
of<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.830> way<00:05:29.010> oh<00:05:31.160> there<00:05:32.160> we<00:05:32.280> go<00:05:32.389> now<00:05:33.389> you<00:05:33.419> can

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
of the way oh there we go now you can

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:43.129 
of the way oh there we go now you can
slide<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.289> wire<00:05:34.440> out<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:38.810> now<00:05:41.599> put<00:05:42.599> this<00:05:42.780> back

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
slide the wire out and now put this back

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.939 
slide the wire out and now put this back
in<00:05:43.320> place

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.980 

again<00:05:46.949> this<00:05:47.129> I'm<00:05:47.340> simulating<00:05:47.819> an<00:05:48.270> emergency

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
again this I'm simulating an emergency

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.640 
again this I'm simulating an emergency
situation<00:05:49.289> maybe<00:05:50.039> you're<00:05:50.370> out<00:05:51.139> somewhere<00:05:52.139> you

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
situation maybe you're out somewhere you

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.290 
situation maybe you're out somewhere you
can't<00:05:53.580> get<00:05:53.759> to<00:05:53.939> a<00:05:53.969> repair<00:05:54.449> station<00:05:55.340> and<00:05:56.340> you

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
can't get to a repair station and you

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.029 
can't get to a repair station and you
think<00:05:57.569> maybe<00:05:57.719> your<00:05:58.020> IRC<00:05:58.590> m.u<00:05:59.310> is<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.849> problem

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
think maybe your IRC m.u is the problem

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.850 
think maybe your IRC m.u is the problem
IRC<00:06:02.039> em<00:06:02.310> unit<00:06:02.610> also<00:06:02.969> controls<00:06:03.770> well<00:06:04.770> it

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
IRC em unit also controls well it

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.950 
IRC em unit also controls well it
controls<00:06:05.249> four<00:06:05.550> functions<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.389> full<00:06:06.659> pump

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
controls four functions the full pump

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.390 
controls four functions the full pump
the<00:06:07.259> fan<00:06:07.529> and<00:06:08.659> two<00:06:09.659> other<00:06:09.840> things<00:06:09.930> I<00:06:10.560> can't

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
the fan and two other things I can't

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.170 
the fan and two other things I can't
remember<00:06:13.249> but<00:06:14.249> if<00:06:14.370> your<00:06:14.490> fuel<00:06:14.759> pump<00:06:14.939> is<00:06:15.150> the

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
remember but if your fuel pump is the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.640 
remember but if your fuel pump is the
problem<00:06:15.719> now<00:06:17.360> I'll<00:06:18.360> just<00:06:18.569> demonstrate<00:06:19.020> for

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
problem now I'll just demonstrate for

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:32.310 
problem now I'll just demonstrate for
you<00:06:19.939> trying<00:06:20.939> to<00:06:21.000> start<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.449> car<00:06:21.479> with<00:06:22.289> that

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.630 

that<00:06:33.320> was<00:06:33.470> the<00:06:33.590> last<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.100> fuel<00:06:34.370> pressure

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
that was the last of the fuel pressure

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.290 
that was the last of the fuel pressure
burning<00:06:35.330> off<00:06:38.260> now<00:06:39.260> after<00:06:40.070> that<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.580> fuel<00:06:41.030> pump

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
burning off now after that the fuel pump

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.890 
burning off now after that the fuel pump
turned<00:06:41.600> off<00:06:45.760> it's<00:06:46.760> not<00:06:47.000> turning<00:06:47.330> on<00:06:47.510> because

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
turned off it's not turning on because

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.930 
turned off it's not turning on because
there's<00:06:48.080> no<00:06:48.290> fuel<00:06:48.620> pressure<00:06:50.740> so<00:06:51.740> I'm<00:06:52.670> going<00:06:52.880> to

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
there's no fuel pressure so I'm going to

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.000 
there's no fuel pressure so I'm going to
clip<00:06:53.540> into<00:06:55.210> positive<00:06:56.210> 12<00:06:56.870> volts<00:06:57.290> and<00:06:57.470> hook

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
clip into positive 12 volts and hook

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.160 
clip into positive 12 volts and hook
this<00:06:58.220> up<00:06:58.280> I'm<00:06:59.210> going<00:06:59.330> to<00:06:59.420> wait<00:06:59.540> for<00:06:59.570> this<00:06:59.900> car

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
this up I'm going to wait for this car

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.140 
this up I'm going to wait for this car
to<00:07:00.350> go<00:07:00.470> by<00:07:00.680> so<00:07:00.920> hopefully<00:07:01.490> you<00:07:01.610> can<00:07:01.760> hear<00:07:02.000> the

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150 
to go by so hopefully you can hear the

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:10.720 
to go by so hopefully you can hear the
fuel<00:07:02.330> pump<00:07:02.690> turn<00:07:02.960> on<00:07:07.900> now<00:07:08.900> if<00:07:09.560> you<00:07:10.340> listen<00:07:10.700> very

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
fuel pump turn on now if you listen very

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.530 
fuel pump turn on now if you listen very
carefully

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
carefully

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.440 
carefully
it's<00:07:12.380> a<00:07:12.470> high-pitched<00:07:13.010> whine<00:07:13.400> I'm<00:07:14.180> going<00:07:14.390> to

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
it's a high-pitched whine I'm going to

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.060 
it's a high-pitched whine I'm going to
start<00:07:14.720> the<00:07:14.870> engine<00:07:17.170> fuel<00:07:18.170> pump<00:07:18.500> is<00:07:18.740> running

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
start the engine fuel pump is running

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:35.140 
start the engine fuel pump is running
and<00:07:19.430> pumping<00:07:19.970> fuel<00:07:20.240> right<00:07:20.600> now

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.780 

feel<00:07:35.660> pressures<00:07:36.080> dropping<00:07:36.410> engine<00:07:37.250> shuts<00:07:37.610> off

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:37.790 
feel pressures dropping engine shuts off

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:43.330 
feel pressures dropping engine shuts off
that's<00:07:38.720> it<00:07:40.150> go<00:07:41.150> ahead
