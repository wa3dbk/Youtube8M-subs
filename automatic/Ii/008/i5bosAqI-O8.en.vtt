00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.899
 the fecam 

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.470
 you are very happy very nice 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.920
 now we can with much but lack 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.029
 and here 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.029
 what better time to say 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.890
 I do not have 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 truly clear that it's always because 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.779
 they will say what is 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 before 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.470
 valley of 61 see a step back 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.030
 but that step back 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.170
 According to Blesa, it can become fundamental 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 if you realize what you just did 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 because if one does not realize what we have just done 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.130
 does not have one for micro 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.830
 and then a criticism will not be worth it if you do not have the minimum 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.609
 idea 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.750
 and the criteria of what just happened 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.500
 review it with your teachers 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 Ulises 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.150
 efe according to Mr. enrique who has 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.750
 thank you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.300
 will strive 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.160
 and they rehearsed a whole week for a song that came out very out of tune 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 will explode in Spain that figure accomplishes 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.970
 the song appears corrects that song is pathetic as to the respect julieta 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.570
 venegas I find the song terrible but I know what to do is horrible 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.000
 songs from his point of view if I find it terrible and hey lola 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.010
 worse the last time and add 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 so I hope you surprise me next week with something 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.179
 thank you thank you don arturo lÃ³pez 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.220
 now a very short question 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.600
 to each one of you 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.090
 before they were conforming the casting that you were doing 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 what do you work on 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.190
 this said 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.450
 the pp studies what 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.720
 the high school 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.250
 teliasonera daughter device 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219
 and if they had not entered the academy 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.239
 that day of their lives that will be their lives and the project has between 10 and 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:06.880
 18 years each 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.550
 the ocean since it's a very long life the testosterone but decided not to 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.049
 lend a valid list of speakers 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.049
 what are you going to want 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.949
 at the moment very well the boys 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.629
 so as Raul said 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:26.950
 they rethink 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.529
 what they are looking for 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.930
 I do not agree in the least with what lizette said that her mom 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:33.729
 song 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.209
 especially with strauss talking about the most important Mexican author of these 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.339
 last years 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.539
 and then comes the rest 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.719
 the rest is 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.429
 there is another pay what you have to hold rallies 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.020
 which is how Enrique said 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.219
 the attitude 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.209
 they left panama 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.039
 and another thing 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.640
 it was not a genuine position 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.449
 everyone did it by their side 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.129
 that maybe that's also 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.150
 what yes 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.719
 re rescued the interpretation 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.259
 we give children 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.899
 to the area 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 to their places of origin 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.279
 therefore with the car to the critics 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.959
 it is noticeable in any case that they are getting used to the scenario 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.249
 They have shown an excellent presence
