00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.670
 the neighbors of the western neighborhood are without 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.709
 doubt those who are most mobilized the capital 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.480
 Salamanca called urban car are 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.430
 leaving the decorated buildings of 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.120
 very original ways one of them is 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.120
 the 18th nest 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.080
 another of them is the viewpoint and there is a 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.390
 third they are doing that what 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.500
 we have right here to our right and 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.689
 that will decorate the western neighborhood 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.720
 for many years 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.580
 ximena aragones talavera makes a 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.680
 activity within the framework of the easy somewhat 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.230
 peculiar and a bit risky because 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.080
 is the heights yes yes and so many 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.420
 that are six floors and for me the highest 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.879
 what have I done as I know that such is 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.620
 paint at 30 or 40 meters high 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.239
 fun addition when you are up there not 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.860
 you are not aware of the height because 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.460
 How are you looking in front of the work? 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.100
 you're not looking, you're not watching 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.229
 the height you are going to paint or are you painting 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.559
 a girl runs a candelabra 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.269
 illuminates a library if I have not 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.629
 lost because I've been flown before 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.000
 sketch of the photo but good usually 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.920
 I'm not doing it as I do not 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.970
 project or anything so what I go 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.369
 coming out at the time but in a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.030
 principle if it is a woman especially a 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.640
 candlestick and there are some there are some 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.869
 books around and because that image that 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.150
 wants to represent what you want to give to 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.610
 understand with this image 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.610
 understand that this is a cultural neighborhood 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 and the shoes association that is what 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.960
 I invited to come here they 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.100
 originally proposed that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.450
 since it was a very cultural neighborhood 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 they were doing a lot of things 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 here the street they were opening a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 Lots of new and related sites 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 with this world then I thought it was what 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.140
 more suitable to do in this neighborhood not 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.899
 I'm going to do an abstract I'm going to do 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.090
 something satanic will also be studied 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.549
 with simple reading I do not know maybe in 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
 what they cover shortly 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.450
 but if this goes hard I do not know how long it lasts 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.509
 the painting on the wall but with the least 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.459
 ten years hard though good I'm still 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.679
 young at the best in a while I 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.209
 feel like retouching it or changing some 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.220
 things and if truth in the opportunity what 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.750
 under what materials do you use by what technique 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.340
 is using so we do not understand 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.140
 some of this roller and acrylic spray 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 I have not decided to use acrylic 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.640
 because it does not make you dizzy if you take spray 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.890
 normal montana enamel so 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.480
 you have to wear a mask and although 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.940
 good is outdoors does not influence either 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.100
 So much so that you get dizzy and because you 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.739
 intoxicates a lot and the truth that with 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.940
 acrylic paint acrylic but not 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.380
 will be particular in your life I think I've 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
 travel several countries of europe or 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.910
 something like that not painting in any 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.650
 city get together a little bit this was with 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.750
 cee carrion caesar carrion that is a 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.230
 Madrid artist very good very 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.269
 shocking and nothing went crazy 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.120
 14,000 kilometers by car all of Europe 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.560
 up to the polar circle ' three days a day 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.329
 that is the whole day of day in 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.209
 finland and in the north then we go down 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.859
 by sessions by norway all europe 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.769
 we go down Estonia Latvia Lithuania 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.160
 everything and we could paint in all the 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.200
 cities as some work on the street 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.410
 and the truth is that it was a great experience 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.900
 and this fondness for art from where you 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.870
 it comes or why it reaches this comes to me from 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.850
 I imagine it comes from my mother my 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.770
 Grandpa is a painter and my mother is also 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.990
 portrait artist then it's something that always 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.330
 seen at home my mother she lives in peru 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.160
 now for a long time and neither 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.020
 we have a lot of contact but reach us' 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.960
 both physical and it is written then 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.610
 He has not been able to teach me everything 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.730
 I would like but I still have 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.740
 time that I'm 26 years old still gives me 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.500
 I have time to experience a lot 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.140
 more and nothing because I imagine it's something that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.900
 you are born and then for two years 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.450
 is that he dedicated me to painting although I study 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.640
 I am an interior designer and 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.180
 decorator at the national institute of 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.180
 design of madrid
