hello so this is an instructional video

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.599 
hello so this is an instructional video
on<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.090> do<00:00:03.500> control<00:00:04.500> horns<00:00:05.009> control

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
on how to do control horns control

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.960 
on how to do control horns control
surfaces<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.839> pushrods<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.250> install<00:00:08.550> servos

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
surfaces and pushrods and install servos

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
surfaces and pushrods and install servos
and<00:00:09.000> all<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.510> stuff

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
and all that stuff

and all that stuff
so<00:00:10.290> first<00:00:10.590> let's<00:00:10.889> pretend<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.639> like<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
so first let's pretend this is like the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.240 
so first let's pretend this is like the
wing<00:00:12.210> or<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> tail<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:13.019> an<00:00:13.110> airplane<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.740> I'm

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
wing or the tail of an airplane and I'm

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.340 
wing or the tail of an airplane and I'm
trying<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.759> make<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.969> elevator<00:00:15.450> or<00:00:15.750> something

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
trying to make an elevator or something

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.260 
trying to make an elevator or something
so<00:00:16.770> first<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.490> you're<00:00:17.609> gonna<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.119> you're

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
so first what you're gonna do is you're

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.599 
so first what you're gonna do is you're
gonna<00:00:18.330> cut<00:00:18.720> like<00:00:19.170> what<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.430> out

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
gonna cut like what you want to do out

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.599 
gonna cut like what you want to do out
so<00:00:21.330> pretend<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.380> part<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> attached<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
so pretend this part is attached to the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.390 
so pretend this part is attached to the
plane<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.750> part<00:00:25.019> moves<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
plane and this part moves like that and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.950 
plane and this part moves like that and
then<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.849> you're<00:00:27.029> gonna<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
then what you're gonna want to do is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
then what you're gonna want to do is
take<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.650> piece<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.250> moves<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.880> lay<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
take your piece that moves and lay a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
take your piece that moves and lay a
ruler<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.109> top<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.059> or<00:00:33.059> something<00:00:33.270> like

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
ruler on top of it or something like

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.740 
ruler on top of it or something like
that<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.520> cut<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.450> angle

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that and then you cut it at an angle

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.610 
that and then you cut it at an angle
down<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.190> beveled<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.960> then

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
down so it's beveled like that and then

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.410 
down so it's beveled like that and then
what<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> take<00:00:41.670> your<00:00:41.940> beveled

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
what you want to do is take your beveled

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
what you want to do is take your beveled
piece<00:00:42.690> put<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.170> upside<00:00:43.559> down<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.070> put<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
piece put it upside down and put the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
piece put it upside down and put the
other<00:00:45.329> piece<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.989> next<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.550> get

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
other piece right next to it and get

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
other piece right next to it and get
this<00:00:48.000> side<00:00:48.300> yeah<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.500> take<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> piece<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

clear tape or some kind of tape like
this<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:54.390> lay<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:56.250> control

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this and just lay it over your control

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.930 
this and just lay it over your control
surface<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> back<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.340> looks<00:00:59.789> like

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
surface so on the back it looks like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
surface so on the back it looks like
that<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.809> lay<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.230> over<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that and just lay it over and then to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
that and just lay it over and then to
reinforce<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:03.660> good<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> take<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
reinforce it it's also good to take it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
reinforce it it's also good to take it
and<00:01:05.070> bend<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> other<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.960> just

and bend it the other way and then just
lay<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> piece<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> tape<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.850> over<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> side

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
lay a piece of tape right over that side

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.270 
lay a piece of tape right over that side
so<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.740> nice<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.070> good<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.950> now<00:01:13.950> for

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so it's nice and good and now for

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
so it's nice and good and now for
installing<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.880> control<00:01:15.509> horn<00:01:15.840> your

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
installing your control horn your

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
installing your control horn your
control<00:01:16.439> horn<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.159> thing<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.729> push<00:01:17.970> rod

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
control horn is the thing the push rod

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.780 
control horn is the thing the push rod
goes<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> other

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
goes on to and then that on the other

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.030 
goes on to and then that on the other
side<00:01:20.880> attaches<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> servo<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.619> moves

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
side attaches to the servo so that moves

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.690 
side attaches to the servo so that moves
so<00:01:23.909> first<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.170> is

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
so first of all what you want to do is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
so first of all what you want to do is
you<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> lay<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.450> lathe<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you want to lay this lathe out of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.190 
you want to lay this lathe out of
control<00:01:28.799> horn<00:01:29.070> flat<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> foam<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.720> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
control horn flat like on the foam and I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.120 
control horn flat like on the foam and I
like<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.610> tip<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:34.590> where<00:01:34.860> your

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like to have the tip like where your

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.429 
like to have the tip like where your
push<00:01:35.400> rods<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.850> attached<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> about<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
push rods get attached to about on the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
push rods get attached to about on the
line<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.979> usually<00:01:38.400> do<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> little<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.030> over<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
line I usually do a little more over so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
line I usually do a little more over so
I<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.229> control<00:01:40.520> but<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.700> what

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
I can have more control but then what

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819 
I can have more control but then what
you<00:01:42.030> want<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.479> stand<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.619> kind

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you want to do is stand it up and kind

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.230 
you want to do is stand it up and kind
of<00:01:43.920> push<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> down<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> leaves<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.000> little

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of push it down so it leaves a little

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
of push it down so it leaves a little
indentation<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.799> take<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> knife<00:01:47.399> or

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
indentation and then take a knife or

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
indentation and then take a knife or
whatever<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.710> cut<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:50.240> little<00:01:51.240> slit<00:01:52.110> right

shorter and then the other end that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.200 
shorter and then the other end that
attaches<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.160> your<00:02:36.250> servo<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:36.940> what<00:02:37.090> you'll

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
attaches to your servo but what you'll

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.510 
attaches to your servo but what you'll
want<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.420> do<00:02:37.570> here<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.680> mine<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.280> just

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
want to do here is with mine you just

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.030 
want to do here is with mine you just
want<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> open<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.300> up<00:02:40.450> open<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.410> part<00:02:41.650> up<00:02:41.800> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
want to open it up open this part up and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.420 
want to open it up open this part up and
then<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.150> will<00:02:43.540> slide<00:02:44.140> right<00:02:44.350> through<00:02:44.430> so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
then it just will slide right through so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.370 
then it just will slide right through so
the<00:02:45.610> little<00:02:45.940> stick<00:02:46.540> will<00:02:46.660> be<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:47.140> through

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
the little stick will be going through

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.380 
the little stick will be going through
the<00:02:47.500> hole<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:47.950> looking<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> control<00:02:49.120> horn

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
the hole and looking in the control horn

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.990 
the hole and looking in the control horn
and<00:02:49.810> then<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.830> slide<00:02:51.340> or<00:02:51.520> Auto<00:02:51.640> ran<00:02:51.850> or

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
and then you just slide or Auto ran or

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.420 
and then you just slide or Auto ran or
whatever<00:02:52.360> over<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:52.840> I'll<00:02:52.930> holds<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.430> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
whatever over so I'll holds it on and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280 
whatever over so I'll holds it on and
then<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.940> pushes<00:02:55.300> back<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.840> forth<00:02:56.050> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
then that pushes back and forth the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.230 
then that pushes back and forth the
servo<00:02:56.590> pushes<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.070> back<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.430> forth<00:02:57.520> and

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
servo pushes that back and forth and

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.720 
servo pushes that back and forth and
that<00:02:58.570> moves<00:02:58.750> your<00:02:58.959> control<00:02:59.260> surface<00:02:59.620> is<00:03:00.340> take

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
that moves your control surface is take

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.840 
that moves your control surface is take
a<00:03:01.000> servo<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.250> other<00:03:03.520> side<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
a servo and have the other side of the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.120 
a servo and have the other side of the
control<00:03:04.180> horn<00:03:04.390> through<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.780> servo<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.290> then

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
control horn through the servo and then

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.850 
control horn through the servo and then
go<00:03:07.000> ahead<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.270> put<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.900> on<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.440> had<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.680> take

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
go ahead and put that on I had to take

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.830 
go ahead and put that on I had to take
my<00:03:09.010> other<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:10.180> what<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.720> do

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
my other one out and then what you do

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.930 
my other one out and then what you do
with<00:03:10.959> your<00:03:10.989> servo<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.430> can<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.820> can

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
with your servo is you can you can

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.670 
with your servo is you can you can
basically<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.360> glue<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.900> down<00:03:14.080> onto<00:03:14.650> your

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
basically just glue it down onto your

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.490 
basically just glue it down onto your
foam<00:03:14.980> or<00:03:15.489> if<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.090> want<00:03:16.330> this<00:03:16.540> trace<00:03:16.900> trace

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
foam or if you want this trace trace

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.710 
foam or if you want this trace trace
around<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.920> servo<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.610> foam<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.090> then

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
around the servo on the foam and then

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.290 
around the servo on the foam and then
just<00:03:19.930> cut<00:03:20.170> out<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:21.130> shape<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.180> then

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
just cut out that that shape and then

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.850 
just cut out that that shape and then
just<00:03:22.480> stick<00:03:22.660> your<00:03:22.750> servo<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.380> glue<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.620> but

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
just stick your servo in and glue it but

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.560 
just stick your servo in and glue it but
I'm<00:03:23.950> not<00:03:24.040> gonna<00:03:24.190> do<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.550> so<00:03:24.850> that's<00:03:25.269> how<00:03:25.480> you

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
I'm not gonna do that so that's how you

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.259 
I'm not gonna do that so that's how you
do<00:03:25.870> pushrods<00:03:26.440> control<00:03:27.220> horns<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.940> all<00:03:28.030> that

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
do pushrods control horns and all that

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.670 
do pushrods control horns and all that
good<00:03:28.450> stuff<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:29.500> thanks<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.040> watching<00:03:30.100> bye
