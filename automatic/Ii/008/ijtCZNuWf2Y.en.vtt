00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
 gameplay leave that are already rolling so much 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.219
 here on the channel account on youtube integers 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.050
 a closed beta game place that rolled 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.030
 for people who have been avoided 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.910
 to play nÃ© edson industry people 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 in October the big gringos out there 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.059
 pro player and things of the right kind and it's the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 from today from today 12th 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 at three o'clock in Time 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 Brasilia allowed was posting 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.850
 this type of content is this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.949
 gameplay you are seeing on the map 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.689
 that is one is one of the maps that will 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.610
 available in beta in beta will have 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.950
 one yields to the crab which is what it goes 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 talk about the city of the official game and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.000
 a factor that did not know what this is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.979
 then the mode being played is the mode 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 east xanana extend that it is also 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 present in the beta that that way 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.680
 resembles with sorting destroys no 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 It provides a bomb type thing but 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 that you die did not review in the round are not 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080
 divided into five rounds in fact a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.869
 better than five 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 right and then what happens is that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.110
 world is born into a titan I already know 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 which he has already begun within a titan 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.070
 everybody from the two teams is already born of a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.720
 titan and if you die you only live in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.369
 next round as I told the team that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.130
 wins the round is the team to eliminate 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.200
 all titans of the opposing team or 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.530
 stay with more titans until the end of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.240
 given time in the round I believe and give neither 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.770
 knows on this Thursday of the very pity 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 how is the module differentiated from 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.290
 others do not because the battles are focused 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 basically the right titans and the player 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.520
 who was following him unfortunately 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.350
 does not play very well and from what we see 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.700
 he died and now the other 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 players but it's good because the people 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 can see in the third person how 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 I went the battles right? 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.060
 we can see it's a pretty thing 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.740
 intense is kind is frenetic 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.540
 only at the same time it is patience 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.040
 You can see that it's time consuming for you. 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.470
 kill a citizen who stays in several 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.850
 battles for the covers of the powers to him 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.310
 I do not know how the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.310
 shields the one a machine gun I do not know 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.380
 What is then is a battle of patience 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.300
 wanting or not and at the same time 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.770
 which I believe will involve a lot 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.900
 That's what I think for you to play well. 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.090
 Since then you have to be good. 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.000
 will be something similar for example there is 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.340
 no df for example a guy who is a guy 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.080
 who controls a helicopter well does 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.390
 a lot of difference knows that a good pilot 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.770
 it 's not I think it's going to be even more 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.600
 important than that because the titans 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.340
 not much more important within the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.170
 trailer in the background that a helicopter has 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.990
 importance within a game of bf 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.990
 making a parameter there but I 'm 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.880
 pretty excited to see how good it is 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.110
 good it will be you be good with the titanium is 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.640
 because I think it's going to be much more 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.870
 that you just know how to hit a 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.030
 kick at your opponent you have to 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.830
 also know how to avoid the shots knowing the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.210
 time to spend your powers 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.440
 say of the titan because there must be 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.090
 a limit you can not stand by 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.430
 example using that shell the time 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.480
 Everybody knows stuff like that, I guess. 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.010
 We're going to have to learn to play. 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.740
 with the titans to get the most out 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.840
 possible of the game right like I said 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.310
 'now open only one day 14 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.920
 clarification that I have not made clear in the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.420
 first video about the goal is ask will be 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.040
 open of who is selected will eat 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.920
 will begin to be sent from the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.480
 day 14 but until the 17th that the second 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.790
 you can still receive a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.770
 here then get to 14 open cast 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.900
 you do not get here only to hope 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.360
 17 is possible so that you receive 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.310
 a certain open farm begins in the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.560
 on the 14th when he said from 10 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.330
 pm Brasilia time on pc 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.680

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.150
