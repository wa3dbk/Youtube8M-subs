00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 good afternoon how to save water why am i 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.790
 This topic is for doing and I want to talk 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.590
 because water tariffs do for everything 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.710
 the rest also grow by leaps and bounds 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.710
 for hours 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.070
 consequently who can not save water 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.600
 it means the booth pay more well will 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 you can pay a little 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:36.400
 save i know what 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.850
 when there is no water here when there is no water there is no and 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.760
 when it is not enough you save it many 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.510
 know that here before people of my age 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.650
 in private houses not everyone had water 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.900
 wells and there were taps and accounted for so 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.269
 publicly the screen had to be in the water 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.629
 dragging buckets naturally if i 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.970
 I 'll bring even 10 buckets of water 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.100
 hard work even two buckets is hard 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.620
 bring me grief that's why you 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 water is very very save then chasing 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.350
 still faced and faced with 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.299
 problem when there is no water in the apartment 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.190
 who in Odessa knows that in Odessa often 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.290
 problems with water especially with hot 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.979
 water but from cold too 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.070
 moments when there is no water even a day or two 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.149
 sometimes it was a week 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.710
 we always stood and 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:35.680
 such barrels the end of the car and it was stored there 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.659
 water is clean water she always stood about 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.369
 reserve duty yes because especially 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.979
 difficulties when we experienced when with 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.549
 May to September they came 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.850
 relatives pinned signs buffer friends 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.700
 and fat 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.369
 in to devi on the sea natural flow of water 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.619
 big and wing or not need to think and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.229
 all teach how this water saves well 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.000
 let's tell you everything as it should be 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.190
 from test 1 Colorado let here 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.520
 there are counters for someone that 's good 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.140
 for whom it is bad for us it is good 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.900
 said apartment and counters well when 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.110
 of course the tap does not flow no where does not drip 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.239
 nowhere is also very well needed when 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.790
 dripping put the pot or put 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.519
 can see how much water you dripping 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.220
 but there, too, in the toilet and economically 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:35.269
 vodichku spend all the rest am 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.750
 woke up we go brush your teeth 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.780
 you can take a glass or a glass 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.000
 connect properly use 10 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.670
 liters and 15 liters of water just to 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.310
 to brush your teeth 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.170
 Basically enough one cup of water 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.200
 rinsed mouth cleaned 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.970
 toothbrush with a paste or with a powder and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.280
 the dentist was rinsed again 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.070
 the oral cavity is clean and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.500
 neat and fresh breath then we 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.000
 bathroom lovers 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.660
 but who surely has a bad heart 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.160
 hypertension and everything else we don't 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.340
 take a hot bath 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.120
 but many period lovers take it so 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.959
 we will save to take a shower too 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.209
 neat neat and do not take 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.489
 before the shower let's stand for half an hour or 40 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.940
 five minutes to five minutes is enough 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.970
 it will be as well as possible to save 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.560
 then rinse yourself water turned off 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.590
 soaped up there foam what he would eat 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.580
 put on the body and again it's all see or 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.260
 that is, you can even wash 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:52.470
 head 2 liters of water and if there is such 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.330
 I need such savings, but let me 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.610
 I 'll tell you know what else you can 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.590
 we have a lot of water goes to the dishes to wash 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.930
 dishes many do not even appear as 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.380
 You can economical and helped very simply 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.750
 when there is no water you quickly find 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.710
 or when you need and drag both or panel 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.910
 easy and simple and I take very little water 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.500
 You can take a saucepan and a half liters two 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.019
 liter of water 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.740
 no more and even if you will be a mountain 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.560
 dishes 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.070
 you can easily wash start taking hot 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.230
 I pour some water for the time being still water if not 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.250
 Extremely give pouring hot water can be 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:38.490
 take soda can take if there is 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.530
 mustard powder and here by the eye 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.320
 Well, let's say there is a spoon in front of my eyes 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.200
 I put in mustard powder 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.610
 such a little mustard water and then I 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.340
 I didn't do the dishes specially 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.240
 to show it all you stir 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.820
 all I will lower the plates of the spoon you can 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.470
 let's fill it up let her stand but in 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.090
 it is not necessary because she 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:06.180
 washing quickly is easy just for you and so I 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:11.780
 I take a sponge and all this in this 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.780
 pan neatly here and we 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:19.380
 little plates of water a saucepan so you 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.850
 say it's dirty you're not dirty 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.760
 mustard powder 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:30.120
 he does his job no fat no 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.810
 nothing and forks all here then of course 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.229
 if you still have 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:40.140
 but the water there are no problems that include 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:43.590
 the tap and these are all little plates i have spoons 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.870
 I rinse the twigs and if 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.870
 here we admit really which is necessary 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.990
 saving so i will take and 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.560
 this water just pour out apollos here atori 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.510
 this pot and 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.000
 the future tass pieces to fill or in this 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.160
 same pot purely water again payment 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.220
 but this is already if if the diesel engine has no water 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.660
 then judge to still economy we erase and 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.960
 the car in front of it there are few things and we 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.350
 do laundry every day need a car 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.950
 loaded will be less likely to erase more 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.740
 we will save some water and when manual 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.950
 washing still will save more 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:30.240
 Of course we do not save ourselves , but it 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.760
 I washed the water for the first time there 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.690
 Powder washed this water 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.700
 pour into a bowl and great with visa we 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.670
 rinse then the same water already 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.150
 more or less clean if clean we are all i 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.040
 with mary this water can be used up 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.770
 pour out the bucket and wash the floor would wash in 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.300
 the floor that is, even in such a Pharisee 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.760
 means sleep will not do the cleaning and 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.680
 Now I will do this washing up this 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.840
 water should not be poured out 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.030
 that is, the toilet here is the same in my 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.610
 and if such a problem as we had all 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.130
 a bunch of a bunch of guests that certainly stood 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:13.820
 water is water was worth its weight in gold i 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:17.790
 I say my little tips like 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:20.970
 save water so little secret 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:23.310
 life experience I shared with you 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.770
 maybe you know something more 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.690
 you can still bathe 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.690
 with little to the pure water of all the good 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.690
 until
