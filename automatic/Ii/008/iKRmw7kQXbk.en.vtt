munchkin version a lot of it is about

might say that he couldn't kick down the
door<00:01:27.619> which<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:29.310> very<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.939> an

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

door which is not very good for an
adventurer<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.600> perhaps<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.200> because

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
adventurer and perhaps that was because

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.670 
adventurer and perhaps that was because
he<00:01:31.590> had<00:01:31.619> contracted<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> purse<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.470> things

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
he had contracted a purse and so things

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.670 
he had contracted a purse and so things
are<00:01:34.829> pretty<00:01:34.860> bad<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:36.200> for<00:01:37.200> cronuts

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
are pretty bad for for cronuts

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
are pretty bad for for cronuts
but<00:01:37.890> improper<00:01:38.610> munchkin<00:01:39.060> style<00:01:39.329> part<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
but improper munchkin style part of the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.480 
but improper munchkin style part of the
thing<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> munchkin<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.590> breaking<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> fourth

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
thing a munchkin is breaking the fourth

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
thing a munchkin is breaking the fourth
wall<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.180> could<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> Cronus

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
wall a little so could be the Cronus

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.660 
wall a little so could be the Cronus
player<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.799> paid<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> pizza

so everything was okay and now cronut is
happening<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> other<00:01:48.119> hand<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.810> that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
things there's a lot of them something I

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.230 
things there's a lot of them something I
would<00:02:11.440> say<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:12.040> makes<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.610> distinctive

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
would say that makes this distinctive

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.990

from other munchkins there's not a lot

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.690 
from other munchkins there's not a lot
that<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.720> entirely<00:02:17.410> new<00:02:17.860> we're<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.190> trying<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
that is entirely new we're not trying to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.550 
that is entirely new we're not trying to
make<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.000> complicated<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.600> confusing<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
make it complicated and confusing the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
make it complicated and confusing the
main<00:02:20.830> thing<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.430> completely<00:02:22.090> unique<00:02:22.270> to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
main thing that is completely unique to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.130 
main thing that is completely unique to
munchkin<00:02:23.650> gloom<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.640> we<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> number<00:02:25.750> of

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
munchkin gloom is we have a number of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.800 
munchkin gloom is we have a number of
events<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.240> basically<00:02:28.240> trigger

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
events that basically trigger

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.500 
events that basically trigger
immediately<00:02:29.650> when<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.890> draw<00:02:30.280> them<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.820> so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
immediately when you draw them and so

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.650 
immediately when you draw them and so
that<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:33.070> we<00:02:33.340> have<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.760> example<00:02:33.790> split<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
that is so we have for example split the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.470 
that is so we have for example split the
party<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.410> split<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.430> party<00:02:36.820> says<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.210> have

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
party and split the party says you have

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.030 
party and split the party says you have
to<00:02:37.660> play<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:37.990> right<00:02:38.200> away<00:02:38.380> when<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.650> draw<00:02:38.980> it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
to play it right away when you draw it

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.870 
to play it right away when you draw it
and<00:02:39.400> each<00:02:40.090> player<00:02:41.040> selects<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.220> character<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
and each player selects a character and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.630 
and each player selects a character and
passes<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> player<00:02:44.020> on<00:02:44.500> their<00:02:45.010> their

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
passes it to the player on their their

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.300 
passes it to the player on their their
left<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.870> there's<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> few<00:02:47.500> things<00:02:47.800> like<00:02:48.070> that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
left and there's a few things like that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.430 
left and there's a few things like that
and<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:49.060> me<00:02:49.240> sort<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> goal<00:02:50.080> there<00:02:50.290> was<00:02:50.320> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and to me sort of the goal there was to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.840 
and to me sort of the goal there was to
try<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:50.740> capture<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.220> way<00:02:51.340> munchkin<00:02:51.730> his

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
try and capture the way munchkin his

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.640 
try and capture the way munchkin his
persons<00:02:52.330> where<00:02:52.570> it's<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:52.840> things<00:02:53.170> suddenly

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
persons where it's just things suddenly

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.770 
persons where it's just things suddenly
happen<00:02:53.980> unexpectedly<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:55.240> you've<00:02:55.360> got<00:02:55.540> that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
happen unexpectedly so you've got that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.630 
happen unexpectedly so you've got that
of<00:02:56.050> these<00:02:56.170> few<00:02:56.620> things<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.250> come<00:02:57.460> up

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
of these few things that can come up

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.280 
of these few things that can come up
when<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.120> least<00:02:58.300> expect<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:58.960> change

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
when you least expect it and change

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.830 
when you least expect it and change
things<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.790> also<00:03:01.060> have<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> lot<00:03:01.810> more

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
things but you also have a lot more

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.200 
things but you also have a lot more
cards<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:03.100> mean<00:03:03.400> things<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:04.090> your

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
cards that do mean things to your

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.080 
cards that do mean things to your
neighbors<00:03:04.800> because<00:03:05.800> that's<00:03:06.700> part<00:03:06.970> of

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
neighbors because that's part of

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.740 
neighbors because that's part of
munchkin<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.810> for<00:03:08.230> example<00:03:08.800> in<00:03:09.750> traditional

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
munchkin so for example in traditional

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.170 
munchkin so for example in traditional
glue<00:03:10.990> you<00:03:11.860> might<00:03:12.070> get<00:03:12.280> married<00:03:12.430> magnificently

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
glue you might get married magnificently

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.940 
glue you might get married magnificently
and<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.720> would<00:03:13.900> say<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.580> draw<00:03:15.820> two<00:03:15.880> cards

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
and that would say you draw two cards

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.250 
and that would say you draw two cards
now<00:03:17.950> here<00:03:18.370> we<00:03:18.760> might<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.240> trusted<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.020> thief

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
now here we might have trusted a thief

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.610 
now here we might have trusted a thief
and<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.340> would<00:03:21.550> say<00:03:21.790> draw<00:03:22.300> two<00:03:22.540> cards<00:03:22.620> from

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
and that would say draw two cards from

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.920 
and that would say draw two cards from
the<00:03:23.800> hand<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.100> player<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.460> your<00:03:24.550> left<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the hand of the player to your left and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.900 
the hand of the player to your left and
you<00:03:26.590> know<00:03:26.680> there's<00:03:26.890> more<00:03:27.160> things<00:03:27.430> like<00:03:27.670> that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
you know there's more things like that

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.550 
you know there's more things like that
where<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.240> effect<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.900> same<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.260> get<00:03:29.440> two

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
where the effect is the same you get two

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.200 
where the effect is the same you get two
cards<00:03:29.770> but<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.070> hurts<00:03:30.220> somebody<00:03:30.460> else<00:03:30.610> and

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
cards but it hurts somebody else and

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.840 
cards but it hurts somebody else and
like<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.990> said<00:03:32.050> that<00:03:32.440> gets<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.770> little<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.670> the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
like I said that gets a little of the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.940 
like I said that gets a little of the
backstabby<00:03:34.450> flavor<00:03:34.960> that<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.470> associate

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
backstabby flavor that you associate

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.560 
backstabby flavor that you associate
with<00:03:36.010> munchkin<00:03:36.580> without<00:03:36.850> completely

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
with munchkin without completely

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.540 
with munchkin without completely
changing<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.440> rules<00:03:38.770> of<00:03:38.950> glory<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:41.550> again
