00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.149 
rifle I have right here right this is
the<00:02:33.280> primary<00:02:33.790> DLC<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> sniper<00:02:35.260> rifle<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.069> a

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
the primary DLC a sniper rifle it is a

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.339 
the primary DLC a sniper rifle it is a
bolt-action<00:02:36.640> look<00:02:37.269> how<00:02:37.420> long<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:38.019> took<00:02:38.170> me

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
bolt-action look how long that took me

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.699 
bolt-action look how long that took me
to<00:02:38.590> reload<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.220> gun<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:39.849> am<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.049> bad<00:02:41.290> with<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
to reload that gun I am so bad with the

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.890 
to reload that gun I am so bad with the
sniper<00:02:41.980> rifle<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:43.000> not<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> one<00:02:43.510> hit<00:02:43.689> it's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
sniper rifle and it's not a one hit it's

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.089 
sniper rifle and it's not a one hit it's
still<00:02:44.079> a<00:02:44.109> two<00:02:44.379> hit

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
still a two hit

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.699 
still a two hit
so<00:02:45.430> if<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.549> gonna<00:02:45.670> have<00:02:45.849> one<00:02:46.420> suggestion<00:02:47.109> for

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
so if I gonna have one suggestion for

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.069 
so if I gonna have one suggestion for
this<00:02:47.889> game<00:02:48.579> when<00:02:48.939> involving<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.569> sniper<00:02:49.870> if

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
this game when involving that sniper if

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.379 
this game when involving that sniper if
what<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.409> saw<00:02:50.620> would<00:02:50.950> be<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.340> maybe<00:02:51.939> fix

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
what you just saw would be to maybe fix

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.940 
what you just saw would be to maybe fix
the<00:02:52.599> reload<00:02:52.900> time<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.169> little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.620> they<00:02:53.919> are

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the reload time a little bit they are

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.920 
the reload time a little bit they are
pretty<00:02:54.370> much<00:02:54.430> super<00:02:54.700> humans<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.359> super<00:02:55.659> suits

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
pretty much super humans and super suits

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.289 
pretty much super humans and super suits
so<00:02:56.919> I<00:02:56.950> would<00:02:57.310> hope<00:02:57.639> that<00:02:57.669> they<00:02:57.970> would<00:02:58.060> be<00:02:58.239> able

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
so I would hope that they would be able

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.879 
so I would hope that they would be able
to<00:02:58.419> reload<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> gun<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.290> little<00:02:59.470> bit<00:02:59.680> quicker

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
to reload a gun a little bit quicker

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.699 
to reload a gun a little bit quicker
because<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.730> can't<00:03:01.419> do<00:03:01.810> anything<00:03:02.200> unless<00:03:02.379> I<00:03:02.590> hit

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
because I can't do anything unless I hit

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.349 
because I can't do anything unless I hit
a<00:03:02.769> lucky<00:03:03.040> collateral<00:03:03.549> with<00:03:03.669> that<00:03:03.819> thing<00:03:04.060> but

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
a lucky collateral with that thing but

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.240 
a lucky collateral with that thing but
it<00:03:04.480> looks<00:03:04.689> cool<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.379> an<00:03:05.439> iron<00:03:05.620> sigh<00:03:05.919> and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
it looks cool and it's an iron sigh and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.080 
it looks cool and it's an iron sigh and
it<00:03:06.340> kind<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.579> gets<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.939> feel<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:09.129> know<00:03:09.250> olden
