00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:08.029
 How about friends, well, here is a video 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.900
 fast just to show that this is 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:16.990
 my spirit is ultra and how can you see 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.660
 I'm already in the lollipop version 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:25.990
 as you can see it is very very fluid 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.990
 5 points 0.2 as you can see 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.970
 in mesÃ³n and experient two ultras we are going to 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.670
 see the model so everything is 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.760
 checked before you and this ends 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.750
 to do this afternoon is very easy here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 is of 53 03 which to start dragon 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.790
 can verify your model the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
 update on is already this one no 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.040
 it's official way I had to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.600
 download I had to do this by means 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.420
 of the computer but they are very steps 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.699
 simple as you can see and everything is 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.610
 in lollipop I do not have applications for 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.700
 telcel only these are from 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.560
 Taiwan the application comes from Taiwan 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.290
 but well you can eliminate me 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.290
 it seems if we are going to corroborate now 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.750
 we'll see 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.150
 installed 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.040
 to do that I can not erase them but 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.510
 just there is staying 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.130
 the truth is that it did not affect much in 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.170
 worry the three the ones that were other 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.300
 good things come more complicated 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.120
 right now I do not have anything of the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.160
 multitasking this fascinated me the update 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.680
 this phone to loli for the truth me 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.960
 he liked too much I feel like he gave 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.940
 life to this phone apart I already felt 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.369
 like that very stagnant but the truth is not 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.780
 I regret having done what I did 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.479
 which was to force the update and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.940
 manually update it from this the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.690
 truth appears the first time I go to 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.729
 open the camera I'm very excited 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.790
 remember not to show again allow 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.170
 let's see the camera interface 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.539
 let's see how long it continues 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.490
 lasting the same to me it seems I do not know if 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.470
 new modes will arrive for these modes 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.030
 will fall faster look at this 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.090
 it will take a little longer it is already a bit 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.730
 faster functions if I change the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 view only the capture view of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.540
 touch sound 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.670
 it has only changed that there is the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.700
 update let's see the album how 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.730
 has improved the album 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.690
 it's still the same let's see what I did 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.450
 I returned the pulse because now 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.069
 what they see the first time now not 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.629
 this is the interface I think it follows 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.099
 being equal to it there is no 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.660
 change let's close everything is super 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.700
 I am really happy with the truth 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.440
 sectorization later I'm going to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 video show how as 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.680
 update it the truth is I'm nothing 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.150
 sorry and I'm watching the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.980
 use of battery also that 's 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.410
 something very important in me and is what 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.180
 I will see this I hope that you 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.920

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.540
 upload this video in less than five 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 minutes I assure you that you already 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.299
 are going to do some experts for 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.069
 update this model and they are not going to 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.740
 repent they will not regret being the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.550
 I swear I have not seen the keyboard 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.070
 let's see also keyboard as you see is 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.480
 almost equal almost the same as the other but 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.760
 is I think it's a little bit smaller and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.050
 I like it better this good I hope that you 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360
