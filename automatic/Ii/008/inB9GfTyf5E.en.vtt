well<00:00:42.469> it's<00:00:42.680> interesting<00:00:43.340> is<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:44.890> focus<00:00:45.890> there

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
well it's interesting is a focus there

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.500 
well it's interesting is a focus there
was<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.910> good<00:00:47.840> verse<00:00:48.019> with<00:00:48.320> HIV<00:00:48.860> infection<00:00:49.510> and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
was a good verse with HIV infection and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.590 
was a good verse with HIV infection and
so<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.440> various<00:00:52.120> frequencies<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.449> wave

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
so the various frequencies and wave

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.950 
so the various frequencies and wave
patterns<00:00:54.079> were<00:00:54.260> adjusted<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.930> by<00:00:56.930> a

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
patterns were adjusted to that by a

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.490 
patterns were adjusted to that by a
similar<00:00:57.620> principle<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:59.890> system<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:02.500> at

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
similar principle the system and at

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.800 
similar principle the system and at
least<00:01:03.829> theoretically<00:01:04.009> be<00:01:04.670> adjusted<00:01:05.239> to

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
least theoretically be adjusted to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.350 
least theoretically be adjusted to
address<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.770> processes<00:01:07.399> of<00:01:07.430> aging<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.119> cell

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
address the processes of aging of cell

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.850 
address the processes of aging of cell
so<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:10.009> net<00:01:10.220> result<00:01:10.580> would<00:01:10.759> be<00:01:11.380> applying<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
so the net result would be applying the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.580 
so the net result would be applying the
signal<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.179> appropriate<00:01:14.929> wave

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
signal with the appropriate wave

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.169 
signal with the appropriate wave
adjustments<00:01:16.399> and<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.610> appropriate

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
adjustments and the appropriate

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.080 
adjustments and the appropriate
molecular<00:01:17.780> targets<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.530> literally<00:01:19.520> instruct

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
molecular targets and literally instruct

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.559 
molecular targets and literally instruct
the<00:01:20.450> aging<00:01:20.840> process<00:01:21.069> to<00:01:22.069> go<00:01:22.280> in<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.030> opposite

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
the aging process to go in the opposite

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.200 
the aging process to go in the opposite
direction

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
