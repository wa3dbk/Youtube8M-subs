the page and I love working with this is
a<00:01:11.790> drywall<00:01:12.450> joint<00:01:12.780> tape<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:14.310> get

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a drywall joint tape and you can get

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
a drywall joint tape and you can get
this<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.939> your<00:01:15.509> local<00:01:15.780> hardware<00:01:15.900> store<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this at your local hardware store and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.240 
this at your local hardware store and
it's<00:01:17.400> perfect<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:17.880> its<00:01:18.479> adhesive<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it's perfect because its adhesive so it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
it's perfect because its adhesive so it
sticks<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.240> projects<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> makes<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
sticks to your projects and it makes a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
sticks to your projects and it makes a
really<00:01:22.770> nice<00:01:23.630> background<00:01:24.630> texture<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.259> your

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
really nice background texture to your

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.070 
really nice background texture to your
projects<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> laid<00:01:26.759> some<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.900> right

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
projects so I laid some of that right

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.850 
projects so I laid some of that right
here<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.880> add<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
here and then I add some right here so I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
here and then I add some right here so I
have<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> piece<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.759> vertical<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
have a piece going vertical and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.380 
have a piece going vertical and
horizontal<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:36.000> love<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I add some of the modeling paste up here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.649 
I add some of the modeling paste up here
and<00:01:51.570> throughout<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.829> page<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.570> I
