are<00:01:48.550> five<00:01:48.820> cents<00:01:49.390> we<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.780> chasers<00:01:50.230> as

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
are five cents we have the chasers as

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.740 
are five cents we have the chasers as
you<00:01:50.590> can<00:01:50.740> see<00:01:50.890> they<00:01:51.430> complete<00:01:51.940> these<00:01:52.300> scents

like<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:53.080> example<00:01:53.170> here's<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.710> silver<00:01:53.980> tie

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
like for example here's a silver tie

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.399 
like for example here's a silver tie
because<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.270> tie<00:01:55.420> set<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:55.990> here's<00:01:56.140> an<00:01:56.260> egg

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
because the tie set and here's an egg

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.040 
because the tie set and here's an egg
because<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.740> egg<00:01:56.890> set<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.330> icon<00:01:58.840> goes

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
because the egg set and this icon goes

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.610 
because the egg set and this icon goes
the<00:01:59.140> icon<00:01:59.530> set<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.720> all<00:02:02.230> these<00:02:02.440> are

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
the icon set and so you all these are
