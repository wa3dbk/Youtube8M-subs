00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
salt on top it's pretty strong but then

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.270 
salt on top it's pretty strong but then
towards<00:05:40.199> the<00:05:40.320> end<00:05:40.530> when<00:05:40.830> you<00:05:40.919> start<00:05:41.160> to

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
towards the end when you start to

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.610 
towards the end when you start to
swallow<00:05:41.669> it<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:42.120> tastes<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:42.870> little<00:05:42.900> bit<00:05:43.289> on<00:05:43.470> the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620

sweet<00:05:43.860> side<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.990> was<00:05:46.199> try<00:05:46.440> my<00:05:46.680> pretzel<00:05:47.220> with

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490

that's enough so I can taste it oh I
don't<00:05:56.310> think<00:05:56.639> I<00:05:56.729> like<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.060> cheese<00:05:57.330> part<00:05:57.690> you

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
don't think I like the cheese part you

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.080 
don't think I like the cheese part you
can<00:05:58.740> definitely<00:05:59.130> tell<00:05:59.310> that<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.729> a<00:05:59.820> cheese

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
can definitely tell that it's a cheese

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.120 
can definitely tell that it's a cheese
flavor<00:06:00.570> but<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.440> tastes<00:06:01.800> a<00:06:01.860> lot<00:06:02.070> like

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
flavor but it tastes a lot like

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.659 
flavor but it tastes a lot like
chemicals<00:06:03.470> I'm<00:06:04.470> gonna<00:06:04.650> go<00:06:04.770> back<00:06:04.949> to<00:06:04.979> a<00:06:05.190> pretzel

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
chemicals I'm gonna go back to a pretzel

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.210 
chemicals I'm gonna go back to a pretzel
so<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.150> can<00:06:06.389> wash<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.720> taste<00:06:07.020> out

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
so I can wash that taste out

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.879 
so I can wash that taste out
whoo<00:06:08.970> that<00:06:09.330> was<00:06:09.479> not<00:06:09.660> very<00:06:09.900> good<00:06:12.590> much<00:06:13.590> better

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
whoo that was not very good much better

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.450 
whoo that was not very good much better
much<00:06:14.370> much<00:06:14.910> better<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:16.169> pretzels<00:06:16.620> themselves

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
much much better the pretzels themselves

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.700 
much much better the pretzels themselves
without<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.120> salt<00:06:18.389> are<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:18.690> little<00:06:19.320> bit<00:06:19.470> salty

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
without the salt are a little bit salty

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.860 
without the salt are a little bit salty
so<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.490> definitely<00:06:20.820> don't<00:06:21.210> want<00:06:21.449> to<00:06:21.510> add<00:06:21.630> too

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
so you definitely don't want to add too

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.650 
so you definitely don't want to add too
much<00:06:22.020> salt<00:06:22.080> to<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:22.620> top<00:06:22.860> they<00:06:23.820> also<00:06:24.000> do<00:06:24.389> have

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
much salt to the top they also do have

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.200

quite like a real pretzel it's more like

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.270 
quite like a real pretzel it's more like
bread<00:06:37.830> but<00:06:38.400> it<00:06:38.490> definitely<00:06:39.030> isn't<00:06:39.270> bad<00:06:40.280> well
