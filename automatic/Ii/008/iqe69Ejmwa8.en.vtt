00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi everyone but we end up 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.160
 for a video one of my first 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.170
 videos and i will confess to you something i 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 am a second world war II fan of colo 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.660
 collects models of books 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.539
 models already made models 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 I made books and so on 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.260
 I published a video about Saint Mother 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.119
 the church and so I'll let you know 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 from my second war collection 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 world wide then I'm more in the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.000
 planes there personally I do not deny 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.969
 German airplanes that this aircraft 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.450
 english and american a little cat 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.289
 russia is looking for a new typical tank 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.360
 American puts you in relation not created 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.800
 there are still all the boxes of 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 models 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 so if they are not all letting go 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 build week is so low there 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.290
 what do I mean bah too 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.830
 one of my first models that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.090
 I did it's a deputy spitfire 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.009
 hungary spitfire mk6 english airplanes with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.720
 two machine guns here of course with the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.540
 spicy luxury symbols of science 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.409
 American 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 mk ii b great if we take it we beat 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 heavily armed but she is small 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.110
 bomb the English series fa but I the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.579
 more at home really american I'm not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.810
 why she has plenty of it but nothing 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:54.180
 so here is the American tank 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.570
 looking to reindeer n 81 us to be more 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.360
 specific 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.670
 so even then yes it's my favorite 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.350
 I think it's a super that changes 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.090
 it was me who mounted it and by the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.200
 princess I met is me 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.390
 who says it is at this moment that it is 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.600
 for example 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.790
 so here we see two bombs with pardon 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:19.030
 for visibility four machine guns 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.520
 to your little one is the star 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.830
 american she choice I stuck a 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.690
 little bit upside down every month but 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.600
 voices so some people there he is 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.989
 historic but it is beautiful 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:40.360
 champions of unys end and subtle 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.489
 it is in this plane that those of the ex 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.230
 operated by antoine de saint-exupÃ©ry 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:50.860
 disappeared in this plane in 1944 I know 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.170
 more exactly what date but little 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.340
 near an internship beyond so the sails 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.299
 and I in the region unfortunately broke 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.560
 where will this assembly stop 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.310
 historical because it's the last 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.610
 propeller plane coming who's going to exist 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.739
 because after arrives at 9 am 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.160
 so three thousand six hundred pounds of 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.799
 points still have to make strong and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.790
 very very beautiful a little crazy to ride my 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.380
 titles works so now we're going 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.209
 take an interest in models already made 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.700
 so these two there surely lives some 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:34.660
 thing it goes to the pub it's an armored 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.310
 competition a good German of the coup 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.670
 I can not read or goldsmiths ahmed 9,40 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.590
 he needed it so in Russia in 1942 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:51.160
 So here there there are 2 mg 42 and has a 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.970
 six rockets but fruitful there he 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.019
 frankly 4 euros with the booklet and 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.030
 six leaders were worth beautiful when so the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.750
 gr 1 which is one of the messages the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.750
 handle 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:16.090
 n 16 americans on kate in ardenne en 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:22.690
 1945 and hernandez morize respect there 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.160
 a small decoration the name the money placed the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.600
 name of man who can all 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.330
 doors and 9.5 to 1600 ps psv she to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.040
 cannons of 4 x 12 rooms 70 minutes to 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.260
 what I often have kg but I think 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.880
 without stopping 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:45.940
 yeah that's okay it's not bad at all 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.190
 this little guy battery that's a 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.060
 my first two defeats 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.820
 it is a chariot in italy in the eu and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.600
 also serves a German tank 1944 because 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.400
 that out of the ordinary 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.560
 Here Bozak it rained 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.650
 German lacroix via it's the same 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.500
 workforce description 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.170
 so here I started to be rather 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.300
 little stream york normand what big 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.320
 middle and low match I build in the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.380
 surprise models 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.150
 I wanted to show you later 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.490
 to share my collection no 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.840
 small collections and I tell you to 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.840
 very soon more
