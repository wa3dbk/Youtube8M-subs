my manually sorted order and I can drag

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.910 
my manually sorted order and I can drag
and<00:03:15.060> drop<00:03:15.329> as<00:03:15.599> much<00:03:15.750> as<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.989> want<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.769> will

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.849 
remember this even if I say sort it by
date<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.819> then<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> turn<00:03:22.290> off<00:03:22.410> sorted<00:03:22.739> by<00:03:22.799> date

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.339 
date and then I turn off sorted by date
it<00:03:23.069> goes<00:03:23.190> back<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.549> my<00:03:23.699> manual<00:03:24.599> sorting<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.290> you

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
it goes back to my manual sorting so you

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.809 
it goes back to my manual sorting so you
can't<00:03:25.590> sort<00:03:25.799> by<00:03:25.949> titles<00:03:26.370> or<00:03:26.459> anything<00:03:26.639> like

you<00:03:56.579> could<00:03:56.669> also<00:03:56.819> change<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.510> GPS

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
you could also change the GPS

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.379 
you could also change the GPS
information<00:03:58.349> but<00:03:59.159> it<00:03:59.549> doesn't<00:04:00.030> appear<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.269> be

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
information but it doesn't appear to be

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.879 
information but it doesn't appear to be
a<00:04:00.419> way<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:00.659> do<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.049> currently<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.590> photos

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
a way to do that currently in photos

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.680 
a way to do that currently in photos
hopefully<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.519> will<00:04:02.639> be<00:04:02.760> added<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.359> future

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
hopefully that will be added in a future

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.449

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
might guess you can drag and drop so I

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.159 
might guess you can drag and drop so I
can<00:04:41.340> take<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.580> photo<00:04:41.820> here<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.270> drag<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.050> to

adjustment and hit done and now I can go
in<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:13.159> edit<00:06:14.159> it<00:06:14.490> again<00:06:14.610> because<00:06:15.599> I<00:06:15.659> like<00:06:15.960> how

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
in and edit it again because I like how

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.170 
in and edit it again because I like how
these<00:06:16.349> filters<00:06:16.740> look<00:06:16.949> and<00:06:17.190> copy<00:06:17.820> those

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
these filters look and copy those

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.460 
these filters look and copy those
adjustments<00:06:19.400> and<00:06:20.400> then<00:06:20.639> I<00:06:21.110> can<00:06:22.110> go<00:06:22.259> to<00:06:22.289> another

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
adjustments and then I can go to another

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.749 
adjustments and then I can go to another
photo<00:06:23.159> and<00:06:25.009> apply<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.070> same<00:06:26.520> adjustments

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
photo and apply the same adjustments

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.749 
photo and apply the same adjustments
when<00:06:27.180> I'm<00:06:27.270> in<00:06:27.389> edit<00:06:27.539> mode

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.369 

and<00:06:30.759> will<00:06:31.090> give<00:06:31.210> me<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.419> same<00:06:31.599> result<00:06:31.749> so<00:06:32.169> it's

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
and will give me the same result so it's

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.140 
and will give me the same result so it's
easy<00:06:32.530> to<00:06:32.620> take<00:06:32.860> a<00:06:33.069> set<00:06:33.370> of<00:06:33.550> changes<00:06:33.879> that<00:06:34.090> you

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
easy to take a set of changes that you

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.619 
easy to take a set of changes that you
made<00:06:34.360> and<00:06:34.749> apply<00:06:35.020> them<00:06:35.259> on<00:06:35.499> another<00:06:36.400> image<00:06:36.879> so

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:37.629
