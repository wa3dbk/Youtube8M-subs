00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
just thought it was probably a product

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.500 
just thought it was probably a product
that's<00:00:32.279> gonna<00:00:32.669> take<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.059> money<00:00:33.300> I'm

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that's gonna take your money I'm

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.310 
that's gonna take your money I'm
returning<00:00:34.079> anyways<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:37.040> bought<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.320> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
returning anyways I bought them and this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
returning anyways I bought them and this
what<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.620> look<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:43.820> these<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.969> not

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
what they look like and these are not

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
what they look like and these are not
throwing<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.660> guess<00:00:46.110> there's<00:00:46.350> different<00:00:46.770> kinds

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
throwing I guess there's different kinds

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
throwing I guess there's different kinds
because<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> wraparound<00:00:48.570> pair

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
because this is not the wraparound pair

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
because this is not the wraparound pair
that<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.789> pair<00:00:51.059> when

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that like when you they have a pair when

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.819 
that like when you they have a pair when
you<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.600> glasses<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.469> put<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:52.739> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you have glasses and you can put them on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
you have glasses and you can put them on
top<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> other<00:00:53.370> glasses<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.300> have

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
top of the other glasses and they have

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.170 
top of the other glasses and they have
these<00:00:54.780> where<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:56.370> wear<00:00:56.579> glasses<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
these where you don't wear glasses you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.160 
these where you don't wear glasses you
can<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.600> wear<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.800> I<00:01:00.170> think

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
can just wear them you know like I think

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.219

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
I look pretty cool what you think
anyways<00:01:04.229> these<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
anyways these are the one of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.429 
anyways these are the one of the
better-looking<00:01:06.180> ones<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.020> I've<00:01:07.140> seen

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
better-looking ones that I've seen

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.789 
better-looking ones that I've seen
before<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:09.140> they<00:01:10.140> work<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.500> good

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
before and they work pretty good

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.760 
before and they work pretty good
I<00:01:11.010> mean<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.869> inside<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.200> different<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.710> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I mean I'm inside it's different but I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.969 
I mean I'm inside it's different but I
mean<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.600> outdoors<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.990> mean<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> saw<00:01:16.920> the
