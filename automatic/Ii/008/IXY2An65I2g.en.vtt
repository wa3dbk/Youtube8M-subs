00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.639 
6-speed manual so shift your own gears
it's<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.119> way<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.330> should<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.659> no<00:02:07.840> DSG<00:02:08.440> year

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
it's the way it should be no DSG year

dual clutch manual transmission but we

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.080 
dual clutch manual transmission but we
also<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.769> this<00:02:11.920> s<00:02:12.159> button<00:02:12.489> on<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> console

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
also have this s button on the console

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.039 
also have this s button on the console
which<00:02:13.209> controls<00:02:13.569> some<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> more

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
which controls some of the more

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.350 
which controls some of the more
high-tech<00:02:14.650> elements<00:02:15.099> of<00:02:15.189> this<00:02:15.310> car<00:02:15.580> for

high-tech elements of this car for
example<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.349> s<00:02:17.500> mode<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.099> makes

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
example put it in s mode and it makes

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.190 
example put it in s mode and it makes
the<00:02:18.459> acceleration<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:19.510> aggressive<00:02:20.019> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the acceleration more aggressive the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.350 
the acceleration more aggressive the
throttle<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.769> little<00:02:20.980> more<00:02:21.099> sensitive<00:02:21.760> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
throttle is a little more sensitive and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.880 
throttle is a little more sensitive and
it<00:02:22.810> also<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.140> cause<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.470> magnetic

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it also can cause the magnetic

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.100 
it also can cause the magnetic
suspension<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.849> when<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.510> put<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.900> S

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
suspension that when you put it in S

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.540 
suspension that when you put it in S
mode<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.560> makes<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
mode it makes the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.460 
mode it makes the
quality<00:02:28.060> stiffer<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.750> handles<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.110> corners

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
quality stiffer and handles the corners

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.200 
quality stiffer and handles the corners
better<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:30.100> course<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.730> flip<00:02:30.910> side<00:02:30.940> it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
better of course on the flip side it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.250 
better of course on the flip side it
also<00:02:31.330> makes<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> ride<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.870> little<00:02:31.960> less

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
also makes the ride a little less

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.140 
also makes the ride a little less
comfortable<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.460> s<00:02:33.640> button<00:02:33.880> also

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
comfortable but this s button also

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.090 
comfortable but this s button also
controls<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.900> sport<00:02:35.260> exhaust<00:02:35.410> now<00:02:35.860> that's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
controls the sport exhaust now that's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.400 
controls the sport exhaust now that's
another<00:02:36.910> option<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.570> have<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.990> this<00:02:38.140> car

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
another option that we have in this car

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.680 
another option that we have in this car
$1,500<00:02:39.160> option<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.030> makes<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.390> exhaust

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
$1,500 option that makes the exhaust

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
$1,500 option that makes the exhaust
sound<00:02:40.900> more<00:02:41.200> aggressive<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.130> opens<00:02:42.400> up<00:02:42.520> some

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
sound more aggressive it opens up some

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.280 
sound more aggressive it opens up some
baffles<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.690> get<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.900> really<00:02:44.170> like

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
baffles and you get this really like

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.680 
baffles and you get this really like
roaring<00:02:44.770> sound<00:02:45.130> which<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:46.180> doesn't<00:02:46.360> do<00:02:46.570> much

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
roaring sound which that doesn't do much

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.210 
roaring sound which that doesn't do much
for<00:02:46.870> performance<00:02:47.350> but<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.710> certainly<00:02:47.920> makes

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
for performance but it certainly makes

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.430 
for performance but it certainly makes
you<00:02:48.310> happy<00:02:48.580> now<00:02:49.390> with<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.660> small<00:02:49.930> cabin<00:02:50.350> you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
you happy now with this small cabin you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.710 
you happy now with this small cabin you
might<00:02:50.620> assume<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.100> TT<00:02:51.400> RS<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> two-seater

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
might assume the TT RS is a two-seater

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
might assume the TT RS is a two-seater
but<00:02:53.080> I'm<00:02:53.170> gonna<00:02:53.260> prove<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:53.800> coupe<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
but I'm gonna prove it's a coupe so you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.410 
but I'm gonna prove it's a coupe so you
can<00:02:56.860> see<00:02:57.040> there<00:02:57.220> are<00:02:57.370> back<00:02:57.580> seats<00:02:57.910> here<00:02:58.210> but

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.450 
acceleration now you'll also notice this
engine<00:03:43.420> sits<00:03:43.930> sideways<00:03:44.500> sidesaddle

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
engine sits sideways sidesaddle

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.980 
engine sits sideways sidesaddle
usually<00:03:45.850> this<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> mark<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.600> front-wheel

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
usually this is a mark of a front-wheel

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.770 
usually this is a mark of a front-wheel
drive<00:03:47.020> car<00:03:47.310> but<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.460> TT<00:03:48.760> RS<00:03:48.790> has<00:03:49.300> Quattro

drive car but the TT RS has Quattro
all-wheel<00:03:49.810> drive<00:03:50.260> standard<00:03:50.710> so<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:51.220> doesn't

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
all-wheel drive standard so that doesn't

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.120 
all-wheel drive standard so that doesn't
really<00:03:51.970> matter<00:03:52.150> what's<00:03:53.020> more<00:03:53.470> mediocre<00:03:53.740> about

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
really matter what's more mediocre about

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.980 
really matter what's more mediocre about
this<00:03:54.280> engine<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.820> mileage<00:03:55.209> 18<00:03:55.720> miles<00:03:55.900> per

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
this engine is the mileage 18 miles per

not<00:03:59.260> great<00:03:59.590> pretty<00:03:59.980> average<00:04:00.250> numbers<00:04:00.820> but

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
not great pretty average numbers but

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.780 
not great pretty average numbers but
that's<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.390> really<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.660> point<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.140> car

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.460

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
makes of a dual purpose car this is

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.920 
makes of a dual purpose car this is
something<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.800> MW<00:04:15.340> does<00:04:15.490> really<00:04:15.820> well<00:04:16.150> you

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
something the MW does really well you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.479 
something the MW does really well you
know<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.200> this<00:04:17.260> yeah<00:04:17.620> leave<00:04:17.920> it<00:04:18.040> off<00:04:18.160> sport

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
know and this yeah leave it off sport

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.979 
know and this yeah leave it off sport
mode<00:04:18.670> in<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.060> city<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.510> can<00:04:19.660> drive<00:04:19.810> around

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
mode in the city you can drive around

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.080 
mode in the city you can drive around
drive<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.530> work<00:04:20.590> every<00:04:20.739> day<00:04:20.890> but<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.850> doesn't

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
drive to work every day but it doesn't

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.750 
drive to work every day but it doesn't
work<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:22.270> well<00:04:22.540> in<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.260> car<00:04:23.560> because<00:04:24.040> the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
work so well in this car because the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.460 
work so well in this car because the
suspension<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.450> non<00:04:25.660> sport<00:04:26.020> mode<00:04:26.169> never

suspension in non sport mode never

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.130 
suspension in non sport mode never
really<00:04:26.860> gets<00:04:27.310> comfortable<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.180> engine

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
really gets comfortable and engine

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.659 
really gets comfortable and engine
always<00:04:29.290> remains<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.770> little<00:04:29.890> touchy<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.460> little

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
always remains a little touchy a little

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.000 
always remains a little touchy a little
hard<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.000> control<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.450> traffic<00:04:32.290> on<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.830> fun

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
hard to control in traffic on the fun

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.460 
hard to control in traffic on the fun
curvy<00:04:33.340> roads<00:04:33.520> like<00:04:33.760> I'm<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.030> right<00:04:34.210> now<00:04:34.470> you

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
curvy roads like I'm on right now you

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.780 
curvy roads like I'm on right now you
can<00:04:35.560> really<00:04:35.740> get<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.890> sense<00:04:35.950> of<00:04:36.250> how<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.580> car

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
can really get a sense of how this car

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.340 
can really get a sense of how this car
is<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.000> post<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.390> handle<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.810> places<00:04:38.169> it's

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
is to post the handle the places it's

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.680 
is to post the handle the places it's
supposed<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.000> fun<00:04:40.390> driving

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
supposed to be and this is fun driving

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.640 
supposed to be and this is fun driving
around

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
around

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.430 
around
yeah<00:04:42.280> suspension<00:04:43.270> really<00:04:43.479> just<00:04:43.810> handles

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
yeah suspension really just handles

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.719 
yeah suspension really just handles
these<00:04:44.560> corners<00:04:44.860> nicely<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:45.400> get<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.550> nice

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
these corners nicely and you get a nice

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.860 
these corners nicely and you get a nice
sense<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.720> rotation<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.620> turns<00:04:47.919> but

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
sense of rotation in the turns but

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.060 
sense of rotation in the turns but
there's<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> couple<00:04:50.050> things<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.470> don't<00:04:50.800> really

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
there's a couple things I don't really

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.070 
there's a couple things I don't really
like<00:04:51.370> about<00:04:51.639> this<00:04:51.790> car<00:04:52.000> as<00:04:52.330> far<00:04:52.540> as<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.780> sports

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
like about this car as far as the sports

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.920 
like about this car as far as the sports
car<00:04:53.350> goes<00:04:53.560> one<00:04:53.919> of<00:04:54.729> that<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.419> fact<00:04:55.720> it's

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
car goes one of that is the fact it's

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.659 
car goes one of that is the fact it's
got<00:04:56.080> this<00:04:56.199> electric<00:04:56.590> power<00:04:56.830> steering<00:04:57.130> system

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
got this electric power steering system

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.270 
got this electric power steering system
that<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.630> not<00:04:58.780> tuned<00:04:59.169> all<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.620> great<00:04:59.949> I

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
that it's not tuned all that great I

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.430 
that it's not tuned all that great I
don't<00:05:01.000> know<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.510> turn<00:05:01.840> in<00:05:01.990> isn't<00:05:02.260> very

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
don't know it the turn in isn't very

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.490 
don't know it the turn in isn't very
tight<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:03.490> don't<00:05:03.639> feel<00:05:03.910> a<00:05:03.940> lot<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.500> response

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
tight you don't feel a lot of response

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.040 
tight you don't feel a lot of response
like<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:05.889> do<00:05:06.010> in<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:07.540> know<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.810> best

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
like you do in the you know the best

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.560 
like you do in the you know the best
systems<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.560> I've<00:05:08.650> tested<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:10.240> car<00:05:10.449> just

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
systems that I've tested this car just

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.350 
systems that I've tested this car just
remains<00:05:10.930> kind<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.229> fade<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.850> doesn't<00:05:13.150> have

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
remains kind of fade and it doesn't have

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.230 
remains kind of fade and it doesn't have
the<00:05:13.720> sharp<00:05:14.470> turnin<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.190> would<00:05:15.310> really

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
the sharp turnin that I would really

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.360 
the sharp turnin that I would really
want<00:05:16.600> from<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:17.080> good<00:05:17.590> steering<00:05:17.860> system<00:05:18.220> in<00:05:18.340> a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
want from a good steering system in a

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.210 
want from a good steering system in a
sports<00:05:18.669> car<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.389> I<00:05:19.570> think<00:05:19.810> I'd<00:05:20.650> wait<00:05:20.889> till<00:05:20.919> the

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
sports car and I think I'd wait till the

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.590 
sports car and I think I'd wait till the
Audi<00:05:21.310> engineers<00:05:21.760> have<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:21.940> chance<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.330> tune

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
Audi engineers have a chance to tune

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.320 
Audi engineers have a chance to tune
that<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.900> little<00:05:23.229> bit<00:05:23.380> better<00:05:24.090> another<00:05:25.090> thing

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
that a little bit better another thing

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.240 
that a little bit better another thing
I'm<00:05:25.419> not<00:05:25.539> crazy<00:05:25.870> about<00:05:26.020> is<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.590> gate<00:05:26.860> on<00:05:27.100> this

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
I'm not crazy about is the gate on this

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.909 
I'm not crazy about is the gate on this
manual<00:05:27.460> transmission<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.960> gate<00:05:29.199> isn't<00:05:29.470> quite

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
manual transmission the gate isn't quite

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.159 
manual transmission the gate isn't quite
as<00:05:30.160> tight<00:05:30.490> as<00:05:30.699> it<00:05:30.850> could<00:05:31.060> be<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:31.479> really<00:05:31.720> want<00:05:32.080> to

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
as tight as it could be I really want to

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.320 
as tight as it could be I really want to

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
be able to feel it's smoothly going each

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.750 
be able to feel it's smoothly going each

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.840

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
I'm not sure I would include that

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.330

throw<00:06:08.220> that<00:06:08.460> on<00:06:08.490> there<00:06:08.850> but<00:06:09.510> ultimately<00:06:09.690> I

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
throw that on there but ultimately I

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.890 
throw that on there but ultimately I
