00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
Scott Snyder nails the landing I think

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.780 
Scott Snyder nails the landing I think
he<00:05:18.990> nails<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.590> perfectly<00:05:20.040> especially<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.670> this

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
he nails it perfectly especially in this

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.460 
he nails it perfectly especially in this
one<00:05:20.970> more<00:05:21.240> so<00:05:21.420> than<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.690> other<00:05:21.840> story<00:05:22.140> arcs

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
one more so than the other story arcs

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.150 
one more so than the other story arcs
but<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.730> think<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.540> if<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:25.500> are<00:05:25.710> curious
