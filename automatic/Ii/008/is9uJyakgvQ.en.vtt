00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.760
 I'm probably not cold here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.760
 only endure 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.420
 I have a problem I have so far 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.760
 not changed much fun 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 hello I'm the one I'll reveal 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.449
 me and my many friends short 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.070
 introduces in this video 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.470
 I mainly focus on our features 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.480
 and our structure 1 in the description 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.530
 of the video you will find an eye one 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.880
 short summary with us 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 Generally one can say that me and 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.770
 my many friends in the catalyst 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.280
 Cell 6 means we were something 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.800
 wonderful useful calls mostly 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.130
 is it as stranzl as star 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.829
 is a nutrient missing 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.070
 different substances and 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.659
 every wheel also has a door around it 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.570
 You can understand these better 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.939
 question as small locks and presents 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.039
 a wild meadow closed to cash 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.530
 One also speaks of the key lock 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.319
 principle of further we are the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.000
 he does not mean that means he succumbs 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:32.860
 so in your items 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.720
 thus it is usable to metabolize 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.829
 So there are many different ones 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.450
 decided 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.030
 and again have different 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.860
 tasks around me every hour for hours 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.560
 to describe the individual process 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 they let us in six classes whether 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.330
 she totally catalyzes this class 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.209
 Reactions Reactions and Chemical 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.209
 Reactions on each phones and earnings 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.720
 class 214 this class transmits atom 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.150
 Brocken from one to the other substrate 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.920
 she is the smallest particle ever 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.130
 gives 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.930
 class 3 hydro long this class 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.620
 goes under the use of water 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:29.560
 Dry the problems are more 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:33.670
 atoms or ions class four 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.670
 or are many classic reacted 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.170
 split or are their simple ones 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.050
 substrates more complex substrate class 5 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.700
 the as well as lawn 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.920
 this class accelerates the conversion 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.160
 of chemical compounds in 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.380
 chemical young teacher are chemical 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 connections the same building blocks 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.690
 but have arranged differently 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.680
 red / dpa sing the class realized 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.400
 Become a simple substrate break 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.910
 doings 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 the difference is later at http 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.480
 better and i will do that with leon 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.700
 won 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.670
 Learn more about the song and up 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:28.130
 I'm special student in the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.580
 able to be counted in several classes 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.500
 become 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.290
 I hate and main task yet 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.200
 no one short together not with one 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.819
 receptive food and we control the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.970
 predominant part of the biochemical 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.330
 Reactions of biochemical reactions 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.140
 for example, the verification is the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.019
 doping ideas approaches the alba 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.170
 would have the dna transaction the 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.230
 Overriding the most important glucose 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.030
 Supplier Candidates of the Tea Party Plus 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.959
 in the preparation of 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.090
 this would have the production and the 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.570
 photogenic appearance of them 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.570
 managed to break 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.819
 build up at the bottom 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.450
 general shows with us in two 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.549
 categories from first kimono more the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:24.669
 consists of a chain of pharmacies 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:27.010
 2 the oligomeric klaus more played and 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.050
 sometimes we end up together 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.030
 this one receives multi entry complete 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 there is also the exile opposition 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.330
 It is called the implementation of the idea of one 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.340
 chips the reduction throw one 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.340
 inhibitor Namibia performed 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.690
 second, the relevant media and 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:01.590
 driving yourself as a cloudy who 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:06.760
 remains at every point of resistance 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:09.330
 he or she can continue by mobile phone 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.330
 Little is necessary if you 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.330
 created 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.580
 Worth knowing is that will be my many 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.430
 friends are very adaptable 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.330
 that is when the substrates 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.050
 narrow 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.789
 Let 's just remember, as well 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.009
 do not just limit ourselves to 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.800
 biochemical reactions respectively 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.740
 the metabolism also offers a 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.539
 signal transduction in passing of 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.550
 information within a cell 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.680
 involved 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:47.069
 the further are also for the distribution 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:53.780
 of the organism involved 99 ii 4 1 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:58.169
 since this is not even a chance 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.740
 random potatoes so if you are 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.860
 you dare 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.030
 then he could be another point 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.659
 the snow falls 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.460
 That's when the activity of the enzyme 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.500
 diminished or absent 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.969
 This can be used to train 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.979
 serious illnesses 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:23.250
 hypersensitivity or alami or 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:26.190
 development delays that were the 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.360
 general facts about us I feel 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.360
 I hope it helped me 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.869
 No
