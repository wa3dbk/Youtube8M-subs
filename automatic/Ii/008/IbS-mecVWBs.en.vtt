killed off the life cycle that's why you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
killed off the life cycle that's why you
want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> go<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.299> 10<00:01:06.600> days<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
I've made the mistake in years past by
spraying<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.960> they're<00:01:34.110> under<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> lights

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
spraying when they're under the lights

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
spraying when they're under the lights
and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> splash<00:01:35.759> gets<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.210> under<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and then the splash gets up under the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.980 
and then the splash gets up under the
lights<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:38.509> Dolls<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
lights and it really Dolls them and it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.260 
lights and it really Dolls them and it
blocks<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> lumens<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.890> Kelvin<00:01:41.280> numbers<00:01:42.090> from

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
blocks the lumens in Kelvin numbers from

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
blocks the lumens in Kelvin numbers from
it<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.960> soak<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> top<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:44.009> go

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it but just soak the top down don't go

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.840 
it but just soak the top down don't go
crazy<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> again<00:01:45.360> these<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.850> peat

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
crazy with it again these are the peat

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.830 
crazy with it again these are the peat
moss<00:01:49.670> cells<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.149> they're<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> absorb

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
moss cells so they're going to absorb

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
moss cells so they're going to absorb
the<00:01:52.079> water<00:01:52.520> when<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.390> on

spray underneath of your cells and that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
spray underneath of your cells and that
