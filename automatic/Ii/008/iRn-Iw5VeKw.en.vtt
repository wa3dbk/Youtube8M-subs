00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 what a dream with the signing of his work 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.400
 pixel a lot of people asked me 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.250
 technical how to clean my insert 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.690
 electronic product here so we're going to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.490
 answer that question or at least 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.580
 tell them how I do to clean 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.719
 my own gadgets put the intro 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 and what they will need 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.650
 probably things they can find 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 in your house except maybe this we have 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.029
 here alcohol 96 degrees as you realize 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 well 96 degrees or 70 good because 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.830
 it just says 96 percent here but 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.570
 good the grade of the same after here 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 we have a microfiber cloth what can 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.440
 buy in a supermarket I will go side 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 I bought a good one really they are not very 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.629
 cheap maybe you get 100 pesos a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 cloths and Argentine companies but it's going 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.050
 to last a lot of time what can 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.700
 throw in washing machine and washed so not 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.620
 be afraid to spend on this order is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.989
 that is broken is spent and is already can not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 use more later without sir is a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.840
 video toothbrush tooth 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 old people do not have to buy one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 new as long as they are finite bristles 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 notice that they are finite and soft, not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 those hard and horrible things that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 gum a piece of cotton and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.570
 obviously a product in this case 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.769
 we are going to have for example here the engine or 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.270
 the ex motorcycle 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.070
 let's do to clean the good 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.469
 let's see what alcohol we have 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.469
 what to put with the cotton logically if 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.929
 not for what I had here we put very very 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.149
 little alcohol or just so that 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.679
 it's just humid and no more than that 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.299
 because because if we press it and start 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.039
 to drip can get to get through 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.990
 example in some area such as the 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.030
 speakers or the microphone with this we go 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.219
 to clean the screen that is glass 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.860
 we passed just like that and ready not much more 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.630
 let's realize that cotton 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.429
 it's going to be a little dirty or grayish 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.319
 and it is very dirty and very dirty 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.890
 full of fat notice that I'm just 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.780
 going slowly if the screen is very 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.179
 dirty previously that is before 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.009
 spend cotton first look at blowing 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.289
 the phone because it might arrive 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.909
 to have some sand and at the time 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.679
 which you grab will be flour and what 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.569
 crawl scratched all the glass so 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.849
 Look first to take at least 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.099
 a suffered or simply to blow the 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.899
 phone screen to let them go 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.819
 those particles of dust or sand that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.969
 they can possibly be there and 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.289
 ready after the alcohol 96 degrees to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.700
 that we can not use in addition to 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.100
 the screen for example in this case I 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.830
 I have a vinyl here on the back cover 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.960
 the motorcycle ex to this type of materials them 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.760
 we can pass cotton with alcohol without 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.770
 no kind of problems like 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.450
 as we did with glass that is 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.820
 these materials are not going to present 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.780
 no problem should not stop or 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040
 nothing like that simply that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.200
 we are taking society out of shape 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.000
 calm and soft now for example 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.510
 let's imagine that we have a product 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.040
 like this one that is the bch I already x that 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 for example that we have very sharp edges 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.610
 similar to samsung phones by 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.320
 example the galaxy s3 is to say to be 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.420
 one with an edge that mimics segmented in 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 plastic reality painted here does not 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.170
 we can pass the cotton on top very 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.120
 strong because we're going to get the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.620
 we're going to paint it off, maybe not 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 we do it at the first time but 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.100
 eventually we will take it out or if 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.120
 we are very strong going to leave a 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.920
 bit after will not be a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.630
 part of it is painted and another is not and it's going to 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.570
 be obviously horrible then for 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.500
 that cotton with alcohol is not used 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.710
 same for any other surface 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.720
 painted bright is to say the painting the 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.180
 will be moving logically because it is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.100
 alcohol and also on top if it is not 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.810
 remove it will leave a lot more opaque 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.790
 so for this kind of thing not 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.950
 they have to be materials that already have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.640
 its own color because of the material and not 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.250
 because if 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.300
 painting later in the factory then here 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.370
 also the edges we will be able to 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.830
 clean with the same thing or with cotton and 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.240
 a little bit of alcohol remember with very 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.130
 little amount of alcohol notice that it 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.110
 dry very quickly, nothing happens if we 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.030
 there are some spots of alcohol here 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.980
 in front of the screen do not have 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.510
 afraid to give the camera very slowly 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.340
 that is to the camera glass always and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.690
 when it's glass again look no 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.330
 will press too much so that it does not 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.070
 put no particles or a little bit 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.570
 of alcohol vapor inside the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.830
 camera and then we have steam inside 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.750
 because it would be horrible and the same with the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.489
 speaker then once this is done 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.440
 let's see what we use the cloth for 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.940
 of microfiber good when we have this 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.380
 Type of surfaces are not painted 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.090
 here if we are going to directly pass the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.220
 microfiber cloth 'microfiber cloth 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.160
 it's just super super soft not to leave 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.110
 waste and over clean very very well is 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.180
 say creeps the whole society with 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.800
 the same instead of moving it then 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.540
 for that we are going to use it for 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.160
 Bands and first let's drink alcohol and 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.170
 then let's move on if we want the cloth 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.850
 microfiber in this case here now we go 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.440
 to see that if they are not good to see if no 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.549
 that they confer and that they are there there as 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.380
 a few small stripes that remained 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.209
 residual alcohol we do for 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.460
 we aspire simply remove 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.800
 we make 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.240
 against the phone against the screen and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.740
 we gently cloth 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.440
 microfiber and you're done, we see that the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.789
 screen is completely clean without 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.740
 no type of waste or anything for the 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.090
 If your style microfiber cloth stops 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.979
 racing do not worry eventually it 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.630
 it's going to fall only as it 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.569
 go finishing drying and now 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.430
 we have here the toothbrush mister 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.050
 so let's use some 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.970
 they will imagine they grab the toothbrush 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.580
 says a lie we grab the brush 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.780
 teeth and let's move very smoothly 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.190
 that can be done before or after 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.680
 depending on how much you want to 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.389
 clean again we will go very 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.949
 only through all the slits and zones 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.810
 in which we can not arrive with a 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.520
 Hyssop with a piece of cotton as per 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.099
 example here the microphone hole 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.780
 very slowly we're going to move on there 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.430
 to also pass here in the part of the 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.320
 speaker is a very very very slit 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.690
 small obviously depending on your 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.949
 product of your gadget will vary this 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.990
 it will not always be exactly the same 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.190
 but they will be able to clean it very 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.750
 easily because the sows are going to 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.789
 enter are finite are soft they are not going to 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.139
 damage eyes do not do a lot of pressure 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.870
 for example here with the microphone as 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.669
 not to bother the socket is not 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.470
 microphone soldier simply something 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.820
 slowly soft as to take out the 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.890
 dust 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.230
 what is this done we can 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.120
 touch the screen we go again the 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.620
 microfiber cloth this stayed with everything 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.420
 the dust and the phone is left 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.490
 completely clean also we can not 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.800
 use for connectors again with 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.390
 Extreme care not to damage the connector is 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.460
 to say always that we do it by hand with 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.960
 care and the truth that there is not much more 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.520
 science nor much more secret to 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.590
 clean a product do not have to 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.570
 necessarily be only for 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.550
 phones or tablets can be for 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.830
 example as for loaders notice that 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.300
 here I have a canon charger and here 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.400
 It is full of dust and I can not get to 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.650
 no part of these corners by 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.620
 example with a cotton he agonized when he 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.510
 he passed his toothbrush like this 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.160
 quiet that once you get all 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.620
 the dust do not have to take out all the 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.970
 surface dust is to say no no 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.250
 nothing like that happens and they just have 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.840
 than lifting it from the surface because 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.140
 is usually stuck then then 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.190
 simply blowing is going to be like that 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.420
 since there is all the dust was heavy 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.800
 after we pass the handkerchief he goes to 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.650
 lift everything but the important thing is 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.240
 just lift it with the brush 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.160
 teeth look how fast we clean 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.780
 this is a pass to the brush where 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.720
 we can wash afterwards as we finish 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.610
 with soap with what they want 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.590
 a toolbox and you're ready 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.540
 to be able to use it again with a 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.220
 next cleaning I repeat once again no 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.020
 there's a lot more science look at the part 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.070
 more important and more delicate is that of 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.840
 alcohol theme 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.150
 remember to put a small amount of alcohol 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.950
 preferable to go putting little by little and 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.600
 stay with little amount of alcohol to 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.070
 passed from one and that they are targeting a 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.110
 drop inside the microphone and that after 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.280
 the microphone does not work anymore or that 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.020
 a time does not work for them until it 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.940
 dry completely so go 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.650
 calm with that and see what 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.180
 so many forces press the surface 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.670
 if it is painted for example for 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.900
 do not overshadow it over time so said 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.640
 all this tell me below in the 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.600
 comments if you want more supra tips if 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.860
 once it occurred to them that they 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.260
 would like us to show you tell me 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.880
 also if this one served them or not send us 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.250
 photos videos what they want because 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.330
 we like to see what they do with 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.010
 all these things that we 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.050
 we say here in video technicians afis 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.050
 call and see you in future videos 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.080
 you still have not subscribed and to touch a 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.580
 button 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.580
 you have to be right
