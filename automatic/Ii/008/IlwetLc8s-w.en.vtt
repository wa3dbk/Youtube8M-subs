00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
up into four pieces of six inch by 12

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.490 
up into four pieces of six inch by 12
inch<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> here's<00:00:26.220> three<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.930> one

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that I've already wired up so it should

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.120 
that I've already wired up so it should
like<00:00:30.750> look<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.619> you're<00:00:31.710> done<00:00:31.830> but

use these scissors to cut it as long as

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.040 
use these scissors to cut it as long as
you<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.730> sharp<00:00:39.149> scissors<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.870> okay

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.930 

razor<00:00:46.050> blade<00:00:46.410> put<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> little<00:00:47.190> extra<00:00:47.550> tape<00:00:47.760> on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
razor blade put a little extra tape on

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
razor blade put a little extra tape on
it<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> basically<00:00:50.129> there's<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.610> pieces<00:00:51.739> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
it so basically there's two pieces of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.220 
it so basically there's two pieces of
the<00:00:52.890> smart<00:00:53.129> film<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.090> our<00:00:54.690> two<00:00:55.020> pieces

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the smart film and then our two pieces

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
the smart film and then our two pieces
of<00:00:55.260> plastic<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.190> chemicals

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of plastic and then like just chemicals

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.090 
of plastic and then like just chemicals
in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> middle<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:58.890> razor

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
in the middle so you get your razor

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:20.440 
in the middle so you get your razor
blade<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.370> between<00:00:59.730> those

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.359 

a<00:01:20.479> few<00:01:20.990> things<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.260> notice<00:01:21.590> from<00:01:21.770> our<00:01:21.890> film<00:01:22.130> it

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
a few things to notice from our film it

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.289 
a few things to notice from our film it
runs<00:01:22.670> off<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:23.439> 110<00:01:24.439> volts<00:01:24.890> AC<00:01:25.280> or<00:01:25.610> DC<00:01:25.820> doesn't

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
runs off of 110 volts AC or DC doesn't

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.710 
runs off of 110 volts AC or DC doesn't
matter<00:01:30.159> it<00:01:31.159> doesn't<00:01:31.490> react<00:01:32.000> well<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.299> water

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
matter it doesn't react well with water

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.639 
matter it doesn't react well with water
or<00:01:33.020> moisture<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.799> have<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.280> waterproof<00:01:34.939> it

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
or moisture so you have to waterproof it

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.020 
or moisture so you have to waterproof it
between<00:01:36.649> like<00:01:36.950> two<00:01:37.100> pieces<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.399> plexi<00:01:37.880> if

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
between like two pieces of plexi if

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.480 
between like two pieces of plexi if
you're<00:01:38.240> using<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.659> outside<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:43.100> almost<00:01:43.340> to

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
you're using it outside it's almost to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:54.389 
you're using it outside it's almost to
be<00:01:43.610> better

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.550 

it's<00:01:54.820> better<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.180> use<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.329> sharp<00:01:55.930> razor<00:01:56.110> blade

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
it's better to use a sharp razor blade

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:24.630 
it's better to use a sharp razor blade
for<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.640> get<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> sure<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.240> cut

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.750 

so<00:02:25.240> now<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.690> some<00:02:25.870> rubbing<00:02:26.140> alcohol<00:02:26.760> and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
so now you can some rubbing alcohol and

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.690 
so now you can some rubbing alcohol and
a<00:02:27.880> rag

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:47.750 

clean<00:02:34.330> off<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.690> side

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:03.350 

so<00:02:48.330> now<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:48.989> pretty<00:02:49.200> clear

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.060 

this<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.050> aluminum<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.790> not<00:03:06.000> aluminum<00:03:06.330> copper

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
this is aluminum are not aluminum copper

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:51.020 
this is aluminum are not aluminum copper
with<00:03:08.070> an<00:03:08.220> adhesive<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> back

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.480 

um<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:52.110> that's<00:03:52.500> pretty<00:03:52.680> much<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:53.070> I'm<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.430> to

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
um so that's pretty much it I'm going to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.890 
um so that's pretty much it I'm going to
test<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.820> with<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:55.070> 12<00:03:56.070> volt<00:03:56.130> battery<00:03:56.580> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
test it with this 12 volt battery and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.340 
test it with this 12 volt battery and
inverter<00:03:58.190> B<00:03:59.190> cells<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.640> Berger<00:04:00.260> through<00:04:01.260> our

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
inverter B cells and Berger through our

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.910 
inverter B cells and Berger through our
company

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.160 

it's<00:04:06.430> coming<00:04:06.700> out<00:04:06.850> at<00:04:07.000> 110<00:04:07.480> volts<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.990> gives

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
it's coming out at 110 volts so it gives

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.470 
it's coming out at 110 volts so it gives
you<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> good<00:04:08.470> shock<00:04:08.910> I've<00:04:09.910> been<00:04:10.090> shocked<00:04:10.330> if

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
you a good shock I've been shocked if

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:22.890 
you a good shock I've been shocked if
you<00:04:10.570> trance<00:04:10.810> by<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:14.640> if<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.760> touch<00:04:15.970> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:37.050 

it's

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.110 

so<00:04:37.960> now<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:39.070> need<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.340> touch<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.730> two<00:04:39.880> wires

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
so now you need to touch the two wires

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.870 
so now you need to touch the two wires
so<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.530> have<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.710> few<00:04:41.950> different<00:04:42.220> all<00:04:42.400> to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
so you have a few different all to

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:54.490 
so you have a few different all to
options<00:04:43.330> here<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.960> solder<00:04:50.320> it

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.560 

working

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:45.179 

use<00:05:00.260> another<00:05:00.470> piece<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.130> copper

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:54.830 

and<00:05:45.610> polarity<00:05:46.419> doesn't<00:05:46.599> matter<00:05:46.899> here<00:05:48.209> apply

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.820 

one<00:05:55.350> of<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.470> reasons<00:05:55.770> why<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.890> do<00:05:56.040> it<00:05:56.250> this<00:05:56.520> way

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
one of the reasons why I do it this way

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.350 
one of the reasons why I do it this way
is<00:05:58.830> because<00:05:59.040> if<00:05:59.310> you<00:05:59.460> solder<00:05:59.700> it<00:05:59.910> straight<00:06:00.210> on

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
is because if you solder it straight on

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.240 
is because if you solder it straight on
here<00:06:00.720> sometimes<00:06:01.380> you<00:06:01.440> mess<00:06:01.680> up<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.980> smart

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
here sometimes you mess up the smart

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.530 
here sometimes you mess up the smart
film<00:06:02.460> because<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.850> heat<00:06:03.060> from<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.330> solder

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
film because the heat from the solder

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.330 
film because the heat from the solder
gun

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.130 

so<00:06:09.880> dunno<00:06:10.090> like<00:06:10.330> this<00:06:10.540> what<00:06:10.810> I'm<00:06:10.870> going<00:06:10.990> to<00:06:11.020> do

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
so dunno like this what I'm going to do

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.720 
so dunno like this what I'm going to do
is<00:06:11.260> put<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.560> little<00:06:11.740> piece<00:06:11.920> of<00:06:12.130> solder<00:06:12.340> and

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
is put the little piece of solder and

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.580 
is put the little piece of solder and
connect<00:06:13.060> this<00:06:13.180> joint<00:06:13.570> it's<00:06:14.080> actually<00:06:14.440> already

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
connect this joint it's actually already

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.780 
connect this joint it's actually already
on<00:06:14.830> there<00:06:15.010> pretty<00:06:15.190> tight<00:06:15.280> because<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.730> the

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
on there pretty tight because of the

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.070 
on there pretty tight because of the
adhesive<00:06:16.000> but<00:06:16.240> if<00:06:16.360> you<00:06:16.420> connect<00:06:16.660> that<00:06:16.780> joint

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
adhesive but if you connect that joint

00:06:17.080 --> 00:07:03.510 
adhesive but if you connect that joint
then<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.680> comes<00:06:18.220> really<00:06:18.490> strong

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.460 

what's<00:07:04.520> it<00:07:04.730> but<00:07:05.120> well<00:07:05.600> i<00:07:05.720> guess<00:07:05.840> i'll<00:07:05.990> solder

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
what's it but well i guess i'll solder

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:23.089 
what's it but well i guess i'll solder
on<00:07:06.800> this<00:07:06.920> video

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:27.480 

look

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.790 

so<00:07:28.030> now<00:07:28.150> you<00:07:28.210> can<00:07:28.419> see<00:07:28.600> the<00:07:28.750> joints<00:07:29.110> are<00:07:29.229> a<00:07:29.500> lot

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
so now you can see the joints are a lot

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.770 
so now you can see the joints are a lot
stronger<00:07:30.100> from<00:07:30.880> here<00:07:31.090> you<00:07:31.210> can<00:07:31.360> put<00:07:31.539> tape

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
stronger from here you can put tape

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.890 
stronger from here you can put tape
clear<00:07:32.380> tape<00:07:32.590> across<00:07:32.860> the<00:07:33.039> top<00:07:33.250> or<00:07:34.000> like

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
clear tape across the top or like

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.290 
clear tape across the top or like
electrical<00:07:35.319> tape<00:07:35.530> makes<00:07:36.490> it<00:07:36.639> even<00:07:36.880> stronger

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
electrical tape makes it even stronger

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.360 
electrical tape makes it even stronger
and<00:07:37.780> also<00:07:38.099> makes<00:07:39.099> it<00:07:39.160> so<00:07:39.220> you<00:07:39.310> don't

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.370 
and also makes it so you don't

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.620 
and also makes it so you don't
accidentally<00:07:39.880> shock<00:07:40.090> yourself<00:07:40.449> and<00:07:40.569> you

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:40.630 
accidentally shock yourself and you

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:47.219 
accidentally shock yourself and you
touch<00:07:40.810> it<00:07:41.910> but<00:07:42.910> that's<00:07:43.000> it<00:07:45.419> so<00:07:46.419> once<00:07:46.750> again<00:07:46.900> for

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:47.229 
touch it but that's it so once again for

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.200 
touch it but that's it so once again for
this<00:07:47.319> auction<00:07:47.560> it<00:07:47.949> doesn't<00:07:48.639> they<00:07:48.819> don't<00:07:48.970> come

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.210 
this auction it doesn't they don't come

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.240 
this auction it doesn't they don't come
pre-cut<00:07:49.810> you're<00:07:50.139> going<00:07:50.259> to<00:07:50.349> get<00:07:50.500> this<00:07:50.680> big

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.250 
pre-cut you're going to get this big

00:07:51.250 --> 00:08:03.180 
pre-cut you're going to get this big
piece<00:07:57.210> yeah<00:07:58.500> 12<00:07:59.500> inch<00:07:59.740> by<00:07:59.949> 24<00:08:00.310> inch<00:08:01.979> some<00:08:02.979> some
