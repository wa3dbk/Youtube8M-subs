00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.219
 who thinks most speaks of 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.179
 state caring 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.539

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.710
 for a new draft constitution 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.029
 instability in the end 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.170

 interest for peace and stability 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.470
 Kyrgyzstan for prosperity for 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.020
 integrity of Kazakhstan so that 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.370

 Probably our new new one performed 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.370
 power 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.760

 polling stations came over 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.750
 half of the population of the republic and almost 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.380
 all voted deputy 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.520
 according to preliminary data 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 number of voters 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.200
 is 800 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 5771 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.250
 under this questions and puts it will be 9 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.500

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.960
 attention by voters 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810
 constitutional change she 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.660
 provides for a change of presidential 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.579
 form of government on parliamentary 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.159
 so the state will 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 manage no chapter aston 20 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.640

 the parties came to the selenium house 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.229
 the idea the people thereby put 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.600
 fat point on the era 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.940
 authoritarian couple 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.020
 governing body 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.970
 the third question in the referendum was 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 endowing otunbayeva roses 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.250
 presidential powers to the end 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.700
 2011 so the referendum would 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.870

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.320
 a woman president pass them 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020
 we are a percentage of people 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.740
 want to 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.050
 recover from these all severe injury 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.399

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.069
 in the folk door and we will do our best 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.569

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.999
 to 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.849
 live up to hope 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:22.779
 of our 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.329
 merciful 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.939
 great people 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.389
 what political allies will choose 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.790
 The new chapter was not announced however 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.619
 dissatisfied with their politics rose 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.150
 Otunbayeva Osh found the Kremlin police 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.879
 Dmitry Medvedev's reaction to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.400
 referendum results coming 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.859
 contrary to previously declared support 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.769
 new government building 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.709
 u in Kyrgyzstan 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.510
 there is a whole range of possibilities 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.569
 including the most unpleasant 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.989
 opportunities right up to the collapse of the state 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.319
 and in order to prevent 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.559
 similar script 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.979
 required strong good 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.599
 organized power 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.810
 However, the current government in the face of roses 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.379
 Otunbayeva and her party 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.799
 does not seem weak international 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.489
 thirty-one observers 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.719
 the parties agreed to organize 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.599
 democratic rose referendum 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.189
 Otunbayeva succeeded and most importantly did not come true 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.629
 Kremlin predictions and possible attacks 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.829
 only small ones are disturbed 100 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.620
