00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.730
 hello everyone in this video I want to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 tell you about the export that is about 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.910
 tony milled products care 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.750
 of the skin and are specific to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.300
 combat the dots dots the points 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.360
 black all the problems we have 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.990
 on the skin then if you are interested in seeing 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.220
 how it works on video so good 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:51.840
 What I'm going to do is talk about each 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.730
 One and saying what they are and what they are 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.250
 use and then I 'm going to apply so that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 you see the effect or filaments so that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.660
 you can see the final effect well 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.330
 you have to see more or less how it is 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.310
 the normal natural for you to see the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.140
 effect that gets in once I get 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.890
 have applied our products as 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.920
 you see my nose has pretty pores 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.930
 dilated I do not have many black spots 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.820
 my problem is basically not the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 black dots are more points 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.360
 dilated the first product of the trio of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.369
 tony moli cosmetics intended for 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.430
 combat the problems of pores is 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.520
 the white egg as you see is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.270
 the cute as always you know that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.330
 Koreans work aesthetics a lot 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.170
 of cosmetics then it's an egg 2 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 They are egg shaped 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.729
 it's a nice white color this 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 when the boat is finished you can break it 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.210
 and here it is assumed that there is a seed 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.030
 so that dante is an account but the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.820
 case is this this is the first one is a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.690
 Exfoliating I'll open it for you to see 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.000
 the appearance has the cap of the typical 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.220
 you smell super good but well I have that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.280
 a little but not that it smells great I think 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.090
 what you see is a product that is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.209
 transparent and that has like 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.130
 degrees orange granules which are 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.900
 those responsible for the exploration 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.380
 mechanical that it produces is an exfoliant 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.120
 so now this what you do is 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.610
 you take a small amount is although it is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.620
 a gel you have to this texture well 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.170
 quite dense as you see veis has caught 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.660
 there is a quantity and I know it does not fall what 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.150
 apply in the nose after entering 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.489
 contact with the fat of the nose is 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.349
 becomes more white as an exfoliant 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.680
 mechanical what you have to do is 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.810
 be there for a while 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.390
 all the granules pass through the skin 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.380
 so he does that so he usually 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.380
 in a mica form 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.700
 I apply it on my nose and in this area 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.829
 from here because that 's where I have pores 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.269
 dilated but if you have 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.819
 also for example the forehead such is 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.610
 you can apply good since I have it applied 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.709
 so even though he's a student 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.799
 It has mechanical effect also has 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.390
 chemical effect then I in general 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.769
 with all the different cells passes 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.530
 they always have some component 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.750
 also exposes clinically 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.180
 so when I apply it, I leave it 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 time in 5 minutes or so so that 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.440
 also do chemical foliation so 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.840
 Now I 'm coming back, well, I 'm here 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.760
 After waiting for a little while, I 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.430
 the removed is removed with warm water 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.980
 So then, now we have the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 scavenged skin to apply the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.230
 second step that in this case is the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.370
 flesh - colored egg brown color and this 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.270
 product is a purifying mask 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.060
 What it does is 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.980
 now that we have the exposed skin that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.200
 we have removed the dead cells the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.720
 more superficial skin of the nose 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.030
 in this case we can use the mask 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.980
 to penetrate more deeply and be 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.750
 more attractive then it 's a mask 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.930
 purifying that goes into the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.600
 pores and cleans them and also has a 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.640
 substance that makes you are 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.070
 unleashed as is my case they light 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.380
 a little bit becomes less visible 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.450
 then the same thing from before comes the same and 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.850
 the same thing also has the plant 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.900
 come on these then it breaks it cracks like 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.280
 egg and you can take out a twig 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.280
 the same will be 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:44.300
 This product is very dense 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:49.750
 it's an egg color mask what 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.750
 we apply in this case the nose 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.860
 it is always convenient to apply these 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.750
 masks after henares lecture 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.300
 because that way the product will penetrate 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.400
 better on the skin and it will be more effective 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.110
 because it's going to get to more parties 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.000
 deep of the skin and it does not go is not going to 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.620
 lose lose product with cells 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.360
 dead that is what we have in the 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.940
 outermost part of the skin and the same 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.790
 that before now our very best 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.190
 I'll wait about 20 minutes for 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.800
 the effect mask in this case I hope 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.260
 20 minutes and the Basque week is already going to 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.360
 dry and we will also remove it as the 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.210
 scrub with warm water because of 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.310
 returned after 20 minutes of 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.280
 wait for the mask and the pulled 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.140
 also with warm water and as you can see 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.900
 result is very good because I have 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.610
 all this area very soft I think that it 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.190
 will appreciate well you see that the forums 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:45.370
 they are very diminished 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.860
 let's go with the last product of the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.419
 three that is the new golden 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.389
 this product what is is a kind 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.959
 of balsam that applies the last and what 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:01.479
 what it does is leave the area very soft this 

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:02.979
 balm is applied just before a 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.129
 moisturizer and what it does is that 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.459
 preserve that area of 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.309
 clean and so you can apply the 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.439
 treating cream over and keep the 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.989
 effect that the mask has received and 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.259
 the front before as this is the 

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:22.080
 product that is of the three although the 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.269
 exfoliating and 11de is fine but 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.880
 this I love first also smells 

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:29.350
 cool 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.350
 and see if you see it well 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.610
 today it looks good it is exactly a 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.949
 balsam but it is very very very dense 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.430
 It is also like the other and with a 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.430
 small amount 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.430
 and well, this is the effect 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.650
 final is super soft with the balm 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.770
 last one that we have applied and as you see 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.320
 the pores are clean and no longer 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.910
 black dots and also what I say that 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.980
 decreases the size of the pores 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.860
 dilated that is in a bigger problem 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.080
 that I have this routine could be done 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.140
 every fifteen days I do it every fifteen 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.840
 days or at least he tried and you see 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.420
 that you take little time and that the 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.090
 result is hard enough not here is where 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.290
 comes the little plant 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:25.990
 what is your use and the whole container 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:28.960
 as a flower pot because you have not liked anything 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.400
 the video if you have interested please where 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.460
 I like to subscribe to my channel that I 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.710
 It makes a lot of hope I hope that you 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.639
 it has been interesting and see you 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.639
