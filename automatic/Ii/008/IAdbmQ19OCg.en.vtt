an<00:01:08.700> attack<00:01:08.939> helicopter<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.630> work<00:01:09.900> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
an attack helicopter which work just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
an attack helicopter which work just
fine<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.790> keep<00:01:11.909> watching<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
fine so if you keep watching here I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
fine so if you keep watching here I
don't<00:01:12.720> actually<00:01:13.020> die<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.650> my

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
don't actually die some like my

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
don't actually die some like my
killstreaks<00:01:14.790> reset<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.350> there's<00:01:16.530> no<00:01:16.619> issues

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
killstreaks reset and there's no issues

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
killstreaks reset and there's no issues
with<00:01:17.130> using<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> ones<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.299> once<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.720> reset

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
with using the ones that once they reset

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.920 
with using the ones that once they reset
so<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:20.189> don't<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.640> happened<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so I I just don't know what happened it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
so I I just don't know what happened it
seems<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.009> potential<00:01:23.430> bug<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
seems to me like a potential bug because

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.539 
seems to me like a potential bug because
I<00:01:23.909> can't<00:01:24.210> think<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.799> for<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I can't think of a way for this not to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
I can't think of a way for this not to
work<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.030> know<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> mean<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:28.040> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
work you know what I mean like just that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.819 
work you know what I mean like just that
doesn't<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> lot<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> sense<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> me<00:01:30.090> but

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
doesn't make a lot of sense to me but

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.870 
doesn't make a lot of sense to me but
like<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.920> said<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.189> an<00:01:32.340> idiot<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.700> how

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
like I said I'm not an idiot I know how

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
like I said I'm not an idiot I know how
to<00:01:32.970> use<00:01:33.030> kill<00:01:33.509> streaks<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.140> whatnot<00:01:34.470> unless

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to use kill streaks and whatnot unless

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
to use kill streaks and whatnot unless
there<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.369> something<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.090> miss<00:01:36.299> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there is something little i miss but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.100 
there is something little i miss but
what<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> odds<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.590> always<00:01:37.950> having

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
what are the odds of always having

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
what are the odds of always having
something<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> air<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> watch<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
something in the air and if you watch I

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
maybe this could be a bug and just kind

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.770

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
of SAT here and kept trying to get it to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.809 
of SAT here and kept trying to get it to

helicopter and it works fine too so
unless<00:03:17.239> there<00:03:17.569> was<00:03:17.659> some<00:03:18.759> rare<00:03:19.759> occurrence

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
unless there was some rare occurrence

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.899 
unless there was some rare occurrence
where<00:03:20.509> maybe<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.019> just<00:03:21.259> didn't<00:03:21.620> notice<00:03:21.909> someone

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
where maybe I just didn't notice someone

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.399 
where maybe I just didn't notice someone
else's<00:03:23.269> killstreaks<00:03:23.689> going<00:03:23.959> off<00:03:24.079> but<00:03:24.229> that

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
else's killstreaks going off but that

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.050 
else's killstreaks going off but that
doesn't<00:03:24.979> make<00:03:25.040> sense<00:03:25.099> because<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.609> always<00:03:25.849> paid

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
doesn't make sense because I always paid

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.890 
doesn't make sense because I always paid
into<00:03:26.359> that<00:03:26.569> but<00:03:26.979> I<00:03:28.509> honestly<00:03:29.509> think<00:03:29.689> it's<00:03:29.780> a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
into that but I honestly think it's a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.869 
into that but I honestly think it's a
bug<00:03:30.079> I'm<00:03:30.259> like<00:03:30.379> 99%<00:03:31.069> sure<00:03:31.099> i<00:03:31.220> bugged<00:03:31.639> it<00:03:31.759> out

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
actually I don't even think there's

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.449 
actually I don't even think there's
anything<00:03:50.060> out<00:03:50.769> yeah<00:03:51.769> it's<00:03:51.919> not<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.280> go<00:03:52.430> up

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
anything out yeah it's not so I go up

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.640 
anything out yeah it's not so I go up
the<00:03:52.609> stairs<00:03:52.879> I'll<00:03:53.299> give<00:03:53.509> another<00:03:53.540> kill<00:03:54.439> here

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
there was nothing in the air for the

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.610 
there was nothing in the air for the
last<00:04:11.120> like<00:04:11.329> four<00:04:11.599> or<00:04:11.750> five<00:04:11.780> kills<00:04:12.199> of<00:04:12.469> that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
last like four or five kills of that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.189 
last like four or five kills of that
match<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.099> I'm<00:04:13.609> confused<00:04:13.909> I<00:04:14.389> think<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.959> bug

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
match so I'm confused I think it's a bug

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.949 
match so I'm confused I think it's a bug
if<00:04:16.190> anyone<00:04:16.549> can<00:04:16.579> fill<00:04:16.849> me<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.030> otherwise<00:04:17.449> or

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
if anyone can fill me in otherwise or

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.769 
if anyone can fill me in otherwise or
maybe<00:04:18.469> I'm<00:04:18.709> just<00:04:18.940> out<00:04:19.940> of<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.150> loop<00:04:20.329> and<00:04:20.570> it's

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:20.779 
maybe I'm just out of the loop and it's

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.090 
maybe I'm just out of the loop and it's
been<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:20.959> bug<00:04:21.139> for<00:04:21.529> quite<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.919> while<00:04:22.099> which
