at least people that work at Samsung use

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.110 
at least people that work at Samsung use
social<00:00:31.349> networking<00:00:31.920> sites<00:00:32.309> such<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.550> YouTube

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
social networking sites such as YouTube

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.479 
social networking sites such as YouTube
as<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> way<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> gathering<00:00:33.870> feedback<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.130> let's

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
as a way of gathering feedback so let's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
as a way of gathering feedback so let's
add<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:35.820> information<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> web<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
add some information to the web and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
add some information to the web and
discuss<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.040> features<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
discuss what features we would like to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.960 
discuss what features we would like to
see<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> Galaxy<00:00:40.110> Note<00:00:40.140> 4

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.060 

so<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.090> first<00:00:49.330> item<00:00:49.750> is<00:00:49.930> display<00:00:50.500> size<00:00:50.770> I

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
so the first item is display size I

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.830 
so the first item is display size I
personally<00:00:51.670> think<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.240> size<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
personally think that the size of the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.440 
personally think that the size of the
note<00:00:53.020> 3<00:00:53.380> is<00:00:53.410> perfect<00:00:54.100> if<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.940> was<00:00:55.060> any<00:00:55.240> bigger

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
note 3 is perfect if it was any bigger

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.360 
note 3 is perfect if it was any bigger
maybe<00:00:55.780> i<00:00:55.930> would<00:00:56.110> start<00:00:56.410> getting<00:00:56.740> a<00:00:56.800> bit<00:00:57.070> hard

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
maybe i would start getting a bit hard

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.340 
maybe i would start getting a bit hard
to<00:00:57.430> carry<00:00:57.760> in<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:57.970> pocket<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.020> i<00:00:59.050> would<00:00:59.320> love

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
to carry in the pocket so i would love

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.290 
to carry in the pocket so i would love
to<00:00:59.620> see<00:00:59.800> samsung<00:01:00.250> keep<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.550> device<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.060> same

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
to see samsung keep the device the same

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.570 
to see samsung keep the device the same
size<00:01:01.540> but<00:01:01.810> somehow<00:01:02.140> increase<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.130> display

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
size but somehow increase the display

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.880 
size but somehow increase the display
size<00:01:03.850> by<00:01:04.120> reducing<00:01:04.630> the<00:01:04.690> borders<00:01:05.170> with<00:01:05.740> that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
size by reducing the borders with that

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.410 
size by reducing the borders with that
said<00:01:06.220> if<00:01:06.370> they<00:01:06.490> happen<00:01:06.910> to<00:01:06.940> release<00:01:07.390> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
said if they happen to release a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.570 
said if they happen to release a
slightly<00:01:07.960> larger<00:01:08.350> device<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.130> wouldn't<00:01:09.520> be

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
slightly larger device I wouldn't be

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.580 
slightly larger device I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:10.150> if<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:10.570> initially<00:01:10.990> think<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
surprised if I initially think the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.800 
surprised if I initially think the
device<00:01:11.920> is<00:01:12.130> too<00:01:12.370> big<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.760> then<00:01:13.180> totally<00:01:13.630> get

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
device is too big and then totally get

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.450 
device is too big and then totally get
used<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.140> carrying<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.560> larger<00:01:14.920> device<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.400> a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
used to carrying a larger device in a

used to carrying a larger device in a
matter<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.940> few<00:01:16.150> hours<00:01:16.240> which<00:01:16.960> tends<00:01:17.260> to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
matter of a few hours which tends to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.190 
matter of a few hours which tends to
happen<00:01:17.680> all<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.860> time<00:01:18.810> second<00:01:19.810> what<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.020> would

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200

happen all the time second what I would
like<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.410> see<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:20.950> better<00:01:21.340> battery<00:01:21.759> life<00:01:21.850> not

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
like to see is better battery life not

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.960 
like to see is better battery life not
100<00:01:23.350> million<00:01:23.740> power<00:01:23.920> increases<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:24.790> I'm

this<00:02:30.069> feature<00:02:30.280> was<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.580> bit<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.090> stretch<00:02:31.390> but

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
this feature was a bit of a stretch but

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.960 
this feature was a bit of a stretch but
it<00:02:31.810> turns<00:02:32.050> out<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.290> Android<00:02:33.010> L<00:02:33.220> will<00:02:33.520> support

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
it turns out that Android L will support

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.360 
it turns out that Android L will support
this<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.620> considering<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.920> note<00:02:36.099> 4

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
this and considering that the note 4

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.190 
this and considering that the note 4
will<00:02:36.640> almost<00:02:36.910> certainly<00:02:37.360> come<00:02:37.959> with<00:02:38.080> the

will almost certainly come with the
latest<00:02:38.410> OS<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:39.550> may<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.819> entirely<00:02:40.300> possible

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
latest OS this may be entirely possible

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.970 
latest OS this may be entirely possible
and<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.550> me<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:42.940> must-have<00:02:43.569> feature

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
and this for me is a must-have feature

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.800 
and this for me is a must-have feature
there<00:02:44.980> are<00:02:45.130> many<00:02:45.340> advantages<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:46.330> shooting<00:02:46.690> in

there are many advantages to shooting in

there are many advantages to shooting in

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.000

similar<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.629> capturing<00:02:55.989> raw<00:02:56.230> files<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:56.829> this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
similar to capturing raw files but this

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.670 
similar to capturing raw files but this
time<00:02:57.189> would

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680

and<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.819> think<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.120> 4k<00:02:59.510> video<00:02:59.989> is

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
and I really think that 4k video is

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.069 
and I really think that 4k video is
superb<00:03:00.799> especially<00:03:01.430> on<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.609> galaxy<00:03:02.120> s5<00:03:02.569> that

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
superb especially on the galaxy s5 that

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.380 
superb especially on the galaxy s5 that
lets<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.530> shoot<00:03:03.739> HDR<00:03:04.310> video<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.909> I<00:03:05.030> think<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
lets you shoot HDR video and I think the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.670 
lets you shoot HDR video and I think the
quality<00:03:05.870> would<00:03:06.049> be<00:03:06.200> good<00:03:06.379> enough<00:03:06.620> for

quality would be good enough for

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.949 
quality would be good enough for
