360 never really got off the ground it
makes<00:00:43.800> sense<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
makes sense that they would want to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970

create a new better one themselves also
this<00:00:47.100> most<00:00:47.340> certainly<00:00:47.700> puts<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> rest<00:00:48.090> rumors

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this most certainly puts to rest rumors

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.439 
this most certainly puts to rest rumors
of<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.840> potential<00:00:49.289> bebo<00:00:49.620> bias<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.390> may<00:00:51.390> be

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
of a potential bebo bias that may be

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
of a potential bebo bias that may be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
interface that would serve as the
