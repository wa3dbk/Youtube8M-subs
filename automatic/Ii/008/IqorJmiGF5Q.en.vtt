00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.050
 well I'll show you how to do this 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.450
 a rose with a simple napkin this 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.610
 the only ingredient that we are going to 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 use here or the only thing that we're going 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.660
 to use make a napkin 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
 Well the first step to do it is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.119
 pink with a napkin this we are going to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.490
 extend our napkin and the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.110
 open 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.500
 very carefully so that it does not break 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.560
 because it is a very delicate dessert 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.400
 well we already have well extended we are going to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.840
 take a shore 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.990
 any out of a rectangle 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.690
 framed by one 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.710
 Y 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.810
 we are going 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.080
 make a small fold 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.340
 more or less about 1 centimeter left 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.730
 right and right this 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.790
 we press so that it does not move and that 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.420
 fold it we will re-double 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.739
 to make a slightly thicker edge 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 very carefully all this 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.850
 we press it so that it stays and it does not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850
 move 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:19.130
 good since it stayed like this 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.460
 and we're going to take a corner and we're going to 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.090
 make a small fold 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 this that we have a triangle of this 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.490
 way and we're going to make another small 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.280
 fold 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.870
 in the middle of the triangle more or less what 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.790
 we squeeze well so you stay 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.990
 and good in this way because of our 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.509
 first step 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.420
 step number 2 to make our rose 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.250
 is going to be our first step that we take 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.370
 aside from the corner where we bend 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.260
 we turn it in this way 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.020
 and what we are going to do we are going to roll 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.450
 the paper very carefully as it is 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.800
 a very fragile paper we'll first go 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.930
 to tighten a little 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.810
 and as we get closer to the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.229
 shore 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.350
 let's make it a little weaker 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:18.190
 so that this air remains between the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.440
 air and space between 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.320
 finish 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.200
 between the napkin and we have more 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.480
 pretty our rose 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.140
 we can guide ourselves so that they live right 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.140
 with this line 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.070
 and remember that in the end they have to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 be a little more sponge says in 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.950
 our 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.550
 and napkin will be good us 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 this way 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.180
 we are guided with the part of the doubles that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.600
 we did finishing the fold of the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.090
 corner let's squeeze a bit of this 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.070
 way and we're going to start turning towards 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.650
 a side like that in whatever they want 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.950
 we are going to do it by squeezing 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.360
 trying to make the stem of the rose 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.090
 we will push very hard to avoid 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.920
 be done 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.319
 but also very carefully as it is 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.230
 a very fragile paper 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.110
 good since we were left this part of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.390
 this size more or less like about 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.630
 two or three centimeters take us in the 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.450
 corner and we will lift it with much 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.450
 care not we go to break 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.160
 and we're going to try to flip it 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.150
 upwards 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.150
 that in this way 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.709
 since we stayed that way we're going to 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.980
 take the part of the stem and we're going to 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.640
 follow this by turning it 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.590
 pressing very hard to come if 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.819
 do not fall apart but at the same time 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.819
 be careful that it will not break 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.760
 well we make this a little doubles 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.720
 in our sheet a little out of 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.720
 this way 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.960
 and this yes we have our good rose 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.410
 this is the part of the petals and it is the 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.580
 part of the stem and the good leaf I hope 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.530
 have you liked this one rose this very 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.750
 pretty good you can open a little the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.310
 petals but I like more of this 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.310
 way is like a button
