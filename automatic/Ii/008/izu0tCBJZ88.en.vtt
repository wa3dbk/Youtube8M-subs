00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
colleagues at the beginning were a bit

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
concerned about how you would

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
concerned about how you would
incorporate<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> whole<00:01:02.039> school<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.969> how
