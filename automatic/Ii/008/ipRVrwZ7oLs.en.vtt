now<00:01:49.480> in<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.690> back<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.960> my<00:01:50.050> chair

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
now in the back of my chair

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.720 
now in the back of my chair
I<00:01:50.500> think<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:50.980> dictionary<00:01:51.370> just<00:01:51.550> kind<00:01:51.700> of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
I think the dictionary just kind of

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.250 
I think the dictionary just kind of
gives<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.030> an<00:01:52.150> extra<00:01:52.390> resource<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> little

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
gives it an extra resource it's a little

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.200 
gives it an extra resource it's a little
bit<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.470> extra<00:01:53.890> confidence<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:55.090> saying

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
bit of extra confidence of just saying

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.460 
bit of extra confidence of just saying
you<00:01:55.300> know<00:01:55.390> what<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:55.870> look<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.110> word<00:01:56.290> up

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
you know what you can look the word up

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.810 
you know what you can look the word up
you<00:01:56.830> know<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:57.100> able<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.370> use<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.730> the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
you know be able to use it in the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.860 
you know be able to use it in the
sentence<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.450> don't<00:01:58.540> know<00:01:58.690> what<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
sentence you don't know what the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.690 
sentence you don't know what the
definition<00:01:59.020> ailes<00:01:59.620> and<00:01:59.740> so<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.190> think

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
definition ailes and so I think

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.280 
definition ailes and so I think
dictionaries<00:02:01.240> are<00:02:01.330> very<00:02:01.510> important<00:02:01.960> someone

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290
