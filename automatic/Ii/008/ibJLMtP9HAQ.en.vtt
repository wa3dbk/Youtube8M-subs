00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.699
 hello, I am víctor javier aquino bermúdez 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.160
 in football they know me as a vítolo and 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.200
 this is the story of the whole story 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.270
 of my stature that is very simple I 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.009
 I think the theme of tattoos that 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.320
 it has to be something that you like 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.630
 you're going to get a tattoo you have to have 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.800
 a meaning then 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.550
 in my left arm a little 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.720
 a little is religious themes that always 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 they have accompanied me has helped me 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.910
 very much 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.699
 especially when when one plays 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.899
 outside because I played many years out 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.170
 Well, it's good, it motivates you a little 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.440
 all religious themes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.200
 maybe good the right arm is still a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.660
 little more personal 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.510
 and my mother 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.720
 my father 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.660
 attached to music because my father 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.050
 plays quite well and good is associated with 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.010
 him with a little bit higher 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.010
 and my sister 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.560
 well the name of my nephew attached to 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.409
 it really and good its dates a 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.210
 Canarian symbol and all of the house 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.030
 football 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.870
 how beautiful a 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 to my philosophy of life 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.810
 are my mother's hands exactly 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.520
 what will it be that he watches over us a little 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.180
 to the people who have played so many 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.340
 years out this has says number 6 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.509
 with which throughout my career has 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.880
 played and good this one of the most emotional 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.700
 for me because it is the tenerife 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.619
 playing already in gray in pau and in 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 panathinaikos for several years already 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.909
 I had it with me everywhere 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.340
 because well I think that the Tenerife 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.130
 I owe a lot given that it gives me the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.420
 possibility of the best to my family 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.890
 even though 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.940
 he was in second b 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.370
 or disappear this is always 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.010
 with me because before this player 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.950
 from tenerife I was fond of 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.460
 tenerife and right that I think I keep 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:35.630
 doing 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:37.040
 in the category many more years and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.480
 then in the first team other 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 how many then 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.819
 I am first amateur what 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.290
 continue a little 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.900
 the chest that we continue a little 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.250
 relatives on behalf of my parents 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.550
 family phrases 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.400
 and well my statues that revolve around 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.030
 to the family that they are when they are out 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.430
 the source of motivation and makes you be 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.410
 a little linked to them, especially 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.480
 moment of slump moment that I kicked out of 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.760
 less and you realize why do the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.390
 things I always like very much the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.000
 philosophy the tattoo because I think you 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.800
 They wear a tattoo is for life and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.350
 in me I like to carry these things to 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.340
 all my life so I can talk about 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.340
 it and remember
