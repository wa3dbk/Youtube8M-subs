00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
to consistency all our racing fuels I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
to consistency all our racing fuels I
had<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.670> those<00:00:59.760> years<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.420> you'll<00:01:00.540> be<00:01:00.570> able

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
had all those years now you'll be able

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.299 
had all those years now you'll be able
to<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.200> pump<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.100> there's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to get it right at the pump so there's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.399 
to get it right at the pump so there's
no<00:01:02.460> issues<00:01:02.880> even<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.329> places<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.720> California

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
no issues even in places like California

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
no issues even in places like California
where<00:01:04.470> emissions<00:01:04.829> are<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.280> important<00:01:05.819> carb

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
where emissions are so important carb

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
where emissions are so important carb
approved<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> key<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:07.950> for

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
approved that's the key thing for

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
approved that's the key thing for
California<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.789> are<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> carb<00:01:09.240> approved<00:01:09.539> fuel

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
California we are a carb approved fuel

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510

up soon when we talk more about that in
the<00:01:39.389> future<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.859> can<00:01:40.979> also<00:01:41.130> blend<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the future I see you can also blend this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.059 
the future I see you can also blend this
fuel<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.090> others<00:01:42.389> exactly<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.770> states

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
fuel with others exactly some states

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.370 
fuel with others exactly some states
have<00:01:44.249> a<00:01:44.279> 91<00:01:44.849> octane<00:01:45.029> maximum<00:01:45.840> fuel<00:01:45.990> range<00:01:46.200> such

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
have a 91 octane maximum fuel range such

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.809 
have a 91 octane maximum fuel range such
as<00:01:46.499> California<00:01:47.009> Iowa<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.399> several<00:01:47.670> other

as California Iowa and several other

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.129 
as California Iowa and several other
states<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:48.479> other<00:01:48.630> states<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:48.990> Illinois

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
states from other states like Illinois

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.339 
states from other states like Illinois
you<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.409> 93<00:01:49.950> Wisconsin<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.819> 92<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
you have 93 Wisconsin is 92 so it's a

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:53.719 
you have 93 Wisconsin is 92 so it's a
little<00:01:52.529> inconsistent<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.279> someone<00:01:53.520> who<00:01:53.609> has

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
little inconsistent for someone who has

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.910 
little inconsistent for someone who has
at<00:01:53.880> performance<00:01:54.299> vehicles<00:01:54.719> where<00:01:55.200> they<00:01:55.709> want

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
at performance vehicles where they want

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.379 
at performance vehicles where they want

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:57.389 
to get that performance rating but if

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:58.669 
to get that performance rating but if
you<00:01:57.479> check<00:01:57.749> your<00:01:57.779> owner's<00:01:58.229> manual<00:01:58.259> there's

you check your owner's manual there's
over<00:01:58.919> 280<00:01:59.579> cars<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.179> now<00:02:00.209> that<00:02:00.840> say<00:02:01.049> you

must run a performance fuel to get

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:03.769 
must run a performance fuel to get
optimum<00:02:02.789> performance<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.299> your<00:02:03.419> car<00:02:03.569> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
bought that car for performance you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.620 
bought that car for performance you
didn't<00:02:05.549> buy<00:02:05.639> it<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.819> drive<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.209> with<00:02:06.329> half<00:02:06.479> the

didn't buy it to drive it with half the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.760 
didn't buy it to drive it with half the
performance<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:07.349> all<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> fuel

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
performance because that's all the fuel

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.520 
performance because that's all the fuel
you<00:02:07.859> can<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.819> take<00:02:09.000> BP<00:02:09.209> 100<00:02:09.959> blend

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you can get so you can take BP 100 blend

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.649 
you can get so you can take BP 100 blend
it<00:02:10.799> with<00:02:11.189> your<00:02:11.250> current<00:02:11.760> fuel<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.299> get<00:02:12.540> the

it with your current fuel and get the

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.280 
it with your current fuel and get the
desired<00:02:12.959> octane<00:02:13.319> rating<00:02:13.530> you're<00:02:13.620> looking<00:02:13.890> for
