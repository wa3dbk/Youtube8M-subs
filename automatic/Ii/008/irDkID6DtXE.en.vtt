00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:10.730
 good guys welcome more to the channel 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 Well let up something as you know the 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.700
 been raising other crap but 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.500
 why because they were up and more than 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.810
 nothing I want to take advantage of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 and now with all the heat and surely 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 come into my room doing the videos 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.309
 of art 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.260
 you start with twitter face with boots 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.820
 potions and the yellow taste because with 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.040
 boots because it has very little mobility is 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.300
 a character that needs mobility and 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.030
 even sometimes you play with 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.500
 the flash and the ghostly I have 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.309
 tried and I do not mind playing it with 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.309
 ghostly or with 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 with this or with inditex is not the most 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 normal is that you have some gloves with 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 the last more continuous lengths and others 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.409
 but good with this order what 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.409
 first I like to do 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.079
 they will come out 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.000
 the lic after years thinking the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.200
 name because it looks or explained in 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.510
 how much would you give the button 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.630
 of the w vale select already then 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.610
 acceleration the letter 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.500
 that activates the milk letter if a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.600
 that we add the passive you're going to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.479
 hit a montonazo vale 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.400
 very much very much to a carry you can 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.030
 Remove three fourth lives three quarters 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.670
 of life 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.020
 about three quarters of life is worth what 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.540
 next another thing that is used a lot the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.570
 last is to paste say a 20 up 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.340
 the fat one pulls and the last one and in the middle of 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.170
 rival team while it reaches your 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.960
 team the rival team spends everything in 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 you and you use the sonia in the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.070
 moment in which he appears with 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.869
 it happens last have spent all 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.700
 they have not hurt they have nothing and 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.420
 your team is on top of them 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.920
 cool 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.660
 very good and now we go with the boots 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 because the boot 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.940
 because yes because it takes a little bit 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 of mobility is worth 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.120
 we go with radon to have more damage 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.580
 to understand more anmape more harm we 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.810
 missing that the bronze in 99 and starts to 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.800
 insult because I did not say that the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 ballet up recorder 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.450
 the empty cane because for the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.680
 passive ok and finally I like it 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.940
 last object normally in as 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.820
 that the opposing team carries some 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.320
 other things here I have put a 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.700
 leandro and valencia that there are other 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.970
 things for our thing I'm comfortable 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.500
 our 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.310
 let's try this next rune what's 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.470
 it is always worth ap 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.310
 to find then to contrapiÃ© and if not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.250
 you can find 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.120
 the red ones are hybrid penetration 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.840
 yellow are in this case regeneration 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.510
 of mana that is not much needed either 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.930
 Y 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.959
 yes in the apple blue 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.000
 we have forgiveness already but of resistance 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.670
 magic the age we take it in the fifth 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.170
 that we like I have another video with all 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.320
 the masters and rolls if you want 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.440
 look at it from the mastery of the runes that 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.940
 you want mastery 2109 taking advantage 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.560
 obviously the ape reduction 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.930
 cooling and here you see we have the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.830
 good here bits is worth me I'm 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.720
 recording only audio the same but it puts 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.220
 in utility the second icon of the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.910
 botita three points of three points because 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.790
 because we need mobility 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.830
 very good advice that you can use the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.740
 last so much to flee as to top 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.620
 like for whatever it does not matter I think 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.629
 which comes in handy to use you know 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.640
 and try to form all power also by 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.879
 the passive also you can stay as a 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.760
 kart or escape in the middle because 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.129
 normally you go halfway and when 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.599
 you go that won something there is a last one that 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.599
 site and that's it 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.460
 tricks to permeate when you get more 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:34.440
 or less one hundred and a little bit 150 I think 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.810
 that even the 125 vouchers out there already 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.630
 vice about it 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.270
 you will say the red letter to the second minimum 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.220
 of melee and then you throw a straight hill 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.070
 that gives you all the domain 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.260
 usually 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.880
 if you do it right, they formed the line 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.960
 whole if you have a mini a fat one 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.960
 fact that comes mounted on the car 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.800
 you have to kill him apart it's worth it because if 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.480
 not if he has a lot of life a lot of armor 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.710
 because but a lot of gender and so on 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.269
 what 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.489
 or I load it for 5 

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:07.689
 the blue letter is the one that hurts the most 

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:10.539
 OK 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:14.519
 you know the yellow shines now the 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.519
 Red does damage in area and the lower 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.830
 the blue retrieves mana recover point 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.730
 of mana is worth it because if I'm not wrong 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 50 is what it is worth to use the letter and 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.120
 recover 60 or recover 10 weeks 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.490
 point 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.300
 not much of good 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.680
 a little his 30 beautiful and not 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.240
 and well, I think that in principle 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.370
 that's all you already know what you want 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.440
 down here comments glasses 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.690
 swear words that I did not say that there is a 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.000
 Cuba and new in the income does not work for 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.580
 nothing or say that you do not like the name 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.110
 I do not care 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.090
 that you can put what you create below 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.310
 you know that he is free to ask what the 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.240
 guide you want others please have 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.159
 mercy that we are in summer 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.169
 here I was moving, it's worth here in Sevilla 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:59.080
 40 degrees and this is impossible are videos and 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.620
