 as an escort to attend the event 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.550
 from that of being the starting point 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.420
 another being viable 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.520
 he paid for both sides or is one for the pilot to participate with teaching 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.710

 to appear is profit is the citizens of the prize then we believe that the 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.350
 brand of neuron to arrive in a form 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960

 a bonus on each step and that bonus lying Ana in the final part on the drums 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.030
 end of the south and now afternoon 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 perfect and this is extremely important criterion that study 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 since 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.140
 insert the google wave let's say so have opportunity in the background as 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 get modern results is this an hour for sure to apavt and pain 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.400
 from that stunned booklet of private law rape that came to the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 nba with three rounds three weeks into qualifying 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.999
 always had done 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.230
 ah is such a situation 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.470
 trying to take out or regiment but when what you have in hand 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.040
 so he tried to lend a hand the logic in the race is that this service he can 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.770
 a possible break 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.079
 in the meantime alignment and after exchanging the payment 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.609
 only this is the moment that gave the bandit and it happens anything 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.069
 from there it's a normal race explains the document 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.519
 out of the race 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.079
 the mind was highlighted in this event 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:35.279
 is the presentation of the day highly qualified professionals and in all 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.139
 championship sectors 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.649
 in the mechanic shop we got better then for two of the best mechanics 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:47.129
 who are developing a work of equalization of 35 kartist 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.940
 totally new and developed by love especially for this event 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.029
 the staff because it is professional and minute adhesive from the part of 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.509
 decoration of vehicles that have been inter- 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.749
 the part that remained technical organization I would like 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.279
 sure we have to think of all the details of a race is not 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.209
 it's just the go-cart and it's not just the physical breakdown and everything that involves a 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:36.870
 running 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.520
 thaçi around the program include the best of the state all the 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.050
 The commissioners went through our orientation and the park ie we gave to the senate 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.099
 jorge letria multi-champion one in brazilian before everything that ever walked 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.250
 because they are paulo 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.130
 he won then so it's action and spelling of the much more expensive guy 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.480
 experienced help the athlete got new by looking now at the race that is 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.640
 truly 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.260
 It is so obvious and 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 is to curb attitudes before because we had that so far 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.589
 succeeding to comply with 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.779
 with little or very little information on the personal channel that led to the 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.079
 stoppage has ended 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.510
 we are aware that he closed with an attitude ended up being suspended action 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.969
 It was a disaster 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.509
 mallu 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.830
 makes a positive balance of the event's balance of the great event that is 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.810
 occurring here in the white velopark good extremely positive balance up to 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:34.850
 more than 300 people arrested for what they signed up for 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.620

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 already started and have shown interest 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.680
 so this is it, you? 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.480
 is only 209 pilot in an event since the level of this spectacular day is 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.449
 a thing like that 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.150
 is the government is in the south of the country is good commented 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.330
 are eight Brazilian states represented then that was mottaki 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.240
 to exist an open field for the fitch and moody amateur where something good 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.979
 organized and can evolve
