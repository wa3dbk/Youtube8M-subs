00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
soundboard but only we're gonna do it

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.550 
soundboard but only we're gonna do it
with<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> different<00:04:03.150> rhythm<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:04.109> cackle

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
sounds something like this

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.120 
sounds something like this
I<00:04:05.910> just<00:04:06.600> went<00:04:06.780> ahead<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.079> flying<00:04:07.500> down<00:04:07.739> or<00:04:08.010> up

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
I just went ahead and flying down or up

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.520 
I just went ahead and flying down or up
from<00:04:08.640> from<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> tree<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:13.049> know<00:04:13.140> what<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.350> like

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
from from the tree you know what I like

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.590 
from from the tree you know what I like
to<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.829> is<00:04:13.980> I'll<00:04:14.130> actually<00:04:14.160> take<00:04:14.730> my<00:04:14.970> elbow<00:04:15.450> and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
to do is I'll actually take my elbow and

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.750 
to do is I'll actually take my elbow and
pin<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.470> against<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.010> side<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.430> my<00:04:17.519> body

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
pin it in against the side of my body

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.569 
pin it in against the side of my body
and<00:04:18.150> then<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.079> it's<00:04:19.229> just<00:04:19.530> it's<00:04:20.100> only<00:04:20.310> my

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
and then so it's just it's only my

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.210 
and then so it's just it's only my
forearm<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.269> my<00:04:21.329> wrist<00:04:21.690> working<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.979> that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
forearm and my wrist working and that

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.490 
forearm and my wrist working and that
stabilizes<00:04:24.060> my<00:04:24.240> elbow<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.990> that

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
stabilizes my elbow and I just and that

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.370 
stabilizes my elbow and I just and that
wrist<00:04:28.800> action<00:04:29.070> just

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
wrist action just

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.080 
wrist action just
and<00:04:32.380> that's<00:04:32.560> that's<00:04:32.980> what<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.250> cackle<00:04:33.700> takes<00:04:33.940> a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
and that's that's what a cackle takes a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.820 
and that's that's what a cackle takes a
little<00:04:34.210> more<00:04:34.360> practice<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.170> eventually<00:04:35.470> you

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
little more practice but eventually you

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.040 
little more practice but eventually you
can<00:04:36.010> get<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.460> make<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.060> sound<00:04:37.330> pretty<00:04:37.600> nice

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
can get it and make it sound pretty nice

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.130 
can get it and make it sound pretty nice
all<00:04:38.230> right<00:04:38.440> purring<00:04:38.950> purring<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:40.000> uh<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.540> nice

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
all right purring purring is uh a nice

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.320 
all right purring purring is uh a nice
call<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.620> use<00:04:41.800> when<00:04:42.070> he<00:04:42.130> got<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.430> gobbler<00:04:42.880> fairly

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
call to use when he got a gobbler fairly

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
don't want to apply very much pressure

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.970 
don't want to apply very much pressure
on<00:05:11.920> it<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.420> just<00:05:13.420> grasp<00:05:14.170> it<00:05:14.470> just<00:05:14.680> enough

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980

it across the sand board and make some

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.780 
it across the sand board and make some
nice<00:05:25.510> perfect<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.950> a<00:05:30.040> lot<00:05:30.220> of<00:05:30.250> hands<00:05:30.640> over

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
nice perfect and a lot of hands over

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.700 
nice perfect and a lot of hands over
here<00:05:30.970> I'm<00:05:31.060> gonna<00:05:31.210> turn<00:05:31.540> them<00:05:31.840> they'll<00:05:32.500> do<00:05:32.680> a

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
here I'm gonna turn them they'll do a

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.100 
here I'm gonna turn them they'll do a
purr<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.310> cluck<00:05:33.610> right<00:05:33.910> after<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:34.690> it's

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
purr and a cluck right after it so it's

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:46.710 
purr and a cluck right after it so it's
like<00:05:35.350> this<00:05:45.000> remember<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.150> showed<00:05:46.270> you<00:05:46.540> the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
like this remember I showed you the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.010 
like this remember I showed you the
cluck<00:05:46.960> is<00:05:47.170> just<00:05:47.580> set<00:05:48.580> it<00:05:48.700> on<00:05:48.790> there<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.210> flick

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
cluck is just set it on there and flick

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.560 
cluck is just set it on there and flick
of<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.170> wrist<00:05:53.070> so<00:05:54.070> really<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.030> little<00:05:55.330> bit<00:05:55.480> of

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
of the wrist so really a little bit of

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.570 
of the wrist so really a little bit of
practice<00:05:55.780> you<00:05:56.230> can<00:05:56.380> get<00:05:56.530> good<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:56.890> a<00:05:56.920> box<00:05:57.220> call

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
practice you can get good on a box call

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.640 
practice you can get good on a box call
and<00:05:57.760> they're<00:05:57.940> there<00:05:58.870> they're<00:05:59.110> probably<00:05:59.410> one

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
and they're there they're probably one

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.670 
and they're there they're probably one
of<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.830> best<00:06:00.010> calls<00:06:00.370> are
