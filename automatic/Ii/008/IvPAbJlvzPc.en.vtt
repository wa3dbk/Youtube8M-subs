00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.420 

I<00:01:48.380> happen<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> barbecue<00:01:50.009> one<00:01:50.310> two

mines<00:01:53.909> are<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> little<00:01:54.360> too<00:01:54.719> spicy<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
mines are a little too spicy for me and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.340 
mines are a little too spicy for me and

I think the original is a little too
bland<00:01:58.679> for<00:01:58.950> me<00:01:59.090> this<00:02:00.090> has<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> nice<00:02:00.810> kick<00:02:01.289> just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
bland for me this has a nice kick just
kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> slow<00:02:02.399> burn<00:02:02.789> on<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.390> of
