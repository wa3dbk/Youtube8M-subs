00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.280 
to at least 10 55 so that was a success
possibly<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:42.220> thinner<00:02:43.220> mash<00:02:43.900> made<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.080> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
possibly the thinner mash made it a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.960 
possibly the thinner mash made it a
little<00:02:45.620> bit<00:02:45.860> more<00:02:45.980> efficient<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:46.790> really

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
little bit more efficient I'm not really

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.210 
little bit more efficient I'm not really
sure<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.450> here<00:02:47.660> she<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.260> not<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
sure but here she is it's not going to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.360 
sure but here she is it's not going to
be<00:02:49.340> fermenting<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.239> it's<00:02:50.530> 68<00:02:51.530> degrees<00:02:51.650> we

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
be fermenting it but it's 68 degrees we

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
be fermenting it but it's 68 degrees we
got<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.940> gravity<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.660> actually<00:02:54.110> a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
got to the gravity just actually a

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.780 
got to the gravity just actually a
little<00:02:54.440> bit<00:02:54.620> more<00:02:54.800> than<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> gravity<00:02:55.580> we

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
little bit more than the gravity we

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.949 
little bit more than the gravity we
wanted<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.570> good<00:02:57.560> time<00:02:57.800> was<00:02:58.070> had<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.870> see<00:02:59.870> you

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
wanted and good time was had and see you

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.170 
wanted and good time was had and see you
later
