00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.210 
the old MOT s and a full service history
as<00:05:02.680> well

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
as well

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.310 
as well
so<00:05:03.640> obviously<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:03.940> get<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.120> speedo<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:05.110> rev

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
so obviously you get the speedo the rev

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.730 
so obviously you get the speedo the rev
counter<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:07.320> coolant<00:05:08.320> temperature

gauge<00:05:09.610> as<00:05:10.240> well<00:05:10.510> down<00:05:11.320> here<00:05:11.620> we<00:05:11.680> have<00:05:11.770> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860

got<00:05:22.870> intermittent<00:05:23.410> wipe

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
got intermittent wipe

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.300 
got intermittent wipe
so<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.540> normal<00:05:25.900> indicator<00:05:26.680> stalk<00:05:26.980> on<00:05:27.220> the

so the normal indicator stalk on the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.650 
so the normal indicator stalk on the
other<00:05:27.430> side<00:05:28.110> really<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.320> a<00:05:29.350> rare<00:05:29.680> car<00:05:29.950> this

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660
