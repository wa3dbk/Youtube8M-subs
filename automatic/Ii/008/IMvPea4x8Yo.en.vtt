00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
for body endurance and now you're going
to<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.110> stability<00:02:01.110> exercise<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:03.110> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to do a stability exercise it's a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
to do a stability exercise it's a
reverse<00:02:04.560> plank<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.549> trying<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.930> squeeze

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
reverse plank you're trying to squeeze

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.570 
reverse plank you're trying to squeeze
your<00:02:07.110> butt<00:02:07.320> lift<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.860> hips<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.250> high<00:02:08.280> as

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
your butt lift your hips as high as

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.059 
your butt lift your hips as high as
possible<00:02:09.110> open<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.259> chest<00:02:10.530> cavity<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
possible open your chest cavity and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.390 
possible open your chest cavity and
you're<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.370> getting<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:12.030> good

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you're actually getting some good

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.009 
you're actually getting some good
extension<00:02:12.879> throughout<00:02:13.150> your<00:02:13.299> thoracic

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
extension throughout your thoracic

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.649 
extension throughout your thoracic
cavity<00:02:14.500> your<00:02:15.220> tea<00:02:15.430> spine<00:02:15.849> because<00:02:16.299> especially

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
cavity your tea spine because especially

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.970 
cavity your tea spine because especially
as<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:18.159> cyclist<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.239> always<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.980> spine

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
as a as a cyclist you always have spine

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.190 
as a as a cyclist you always have spine
flexion<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.390> now<00:02:22.569> you're<00:02:22.689> trying<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.959> get<00:02:23.049> that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
flexion so now you're trying to get that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.780 
flexion so now you're trying to get that
extension<00:02:23.439> and<00:02:23.829> open<00:02:24.159> that<00:02:24.189> up<00:02:24.459> open<00:02:24.760> your

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
extension and open that up open your

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.759 
extension and open that up open your
chest<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.420> reverse<00:02:26.079> some<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.500> stuff<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
chest and reverse some of the stuff that

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.099 
chest and reverse some of the stuff that
you<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.250> with<00:02:27.519> all<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.970> cycling<00:02:28.659> and<00:02:28.900> it's

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
you get with all that cycling and it's

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.770 
you get with all that cycling and it's
really<00:02:29.500> hard<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.950> stabilize<00:02:30.700> when<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.390> really

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
really hard to stabilize when you really

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.869 
really hard to stabilize when you really
out<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:31.959> breath<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.590> as<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.189> cyclist<00:02:33.519> you're

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
out of breath and as a cyclist you're

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.460 
out of breath and as a cyclist you're
going<00:02:34.120> downhill<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.689> you<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.049> hold<00:02:35.230> on

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
going downhill and you have to hold on

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.309 
going downhill and you have to hold on
really<00:02:35.739> tight<00:02:35.939> so<00:02:36.939> you<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.629> to<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
really tight so you have to be in a

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.199 
really tight so you have to be in a
stable<00:02:38.590> position<00:02:38.890> after<00:02:39.640> you've<00:02:40.060> worked

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
stable position after you've worked

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.390 
stable position after you've worked
really<00:02:40.359> hard<00:02:40.540> climb<00:02:40.930> now<00:02:41.109> so<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.370> know

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
really hard climb now so that's you know

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.190 
really hard climb now so that's you know
it's<00:02:42.730> really<00:02:42.939> valid<00:02:43.359> now<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.870> back<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.049> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
it's really valid now it's back to a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.780 
it's really valid now it's back to a
power<00:02:44.500> exercised<00:02:46.170> dumbbell<00:02:47.170> snatches<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:48.010> go

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
power exercised dumbbell snatches you go

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.430 
power exercised dumbbell snatches you go
into<00:02:49.030> about<00:02:49.299> five<00:02:49.540> or<00:02:49.720> six<00:02:49.930> each<00:02:50.290> arm<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
into about five or six each arm and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.319 
into about five or six each arm and
you'll<00:02:53.440> notice<00:02:53.799> i<00:02:54.040> know<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.639> familiar<00:02:55.299> with

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
you'll notice i know it is familiar with

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.619 
you'll notice i know it is familiar with
its<00:02:55.750> lon<00:02:56.310> jarek<00:02:57.310> i<00:02:57.579> think<00:02:58.030> that's<00:02:58.150> his<00:02:58.269> name<00:02:58.450> is

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
its lon jarek i think that's his name is

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.220 
its lon jarek i think that's his name is
from<00:02:58.810> your<00:02:59.290> work<00:02:59.500> i<00:02:59.680> have<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.700> link<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.599> he

from your work i have to link to this he

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.679 
from your work i have to link to this he
has<00:03:02.379> some<00:03:02.650> really<00:03:02.859> cool<00:03:03.220> barbell<00:03:04.030> complexes

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
has some really cool barbell complexes

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.349 
has some really cool barbell complexes
this<00:03:04.840> one<00:03:04.989> javac<00:03:05.739> complexes<00:03:06.609> i'm<00:03:06.939> probably

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
this one javac complexes i'm probably

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.879 
this one javac complexes i'm probably
butchering<00:03:07.750> his<00:03:07.900> name<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.290> apologize<00:03:08.859> for

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.800 
butchering his name and I apologize for
that<00:03:09.159> but<00:03:09.730> it's<00:03:09.909> you<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:10.420> exercise

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
that but it's you know one exercise

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.330 
that but it's you know one exercise
right<00:03:11.200> into<00:03:11.439> the<00:03:11.530> next<00:03:11.859> he's<00:03:11.980> kind<00:03:12.189> of<00:03:12.220> like

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
right into the next he's kind of like

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.399 
right into the next he's kind of like
the<00:03:12.459> grandfather<00:03:12.909> of<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.420> complex<00:03:14.109> even

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
the grandfather of the complex even

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.420 
the grandfather of the complex even
there's<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.620> lot<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.799> people<00:03:15.099> doing<00:03:15.280> them<00:03:15.400> now

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
there's a lot of people doing them now

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.150 
there's a lot of people doing them now
but<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.389> almost<00:03:17.169> like<00:03:17.260> mixed<00:03:17.620> modality

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
but this is a almost like mixed modality

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.689 
but this is a almost like mixed modality
so<00:03:18.639> now<00:03:19.209> we're<00:03:19.359> going<00:03:19.510> into<00:03:20.310> dumbbell<00:03:21.310> presses

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
so now we're going into dumbbell presses

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.720 
so now we're going into dumbbell presses
so<00:03:22.329> this<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.510> strength<00:03:23.139> again<00:03:23.829> back<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.250> power

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
so this is strength again back to power

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.599 
so this is strength again back to power
and<00:03:25.090> now<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:25.690> strength<00:03:26.379> we<00:03:26.859> started<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.370> first

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
and now to strength we started the first

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.059 
and now to strength we started the first
series<00:03:27.909> with<00:03:28.239> lower<00:03:28.449> body<00:03:28.829> essentially<00:03:29.829> and

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
series with lower body essentially and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.460 
series with lower body essentially and
this<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.340> upper<00:03:30.699> body<00:03:30.909> but<00:03:31.599> we<00:03:31.720> don't<00:03:31.959> want<00:03:32.169> too

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this is upper body but we don't want too

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.369 
this is upper body but we don't want too
much<00:03:32.849> upper<00:03:33.849> body<00:03:33.959> building<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.139> we're<00:03:35.260> not

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
much upper body building so we're not

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.839 
much upper body building so we're not
going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.620> do<00:03:35.680> bodybuilding<00:03:36.489> for<00:03:36.639> the<00:03:36.699> upper

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
going to do bodybuilding for the upper

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.089 
going to do bodybuilding for the upper
body<00:03:37.030> especially<00:03:37.239> for<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.810> cyclist<00:03:38.590> they<00:03:38.949> don't

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
body especially for a cyclist they don't

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.770 
body especially for a cyclist they don't
want<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.370> extra<00:03:39.609> bulk<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.419> upper<00:03:40.599> body

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
want that extra bulk in the upper body

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.849 
want that extra bulk in the upper body
you<00:03:40.900> want<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.109> actually<00:03:41.199> be<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.590> light<00:03:41.829> as

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
you want to actually be as light as

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.009 
you want to actually be as light as
possible<00:03:42.129> as<00:03:42.699> a<00:03:42.760> cyclist<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.629> we're<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:43.840> going

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
possible as a cyclist so we're not going

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.500 
possible as a cyclist so we're not going
to<00:03:44.079> do<00:03:44.199> a<00:03:44.229> bunch<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:45.190> bunch<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.819> push-ups<00:03:46.060> and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
to do a bunch of a bunch of push-ups and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.780 
to do a bunch of a bunch of push-ups and

a<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:51.419> guess<00:03:52.419> another<00:03:52.780> stability<00:03:53.409> exercise<00:03:53.859> of

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
a I guess another stability exercise of

a I guess another stability exercise of
any<00:03:55.150> kind<00:03:55.449> of<00:03:55.629> plank<00:03:55.930> variation<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.799> what

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
do in a fatigue state like this I can do

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.949 
do in a fatigue state like this I can do
it<00:04:05.169> really<00:04:05.409> well<00:04:05.560> when<00:04:06.489> I'm<00:04:06.790> fresh<00:04:07.299> but<00:04:07.810> now
