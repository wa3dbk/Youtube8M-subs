00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.210
 warrior because with me is nothing 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.339
 week as far as I can, I alex saw it 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 for me already about three months 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.399
 A little over three months ago 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.599
 that I had my next glacier 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.210
 and accordingly I have too 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.570
 really much over the top is 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.410
 Thick it is rocking frizzy is easy 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.570
 just a lot 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.829
 and before I get my relaxed before 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.120
 me just a few things with it me 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.129
 For example , from known burns 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.280
 Crackles of my scalp are not irritated 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.499
 will and do not matter so things 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.699
 stop and just a few more tips for 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:47.230
 you and I just start that way 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.120
 The first thing I do is about one and a half 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.249
 weeks but at least a week from 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 my lexar media are thoroughly closed 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.510
 I'll wash as much extra-time 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.780
 in between, the scalp has time 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:04.570
 be trained again regenerate so 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.540
 and again to form skin flakes 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.690
 so that the relax is not so easy in the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.130
 can bring in scalp and so fast 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.200
 can cause burns 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.930
 and before my lecturer I wash my 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.280
 hair with the criminal arno scolding of and 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.220
 the ex team leader's hair 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.700
 grow with the orient is the label 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 relax know that these fabrics are also in 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 the pack is about the delicious 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.680
 to wash out so that's it 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.260
 neutralization of and clarifying 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.090
 shampoos and if you look at that 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.010
 hair which really pulls everything up 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 the hair is now just down oil 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.360
 product what do I know what all comes up 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.060
 any case with that already down 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.100
 I use this either only 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.480
 from my relaxe or generally once 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 a month just my hair 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.860
 really free from all 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.240
 I'm on it, that's it 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.070
 really product remnants away 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.870
 Neutralizes moisturizes all 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.430
 I recommend you through this 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.600
 to use shampoo once a week 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.520
 because that's really a lot of hair 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 can dry out because 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 as I said everything on the hair 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.520
 teach the side what I do in the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.090
 week before I get my lexa resp 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.860
 Do not rest is me to scratch 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.770
 It happens that the suitcases then 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 Sometime put itches and then wants 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.650
 Immediately you place the cat 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.700
 but I will not do because by the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 the skin will sting 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.220
 raised or removed and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 the job is then more sensitive and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.670
 if you get the calculator then 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 could that be that the index on 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.580
 the place comes and then you tend to 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.900
 to get burned at this point 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.540
 That's why I do not do that because of it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.750
 every time if any place on mine 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.260
 head skin really itches 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.940
 just look at my fingers and massage the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.430
 tribes until it stops living 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.450
 and carry on with what I did 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.120
 started 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.160
 but that is really important if 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.710
 avoid that you burn 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.110
 the third guy i get you 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.720
 There is no bobby pins to give 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.490
 I do not use that tension 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.460
 or similar because the example 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.090
 the tips as when scratching the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.770
 Lift or remove the skin scales 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.700
 and at this point be stop 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.209
 Of course, the more sensitive it is 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.550
 In any case, he can then the exter there 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.400
 also just go and you burn yourself 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.720
 so no, no later this week 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.730
 One thing I relish before me 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.010
 do it to comb my hair like that 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.980
 Similar to scratching the scalp 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.090
 the teeth of him came in, too 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.340
 the scalp and lift it 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.560
 skin fleas away so far away 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.120
 you then put these to yourself too 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.920
 burn simply because the relaxed 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.230
 loading is faster and easier on the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.610
 scalp arrives and accordingly 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.770
 can react faster with the head 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.760
 and that's why I'm doing it in then 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.440
 the week just my fingers 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.050
 take it and then go through my hair 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.620
 also through my approach during mine 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.320
 daily routine for example with the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.030
 you just moisturizer by the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.590
 approach and unravel the beautiful 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.530
 that one then on the day of the nile about the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.210
 hair can easily share 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.110
 Another tip from me 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.290
 your hair is not too tight to style 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:24.240
 so not too thirst thirsty no ten 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.890
 Do not unbundle horses' tails like that 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.530
 What stop because otherwise your head has 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.000
 then put under tension and that 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.210
 makes the suitcase very sensitive and 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.610
 then irritates the heating oil easily if 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.490
 her then the lexar order I have 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.700
 now in there but that's just 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:46.290
 very lightly bound so I remark 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:51.660
 believe twice then rum then every two 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:55.260
 three days he three days oil i mean 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.870
 scalp with olive oil so you have to 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.630
 But drink your suitcases with the practice of oil 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.390
 I 'll pick up some olive oil 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.450
 my fingertips and what each time 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.150
 my scalp a that my scalp 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.400
 practically like a greasy baic 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.500
 gets the driveway protects from the relax 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.960
 There is also the band in the relax in 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.720
 a lexa pack in it but most of it 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.340
 what vaseline is similar and mostly 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.950
 but applied around the head but 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.290
 the oil then shoots additionally and 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.450
 That's what I do on the day of the relax 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.540
 So before I get my last 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.730
 that I just with a bit of oil 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.620
 about the complicated is very important 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.780
 that you did not attack the approach with oil 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.880
 but really only the scalp should 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.820
 now my last and I believe one 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.520
 the most important tips yes one of the 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.870
 most important for me in any case 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:56.460
 day of relax you take back the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.850
 coconut oil or olive oil and bild.de 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.120
 part of the already long is one with the oil 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.800
 what you have chosen you can do 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.600
 namely happen that you during then 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.160
 want to get extra for example at 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.560
 distribute so relax on the 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.090
 hair tips come you do not want that 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.540
 we last on the hair tips comes 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:19.020
 and the hair tips again relaxed so 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.050
 Smoothes because that leads to that 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.220
 the hair is slowing down 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.020
 may take a while 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.659
 next video of me comes before 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.949
 the whole friday but my stress 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.139
 next video is a definitely 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.530
 relax update where I have my hair 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.750
 smoothly show and tell how to walk like that 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.220
 is and then I think that will be easy 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.900
 Everybody wants to come regularly when I am 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.940
 a way said that a relax update 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.770
 I wish you in any case 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.580

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.710
