00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.410
 the national park of the capybara is 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.830
 a conservation unit embedded in the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.820
 rich in plant species and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.680
 animals 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.129
 the biome caatinga exclusively 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.809
 Brazilian is the semi-arid region 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.809
 rich in biodiversity of the planet 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.890
 this is a geological boundary region 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.500
 and ecological with the past to historical 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.530
 with a rugged relief that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.530
 compose landscapes of respectable beauty 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:30.210
 i support capivara serrano national park 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.549
 was also the first park to be 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.549
 created within the caatinga biome 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.069
 but although we are in a region of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.569
 caatinga between valleys and 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.420
 people have already found remnants of the forest 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.039
 Atlantic and here we see the example in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.990
 Cauldron of the gameleira 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.590
 this immense gameleira that is a remnant 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 of the Atlantic Forest 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.689
 by means of adequate and efficient management 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.209
 in this conservation unit are 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.720
 protected more than 300 species of 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.500
 vertebrates like mocÃ³ duck tail cavy 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.500
 dry aunts endangered the ounce 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.690
 the largest predator in the region have 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.470
 satisfactory conditions have been found for 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.470
 its reproduction 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.400
 it was in 1963 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.319
 nr had the first information on 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.819
 the cave paintings of the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.130
 capybara 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.950
 without being able to reach the place by car for 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.880
 cause of the heavy rains and is 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.950
 piau in 1970 when he photographs five 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 shelters with paintings in 1973 here wave 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.630
 returns the piauÃ­ with a frank mission 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.209
 and soon afterwards the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.510
 of the stoned stone where he found 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.120
 coal samples of 18 thousand years 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.640
 until then the most 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.310
 dating back to 11,000 years 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.310
 and were found in the new Mexico 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.680
 very difficult conditions due to the 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.709
 extreme lack of local resources 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.560
 the team excavated and discovered numerous 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.739
 places where no one had stepped on 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.920
 hundreds of years what they discovered 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.420
 helped him rewrite the history of 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.420
 arrival of man the americas 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.510
 all these discoveries led to the saw 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.310
 of the capybara to be considered as patrimony 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.310
 cultural heritage of mankind by unesco
