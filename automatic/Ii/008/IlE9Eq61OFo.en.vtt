00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
but sometimes games don't fall into the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.460 
but sometimes games don't fall into the
simple<00:00:22.919> binary<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.460> good<00:00:23.849> or<00:00:24.150> bad<00:00:24.470> sometimes

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
simple binary of good or bad sometimes

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.140 
simple binary of good or bad sometimes
it's<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:25.980> more<00:00:26.130> blurry<00:00:26.519> than<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it's a little more blurry than that it

it's a little more blurry than that it
may<00:00:27.929> sound<00:00:28.199> weird<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> beginning<00:00:29.399> middle

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
may sound weird but the beginning middle

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.579

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
and end of the game can all end up being

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.680 
and end of the game can all end up being
radically<00:00:32.340> different<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.149> far<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.450> game

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
radically different as far as game

fell asleep I don't remember why I was

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.150 
fell asleep I don't remember why I was
so<00:00:48.300> taken<00:00:48.629> by<00:00:48.929> this<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.679> one<00:00:49.920> thing

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so taken by this game but one thing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680 
so taken by this game but one thing
that's<00:00:50.280> clear<00:00:50.519> is<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that's clear is that something about it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.509 
that's clear is that something about it
left<00:00:51.839> a<00:00:51.899> weird<00:00:52.140> impression<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.829> me<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
left a weird impression on me the

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.220 
left a weird impression on me the
problem<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> couldn't<00:00:54.809> put<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.109> finger

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
problem is that I couldn't put my finger

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.459 
problem is that I couldn't put my finger
on<00:00:55.679> exactly<00:00:55.710> why<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.059> remember<00:00:57.839> that<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.019> really

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
on exactly why I remember that I really

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.040 
on exactly why I remember that I really
liked<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.219> also<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.390> hated<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
liked it but also that I really hated it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.560 
liked it but also that I really hated it
how<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> possible<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> name

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
how can that be possible so in the name

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.360 
how can that be possible so in the name
of<00:01:03.600> science<00:01:04.050> I<00:01:04.170> decided<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> replay<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> whole

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
of science I decided to replay the whole

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.220 
of science I decided to replay the whole
game<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.000> solidify<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.750> thoughts<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
game and solidify my thoughts on it

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.290 
game and solidify my thoughts on it
instead<00:01:07.440> of<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.740> saying<00:01:08.250> oh<00:01:08.460> yeah<00:01:08.670> able<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300

there are quite a few negatives to this
game<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.330> mean<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.930> extremely<00:01:46.920> buggy<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
game I mean it's extremely buggy and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340 
game I mean it's extremely buggy and
even<00:01:48.150> after<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.660> patches<00:01:48.870> there<00:01:49.260> are

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
even after all the patches there are

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
even after all the patches there are
still<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.980> too<00:01:50.040> many<00:01:50.490> glitches<00:01:50.760> that<00:01:50.970> really

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
still way too many glitches that really

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.680 
still way too many glitches that really
slow<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> game<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.220> dog<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.880> horrible
