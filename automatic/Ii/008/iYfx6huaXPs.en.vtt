00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.200
The Elves and the Shoemaker

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.283
Retold by BookBox

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.033
Although Peter Schumaker

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.617
worked hard

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:33.700
and was kind

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.950
to everyone in the village,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.700
he could never earn

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.617
enough money

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:42.367
making shoes.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.783
On this particularly cold and snowy day,

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:48.280
all he had left in his workroom

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.360
was enough leather to make

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.440
one last pair of shoes.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.783
That evening,

00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:57.700
Peter carefully cut up

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700
his precious leather

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.940
and laid it aside

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.780
for the morning

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.540
when he would sew them together.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.800
The sun rose the next morning,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.200
and Peter was ready

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.033
to start work,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.450
but to his great surprise,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.200
sat on his

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.700
worktable,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.367
pair of shoes

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:27.200
exquisitely crafted.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.617
“What magic!” said Cecilia,

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:32.450
his wife. They quickly put the shoes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.783
in the shop window,

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:36.783
for the holiday shopping season

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:40.367
had just begun.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:41.783
As luck would have it,

00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:43.950
the shoes perfectly  fitted

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.783
the finicky Mrs. Sniggins.

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:47.700
She paid a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.860
generous sum for the fine fit.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.280
With the money,

00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:56.700
Peter went to buy more leather,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.200
enough for

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.450
two more pairs!

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.867
That evening,

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:03.700
he once again set to work

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700
cutting his leather

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.783
and he left the pieces on the table

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:11.950
when he went to bed.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.940
Hoping for a good design,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.280
he fell asleep dreaming

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:32.360
of shoes.

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.283
When he awoke early,

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.283
the next morning,

00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:38.117
he again found

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.880
two finely crafted pairs of shoes before his eyes.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.700
two finely crafted pairs of shoes before his eyes.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.617
Customers

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.617
bought these up quickly.

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:50.450
they were masterpieces.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.200
Now Peter could

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.283
buy enough leather

00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:57.200
for four pairs of shoes.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.283
This magical business went on

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:00.867
for some time

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.450
and Schumaker’s name

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.867
became well-known

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.617
for the finest shoes  in town.

00:03:05.617 --> 00:03:07.950
for the finest shoes  in town.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.200
These days life was much better

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.283
for Peter and Cecilia.

00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:18.200
One day Cecilia said:

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.117
“I wonder who has been

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.780
helping us so much?”

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:26.533
Peter announced:

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:27.783
“Tonight

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.117
we will hide in the workshop

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:33.783
and see what goes on there!”

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:36.283
And so they did.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:39.700
At exactly midnight,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.867
two tiny

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.867
elves tiptoed in

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.450
and began to work

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.783
swiftly making

00:03:46.783 --> 00:03:51.617
the fine shoes!

00:03:51.617 --> 00:03:52.950
They were

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.600
shabbily dressed

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.960
and weren’t even wearing shoes themselves.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.360
and weren’t even wearing shoes themselves.

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:02.117
Before daybreak

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.533
they had already dashed off,

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:05.700
leaving several

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.533
pairs of shoes ready

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:11.283
for sale that day.

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:12.283
Peter and Cecilia

00:04:12.283 --> 00:04:14.033
were grateful to these

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.533
little elves

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:17.283
and worried about them

00:04:17.283 --> 00:04:19.117
working so hard

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:24.700
in such cold weather.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.283
So Peter set to work

00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:27.450
So Peter set to work

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.867
making two tiny pairs

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.617
of shoes

00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:32.367
and Cecilia stitched two

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:33.950
warm sets of clothing

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.950
for each of them.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.867
On Christmas Eve,

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:41.033
instead of leather pieces,

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:42.617
they set

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:45.033
the little shoes and clothes

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:50.033
out and hid themselves again.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:53.783
At midnight,

00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:56.867
the elves popped in

00:04:56.867 --> 00:05:02.033
and saw the new clothes.

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:03.867
In a flash, they had them

00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:08.700
on their little bodies!

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.283
They were so happy

00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:12.950
that they laughed and chuckled

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.283
and danced right out the window

00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:19.867
and danced right out the window

00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:20.950
never to be seen again.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.200
never to be seen again.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.617
Peter continued making

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.033
shoes everyday,

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:29.283
and he and Cecilia

00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:30.533
lived a very happy and contented life for many years.

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:33.450
lived a very happy and contented life for many years.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.117
As did the elves!
