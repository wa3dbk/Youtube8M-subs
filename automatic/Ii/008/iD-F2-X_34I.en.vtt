 today in Mexico, the truth is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.829
 the only truth that exists because it is 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.360
 where we have this large amount of 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.800
 classes were by nothing other than 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.930
 it's the pure class that they go to school 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.820
