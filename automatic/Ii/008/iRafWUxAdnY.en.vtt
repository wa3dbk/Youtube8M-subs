00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.209
 today that the production of cartoons has become very sophisticated 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.210
 thanks to the new electronic techniques it is interesting to know their 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.159
 modest beginnings and discover unknown aspects of its history 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.460
 the beginnings of animation films are not limited to North America and Europe 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.769
 western 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.239
 in 1917 twenty years before the production of snow white from udis min 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.300
 the Argentinean quirino cristiani created the first animated feature film 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.840
 the prehistory of the cartoons dates from the last century that goes back to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.630
 the Chinese shadows 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.429
 but nevertheless 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.270
 or in Argentina where the first feature film miss monagas was filmed in 1917 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
 fatherhood corresponded quirino cristiani 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.490
 feature film was titled support 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.510
 unlike the previous drawings that were exhibited in the cinema Iman 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.920
 in figures this film of cristian and portillo 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 before the apostle cristiani had worked with a cinematic siero 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.020
 that produced ovalle federico 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 there I got angry for every issue a political caricature of current events 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.080
 it's something punctual 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.030
 then common 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 a drip of brown lignite we choose movement 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.320
 a goal for a minute 5 the automobile producer serve as they a

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.229
 greece did not find the way to the wind is a woman without children 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.070
 trunk diseases occur 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.690
 then the science in the books of others 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.280
 the nation still managed to move a finger 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 without explanation sometimes but not if they were a true revolution 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.710
 collapsed on a round table with the director modified the rates more 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.890
 high figures 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.230
 while with a more balanced diet marcelo polino 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.370
 what indicates his work either with articulated figures 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.299
 or with figures with 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.299
 gildardo happen from his plant in the other not 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.899
 Argentina 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.469
 to play a meeting with a cumulative like all animation 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.449
 artisan animation 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.229
 four by four 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.369
 quirino cristiani design and a system without any relationship with the techniques 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:26.639
 of animation of that time or the current one has to invent a 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.969
 machine 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.909
 everything he does alone 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.809
 he has a series of pedals 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:37.339
 per cent manifested what he said whenever he handled it as 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.579
 selector 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.259
 the producer federico valle contract for the feature film angiogenesis 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:44.010
 addressed 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.010
 a political cartoonist who designed the characters 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.389
 and the architect Andrés ducó who made the model for the sequence of a 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.269
 fire 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.859
 the theme of the apostle was curious within the political satire the president of 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.980
 that time he went up to heaven and asked for permission to cleanse the corruption of the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.969
 congress and all levels of government 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.119
 the cleaning operation consisted of setting fire to good air tote caught fire 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.259
 at the end it is not drawn in and animated 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.140
 but it is a fire 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.209
 of this great model that venezuela is that of buenos aires 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.209
 and that has a great impact on the public 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.499
 the film was very successful and it remained almost a year in billboard 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:30.729
 It took a year for the Christian to produce the 58 thousand drawings that made up a thousand 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.809
 700 meters of film for an hour and a half of tests 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.599
 some consider that cartoons have two stages before and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.169
 after Christian 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.389
 under 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.169
 cristian heredia 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.540
 stories add anecdotes add situations 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.599
 the success of the apostle was not repeated 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.059
 In 1918, Cristiani made the second feature film in the history of 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.630
 kidnapped by the police the day of the premiere 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.380
 for reasons of high diplomacy of 29 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.639
 Christianity envelops 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.339
 to his cinematographic activity neither 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:11.739
 and makes a new cartoon movie the most hairy country hike 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.519
 it was another failure that almost ruined Christianity then he dedicated himself to doing 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.930
 scientific and advertising films spent a long period attack 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.740
 cristian u returned 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.699
 to their activity where they taught thoracic cartoons 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.169
 this time it was a short film that was shown to the public in 1938 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.259
 the writer 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.459
 the owner of a very important editorial the Argentine editorial atlántida 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.969
 according to the cis 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.279
 and the very successful bull of stories for boys of books for boys 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:47.439
 lush 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.249
 to produce a movie about one of the books 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.020
 Most successful of constancio vigil 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.610
 laugh the watchmaker monkey 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.300
 cristiani abandon this film their technique of the cut-out figures and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.300
 employs the acetate technique disseminated by students 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.530
 in 1941 he premiered saints and in Argentina 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.159
 at that time your child is not Christian 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.900
 the strawberry go to work 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.680
 has been with the photos of the singer 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.000
 but another official of the sample sticks company laboratory work 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.460
 certainly he could not leave everything he had good airs 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.949
 writing is cristian and the history of cinema has been difficult the first 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.560
 feature film that featured the history of cinema was white 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.659
 snows of 1936 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:37.419
 the battle 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.719
 It was pretty hard 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.550
 because in the cepal zarba 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.879
 a frame of the movie 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.879
 most of the hard work and has been lost 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.680
 and it has been lost in a very curious way because 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.420
 the others had what these films were made of reveals copies 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.169
 Silver nitrate was highly coveted by the Pemex factories 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.960
 then all those rolls have been cast to make tractors in which 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.889
 several generations of Argentines we have been punished for the same thing that 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.520
 practice this 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.430
 with the movies of Christianity 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.919
 quirino cristiani definitively abandoned all relationship with the 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.060
 cinematographic activity after these fires one in 1957 and another in 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.500
 1962 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.050
 they destroyed all their negative positive work 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.360
 original drawings and notes 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.389
 I think the importance and christian mile 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.629
 is the fact that a person a boy we would say 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.619
 of 17 18 years 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:36.680
 in a country 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.949
 a tribute to our side 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.639
 I am very far from the center 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.520
 production 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.369
 invents really 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.699
 one technique one system 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.520
 unique exclusive 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.030
 and directly from nothing
