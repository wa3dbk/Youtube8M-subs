00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.820
 this time we will paint this design 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.029
 on the wall 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.509
 the material that we will use will be two 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.750
 paint cans paint shaker 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:32.610
 container and roller two brushes tape 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.640
 Measuring level plastic can opener 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.559
 to cover the floor and finally the most 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 important to be able to get a good 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.420
 finish we must select the tape 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.490
 masking tape make your most appropriate 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 for your need for this job of 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.500
 two tonalities we will use the tape 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.410
 masking tape 140 for surfaces 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.330
 delicate and outlined can also be 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.670
 Support our selection guide 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.680
 tape masking tape for different 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.690
 application surfaces 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.340
 first we mark the distances where 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.460
 they will take the separation of colors from 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.460
 painting 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.520
 once marked we proceed to mask 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.710
 with masking tape 140 joining point 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.900
 to point to get a line 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.729
 straight you can also use said 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.040
 tape to protect the switches 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.040
 wooden frames and aluminum windows 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.250
 now we proceed to empty the paint in 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.250
 the recipients of your choice 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 Now we can start painting as 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.159
 can see the tape helps us foresee 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.189
 the paint filtration and allows us 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.500
 a straight delineation when we finished 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.619
 painting this area we can remove the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.020
 tape we should try to remove them in a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.840
 90 degree angle to the wall 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
 and preferably when the painting is still 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.360
 It's cool to avoid brazen 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.130
 pl we put tape again on top 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.260
 of the second brand 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.810
 later right at the edge of the area 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.209
 painted it does not matter that the painting still 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.600
 be cool since our tape truck 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.430
 it is special for this use now we can 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.430
 start painting with the other color 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.340
 Now that we've finished painting with 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.380
 our second color we can remove 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.730
 the whole tape 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.280
 remember to do it at an angle of 90 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.590
 degrees with respect to the wall and of 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.660
 preference when the painting is still 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.660
 cool to avoid being ruined pl 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.780
 As you can see, there are no borders between 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.560
 different shades of paint this 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.720
 thanks to the thinness of the ribbon paper 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.350
 ready it's easier to do it with the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.350
 you tape
