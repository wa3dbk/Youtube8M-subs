00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.340
 Can a VAZ dozen equipped 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.349
 VAZ motor 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.709
 on equal footing there were a quarter 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.229
 february camaro 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:14.319
 in which under the hood of a ten-liter 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.390
 nine-year nitrous oxide injection system 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.439
 it turns out maybe if this ten 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.169
 team lukoil raisa how come what 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.680
 lukoil began to participate in 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.110
 projects in general ring teams but 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.449
 when super tourism closed down 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.310
 the team has two left 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.629
 cars in the morning dozens of which in general 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.870
 turned out to be useless 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.100
 at the same time they did a pun show the second time 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.440
 further track ischo enthusiasts 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.740
 who built 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.360
 m in this car rotary engine 2 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.710
 time did these motors and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.970
 it turned out that for racing rotary 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.550
 vase engine fits much 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.270
 better than March rotary engine 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.700
 really some parts 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.380
 Russian motor report all the same 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.440
 present in this engine but not 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.539
 less basis 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.900
 This vazovsky bad 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.590
 what turned out was about 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.360
 four hundred horsepower if used 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.380
 nitrous oxide injection system 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.970
 the engine was rearranged and back in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.860
 share a rear wheel drive car that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.670
 Overall much better for drag racing 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.560
 however, soon the guys had to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.700
 move the engine back forward because 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.450
 something 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.270
 just had no rivals in this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.550
 classroom 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.720
 this car is a front wheel drive window 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.410
 true guys do not lose heart because 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.050
 if necessary, then all the fixing became 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.650
 water left 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.710
 on the spot so demand transfer 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.430
 the engine is back no 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.560
 difficulties 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.740
 gearbox naturally klochkova 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.850
 french firm sao g naturally system 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.619
 Nitrous oxide injection and here is Alexey 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.860
 blew she hardly ever come to that 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.390
 he will pass a dozen on which at the end 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.180
 defeated will now be worn across the battlefield 24 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.000
 September 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.140
 this is another 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.510
 in very wonderful nice 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.850
 let the project 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.909
 lukoil racing because they proved that 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.319
 it's not just money 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.569
 and only in a huge engine if 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.429
 you can attach a goal and skillful hands 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.429
 make for very little money 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.769
 very interesting 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.429
 all the same again I remind you 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.319
 domestic a dozen static 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.529
 motor 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.939
 one such funny bonus is that he 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:16.819
 great 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.989
 update back anatoly 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.719
 rearrange 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.189
 it seemed an opportunity 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.349
 installations 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.469
 because dreams 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.019
 interferes left 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.779
 this motor is time to put back 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.049
 accurate 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.409
 imitate the work of transmissions 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.419
 and please do you get to honor 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.989
 thousands of families all-wheel drive 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.969
 car weighing 790 kilograms then 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.369
 no one will allow this car for sure 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:41.749
 true bye 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.749
 this project remains the project only 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.399
 because in Russia there is simply no such 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.029
 infinite class 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.859
 but without two engines this car goes 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.480
 so breathtaking 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.089
 sound of one engine 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.579
 makes a noise so in general people have to 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.570
 plug ears 130 decibels 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.570
 listen to 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.139
 GDP 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.120
 m 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.310
 since the car is now 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.549
 front wheel drive mounted in front 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.830
 special networking rules are enough 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.589
 soft 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.399
 pressure to do and small for 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.399
 improved grip can be seen even as they 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.399
 a little bit of class at the start 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.799
 the rear wheels are narrow and inflated 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.689
 high pressure just to 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.309
 they rolled easier 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.129
 in order to accelerate faster 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.949
 must have a powerful motor on one side 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.599
 on the other hand, as little as possible. 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.069
 because acceleration is straight 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.619
 proportionally 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:53.869
 family I attach 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.739
 body during acceleration and back 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.429
 proportional to the mass in order to 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:59.459
 the car became as light as possible out of it 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.039
 deleted everything that was possible 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.479
 remove and many fall naturally 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.479
 replaced 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.359
 no fiberglass 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.229
 the same groundhog market replaced 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.319
 polycarbonate it is very light at the same time 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.539
 the easiest way was 790 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.499
 kilogram 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.579
 very small indicator 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.780
 because for example 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.019
 most powerful cars most 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.180
 large with huge motors as a rule 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.189
 10 tons more 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.189
 This alone gives this high one 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.679
 dozens pretty noticeable 

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:30.680
 advantage 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 unfortunately we do not know indicators 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.930
 then when she was registered 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.189
 front wheel drive measurements were taken 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.409
 and that's what happened overclocking to 100 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.520
 kilometers per hour the sight of 54 hundredths 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.039
 seconds 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.029
 ten people 84 hundredths of a second 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:54.370
 and the best result 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.669
 402 meters / quarter mile distance 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.669
 time 11 point 35 hundredths of a second 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.960
 finish speed more than two hundred 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.509
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.650
 These are the results of 2007 when this car 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.339
 started participating over competitions and 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.169
 six serious competitions four 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.389
 first place and one gathering on technology one 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.580
 second place 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.930
 2008 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.780
 out of nine serious papers 8 wins and one 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.340
 third place including first place in 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.940
 Moscow Cup competitions in 2008 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.440
 third place at the Grand Prix of Moscow 2008 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.370
 won the title of champions of Russia 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.900
 drag racing speed stopper
