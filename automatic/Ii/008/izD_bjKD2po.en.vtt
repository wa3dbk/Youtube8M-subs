00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 Hello to you again Alexander 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.070
 and today I would like to talk to you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.079
 about the firmware that everyone knows and 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.649
 name viper x 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.530
 that I would like to say this 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.870
 what you don't want to change for anything 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.150
 other 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.449
 why because everything works so much 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.230
 perfect what really hands and yes i'm 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.680
 have already missed such use 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 before the phone of course everyone understands the model 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.399
 already old color podlagivat and say 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 that everywhere but no matter where something is 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:04.140
 slips here such an option yes I 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.770
 for a long time did not even see my wife who 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 does not understand all of these flashing 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.929
 asked me what if i shoot 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 any other reviews further than this 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:18.810
 the phone so I don't have this firmware 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.159
 even restored it to her very 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.619
 I like what is there 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.020
 work so fast and so all 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.320
 perfect everything quickly opens here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.369
 there are no complaints at all 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.960
 hangs 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.570
 also there are no reboots and speech even in this 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.299
 no at least i didn't have it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.540
 what is there added again 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.840
 tweaks from m7 that is, we can with you 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.860
 now move the signal to the left 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.979
 I like this view very comfortable right away 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 changes the way the phone looks like 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.509
 let's say here in this version like 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.269
 more than all of this we have collected the top 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.260
 right corner there are also some more 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.240
 trivia tweaks tweet in Russian 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 so dwell on not 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 them in detail and i won't be huge 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.310
 number of settings I will not get tired 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.360
 repeat can customize one or the other 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.700
 option but just for yourself something 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:45.630
 find further this keyboard keyboard 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:49.860
 The keyboard from sense 6.0 we look 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:54.510
 please here it is for your attention further 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.910
 task manager and ce 6.0 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.730
 as you naturally see he has here 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.890
 such an appearance can be closed 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.720
 all applications are completely one tank 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.710
 but not at all, that is, I can't talk about it 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.160
 not say but some users 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.410
 sites about where they say that when 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.890
 switching tracks with volume buttons 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.400
 it raises the volume and switches the track 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.280
 I don't have it, I tell you honestly 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.520
 Again , yes, in fact, that is, someone does not have 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 but if suddenly you say goodbye keep in mind 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:41.790
 what is a god you can be pure 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.310
 on my own I want to say I would be here 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.340
 did not change anything that is not 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.590
 experimented on what they say 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.250
 developers, what's new is not worth waiting 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.250
 but if some bugs appear 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.400
 then they will naturally be corrected by 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.610
 as far as possible i find it cool but 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.740
 something global I haven't done 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.140
 because the phone behaves 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.390
 really cool about the battery and 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.610
 I will say because I have already killed her 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:17.770
 my phone really holds little 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:21.770
 that is, it needs to be changed but again 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:26.060
 judging by the reviews everything just works 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.280
 great and keeps decent say so 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.880
 battery 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.800
 now tests tests let me show you 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.860
 you won't do it i just forgot 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.430
 download so how do you know doing it 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.980
 so long we will do without him for a long time 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.730
 did not see such a result honestly 13 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:51.680
 something 14 something indicators here 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.950
 shows 15800 6th core never 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.890
 I overclock when I do the test 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:03.190
 so this indicator has not seen for a long time 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:06.710
 honestly go on Bismarch vs2 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:12.260
 results results are worthy 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:16.490
 there are for fans of numbers ok i think you 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:21.250
 You will be satisfied with such 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:25.540
 indicators and Bismarck x 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:30.380
 5118 this test we have 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:33.620
 tests gaming performance all 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.150
 very cool in principle to say something 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:41.500
 nothing more the camera naturally has 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:46.370
 old appearance nissens 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.530
 6.0 but photographs with dignity as well 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.630
 I don't have it right now 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.060
 flash drives 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.870
 flash drive also when connected by phone 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.380
 100 g through the cord everything works who this 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:04.640
 enjoys my complaints 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.960
 no firmware download use me 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.350
 I advise 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.880
 honestly who loves sens i advise 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:17.750
 This firmware is better not yet and I think 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.360
 what will be gone for it all with you was 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.550
