00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 hello with you android android 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.780
 today wanted to talk about online action 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.470
 and the tank what is the name of the villa tanks 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 online 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.520
 This game itself is a copy of the game. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 here of tanks 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.460
 By the way it seems that although this is from 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.369
 tank did not play but in appearance very 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.170
 very similar here is our tank which is worn 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.480
 in stock 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.120
 we can use different tanks in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.020
 here's another battle another tank yes 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.480
 you can delete the camera as we can here 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.590
 we have a little hangar game 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.930
 completely in Russian there is a shop 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.289
 various information pieces 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.210
 clarify we can buy more first aid kits here 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.620
 we can still buy 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 tank factory even here you can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.899
 see information from the tanks 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.470
 We were honored to have much experience 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.040
 which we earn by fighting 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.049
 also here are some here is our level our 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.979
 flags but it will then open 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.189
 gradually and let's try to say so 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.930
 hold a fight push battle with us 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.509
 loading is going on let's wait 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.509
 while we boot 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.509
 here 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.710
 well here we are loaded from us going 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.200
 loading the map here are our rivals 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.520
 we allies get it green it's me 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.799
 but the color there is our enemies we need 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.000
 destroy this opponent or want 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.940
 just the base 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.940
 then the pain of us left four three two 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.119
 remember the threat like u 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.670
 very much with the management ie we can here 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.920
 so now rotate our tank by yourself like this 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 can rotate the camera run delete 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.670
 that's how we can shoot we can also 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.289
 aim and shoot from various 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.390
 types of weapons above the map is shown here 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.550
 give good as he beat me 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.430
 ride here are our allies not together to 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.690
 will destroy the graphic enough 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.459
 pretty done here I repeat 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.739
 that it is very similar to releases by 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.230
 at least they would have a friend you say 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.940
 he won the tank here is their first enemy 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.910
 try it like this so let's 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.090
 swore to destroy together so to speak 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.610
 every tank or gun before 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.790
 allow from one amount of time 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.190
 recharges so of course you are in a row 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.560
 you became unable to make enemies 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.510
 all of them more and more by the way here 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.329
 they these plants will have to eat a single tank 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.860
 unfortunately not worthy worthy 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.840
 Well done game developers have already shot down 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.730
 make this game interesting is that here 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.680
 will not be transferred 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.239
 can release it on the android 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.730
 liked it here is a good alternative think 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:20.930
 very very game in like so let's 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.060

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.070

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.920

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.630
 repel I see nothing titan image 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.040
 refusal personally we picked wars kid on 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.620
 the map shows the location 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.230
 enemy tanks if they start 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.810
 I understand shoot here is the master of life 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.150

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.480

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.590
 here here and wars kid who we are 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.840

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.560
 just so here we will fight shoot 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.520

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.780
