hi<00:00:03.010> i'm<00:00:03.250> rob<00:00:03.460> from<00:00:03.489> mix<00:00:03.850> gage<00:00:04.090> in<00:00:04.689> this<00:00:04.899> video

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.230 
hi i'm rob from mix gage in this video

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.870 
hi i'm rob from mix gage in this video
we're<00:00:05.439> going<00:00:05.590> to<00:00:05.740> take<00:00:05.890> a<00:00:05.920> look<00:00:06.130> at<00:00:06.279> Wiesenfeld

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
we're going to take a look at Wiesenfeld

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.150 
we're going to take a look at Wiesenfeld
snow<00:00:07.210> socks<00:00:07.510> and<00:00:08.320> we're<00:00:08.440> also<00:00:08.590> going<00:00:08.889> to<00:00:08.980> try

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
snow socks and we're also going to try

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.680 
snow socks and we're also going to try
and<00:00:09.280> answer<00:00:09.400> some<00:00:09.640> of<00:00:09.940> the<00:00:10.030> more<00:00:10.180> frequently

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
and answer some of the more frequently

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.350 
and answer some of the more frequently
asked<00:00:10.900> questions<00:00:11.320> we<00:00:11.470> get<00:00:11.590> about<00:00:11.650> snow<00:00:12.070> sucks

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
asked questions we get about snow sucks

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.439 
asked questions we get about snow sucks
so<00:00:13.360> firstly<00:00:13.660> what<00:00:14.230> are<00:00:14.440> snow<00:00:14.740> sucks<00:00:15.449> snow

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
so firstly what are snow sucks snow

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.510 
so firstly what are snow sucks snow
socks<00:00:16.750> are<00:00:17.019> super<00:00:17.500> strong<00:00:17.680> textile<00:00:18.190> socks

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
socks are super strong textile socks

they're very simple to face and remove
and<00:00:32.020> unless<00:00:32.829> applied<00:00:33.100> as<00:00:33.219> a<00:00:33.250> pair<00:00:35.129> so<00:00:36.129> how<00:00:36.249> do

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
and unless applied as a pair so how do

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.319 
and unless applied as a pair so how do
they<00:00:36.550> work

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
they work

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.119

we've<00:00:56.339> tested<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:56.970> snow<00:00:57.210> sixes

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
we've tested these snow sixes

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
we've tested these snow sixes
extensively<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> makes<00:00:58.920> courage<00:00:59.250> over

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
extensively here it makes courage over

of<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:07.159> we<00:01:08.159> found<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.820> levels<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.509> grip<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
of time we found the levels of grip to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.410 
of time we found the levels of grip to
be<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.190> impressive<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.850> how

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
be to be really really impressive so how

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.700 
be to be really really impressive so how
do<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.690> fit

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
do they fit

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.980 
do they fit

top<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.960> tire<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.280> pull<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.670> snow

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
top of the tire you then pull the snow

top of the tire you then pull the snow
sock<00:01:28.150> down<00:01:28.300> over<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.750> tire<00:01:28.930> as<00:01:29.260> far<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:29.650> it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
sock down over the tire as far as it

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.770 
sock down over the tire as far as it
will<00:01:29.890> go<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.820> roll<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.330> car<00:01:31.510> backwards

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
will go then roll the car backwards

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.230 
will go then roll the car backwards
about<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.440> meter<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.070> pour<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.760> rest<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.150> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
about a meter and pour the rest of the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.360 
about a meter and pour the rest of the
sock<00:01:34.420> up<00:01:34.690> over<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.380> top<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.800> tire

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.040 

the<00:01:39.370> snow<00:01:39.610> sock<00:01:39.850> will<00:01:40.060> center<00:01:40.479> itself<00:01:40.720> very

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
the snow sock will center itself very

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.580 
the snow sock will center itself very
quickly<00:01:41.260> after<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.950> few<00:01:42.130> hundred<00:01:42.220> meters

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
quickly after just a few hundred meters

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.760 
quickly after just a few hundred meters
so<00:01:44.590> when<00:01:44.740> should<00:01:44.950> snow<00:01:45.190> socks<00:01:45.490> be<00:01:45.729> used<00:01:46.770> snow

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
so when should snow socks be used snow

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.350 
so when should snow socks be used snow
socks<00:01:48.040> are<00:01:48.190> an<00:01:48.250> ideal<00:01:48.550> product<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.060> keep<00:01:49.210> in
