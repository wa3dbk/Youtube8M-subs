00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just because they're $15 ties they don't

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
just because they're $15 ties they don't
make<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.299> polyester<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.200> cheap<00:01:37.619> fabric

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
make in polyester or some cheap fabric

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.020 
make in polyester or some cheap fabric
like<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:38.880> still<00:01:39.150> silk<00:01:39.509> ties

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
like that they actually still silk ties

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
like that they actually still silk ties
overall<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:42.840> afar<00:01:43.020> yeah

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
overall if you see them from afar yeah

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.609 
overall if you see them from afar yeah
you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.280> fool<00:01:44.490> somebody<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:46.110> make<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.409> think

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you can fool somebody to make them think

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
you can fool somebody to make them think
that<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.829> actually<00:01:46.979> grenadine<00:01:47.610> ties<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that I actually grenadine ties and I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.030 
that I actually grenadine ties and I
actually<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> texture<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> know

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
actually like the texture of it you know

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.560 
actually like the texture of it you know
it's<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:51.090> than<00:01:51.180> from<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's a little different than from that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's a little different than from that
shiny<00:01:52.020> silk<00:01:52.439> tie<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.460> everybody's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
shiny silk tie that you know everybody's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
shiny silk tie that you know everybody's
not<00:01:53.939> aware<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.540> those<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.500> things<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
not aware so those are two things that I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.459 
not aware so those are two things that I
do<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.159> about<00:01:56.369> them<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.840> other<00:01:58.079> hand<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
do like about them on the other hand is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.639 
do like about them on the other hand is
if<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> close-up<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.380> tell

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
if if you see it close-up you can tell

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.050 
if if you see it close-up you can tell
that<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:01.979> actually<00:02:02.310> grenadine

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that it's not actually grenadine

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.639 
that it's not actually grenadine
obviously<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.049> faux<00:02:04.439> granite

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
obviously because it's a faux granite

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.459 
obviously because it's a faux granite
Dean<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.909> cheap<00:02:06.630> time<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.229> feel

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
Dean and it is a cheap time you can feel

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.469 
Dean and it is a cheap time you can feel
the<00:02:07.680> cheapness<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> time<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the cheapness of the time but like I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
the cheapness of the time but like I
said<00:02:09.660> once<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.410> doesn't<00:02:10.920> look<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.069> bad

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
said once on it doesn't look that bad

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
said once on it doesn't look that bad
and<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.120> texture<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.720> adds<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.230> little

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and the texture actually adds a little

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.520 
and the texture actually adds a little
bit

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
bit

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
bit
dimension<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.459> different<00:02:14.760> type<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:14.970> style

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
dimension and a different type of style

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110 
dimension and a different type of style
to<00:02:15.990> your<00:02:16.140> look<00:02:16.380> now<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.370> overall<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.970> not

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
to your look now that I overall it's not

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.910 
to your look now that I overall it's not
as<00:02:18.240> meaty<00:02:18.540> as<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.080> expect<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.620> from<00:02:19.800> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
as meaty as you can expect like from a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.770 
as meaty as you can expect like from a
high-end<00:02:20.280> Cantona<00:02:20.640> Napoli<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> seven

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
high-end Cantona Napoli like the seven

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.350 
high-end Cantona Napoli like the seven
folds<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.670> obviously<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
folds that I have it's obviously a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.390 
folds that I have it's obviously a
little<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.930> thinner<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.319> flimsier<00:02:25.980> little

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
little bit thinner and flimsier little

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.370 
little bit thinner and flimsier little
harder<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.790> tie<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.270> their<00:02:27.690> end<00:02:27.870> result<00:02:28.230> of

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
harder to tie and their end result of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.140 
harder to tie and their end result of
the<00:02:28.500> knot<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.400> smaller<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.000> can

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the knot is a little smaller as you can

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.080 
the knot is a little smaller as you can
see<00:02:30.330> right<00:02:30.510> now<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:31.319> overall<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.100> $15<00:02:32.970> I

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
see right now but overall for $15 I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
see right now but overall for $15 I
think<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.510> pretty<00:02:34.080> good<00:02:34.290> investment<00:02:34.440> if

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
think it's a pretty good investment if

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.470 
think it's a pretty good investment if
you<00:02:35.069> guys<00:02:35.190> want<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.459> change<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.880> your<00:02:36.000> tie<00:02:36.239> game
