so you won't stick out this is the how
the<00:01:10.950> hair<00:01:11.310> look<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> pot<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:14.090> I

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.180 

when<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.000> using<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.600> hair<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
when you are using this hair you have to

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.460 
when you are using this hair you have to
make<00:01:26.370> sure<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.970> take<00:01:27.240> small<00:01:27.810> pieces

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
make sure that you take small pieces

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.719 
make sure that you take small pieces
only<00:01:29.300> I'm<00:01:30.300> using<00:01:30.630> two<00:01:30.990> packs<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:32.190> pack<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
only I'm using two packs one pack in the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.270 
only I'm using two packs one pack in the
back<00:01:32.760> in<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.390> pack<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.810> front<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.070> back

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
back in one pack up front and the back

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.270 
back in one pack up front and the back
for<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.180> divided<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.229> two<00:01:37.440> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
for the back I divided it into two so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
for the back I divided it into two so
both<00:01:39.000> sides<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> back<00:01:40.050> can<00:01:40.290> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
both sides in the back can be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.749 
both sides in the back can be
proportional<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.500> half<00:01:46.800> is<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.520> one

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
proportional the first half is for one

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.070 
proportional the first half is for one
quarter<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:49.080> use<00:01:49.290> small<00:01:50.100> piece<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.930> is

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
quarter and I use small piece this is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.440 
quarter and I use small piece this is
basically<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.830> crochet<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:58.369> do<00:01:59.369> for<00:02:00.119> not

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
basically how I crochet I do for not

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410 
basically how I crochet I do for not
just<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:01.740> sure<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> hair<00:02:02.789> will<00:02:03.119> not

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just to make sure that the hair will not

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:14.720 
just to make sure that the hair will not
shed<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:13.019> also<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.920> reason<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.550> small

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
shed and also the reason I use small

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.990 
shed and also the reason I use small
pieces<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.220> sure<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.519> all<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
corners will be covered even though I

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.090 
corners will be covered even though I
don't<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> lot<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.630> hair<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.769> full

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100
