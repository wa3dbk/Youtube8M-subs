here is just winging it on speeds and
fees<00:00:58.070> I'm<00:00:58.339> not<00:00:58.659> optimizing<00:00:59.659> those<00:00:59.839> but<00:01:00.500> the

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
fees I'm not optimizing those but the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.880 
fees I'm not optimizing those but the
chip<00:01:00.799> load<00:01:00.979> is<00:01:01.159> about<00:01:01.400> three<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.820> half<00:01:02.890> mile

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
chip load is about three and a half mile

alright<00:05:45.379> here's<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.740> part<00:05:46.039> we<00:05:47.020> ran<00:05:48.020> over<00:05:48.349> the

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
alright here's the part we ran over the

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.629 
alright here's the part we ran over the
face<00:05:50.150> of<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.449> with<00:05:50.599> that<00:05:50.750> 1116<00:05:51.740> 10<00:05:51.949> mil<00:05:52.159> that

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
face of it with that 1116 10 mil that

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.670 
face of it with that 1116 10 mil that
end<00:05:52.879> mil<00:05:53.060> is<00:05:53.180> very<00:05:53.360> old<00:05:53.689> and<00:05:53.930> it<00:05:54.110> must<00:05:54.469> have<00:05:54.560> a

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
end mil is very old and it must have a

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.379 
end mil is very old and it must have a
burr<00:05:55.009> somewhere<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.580> actually<00:05:55.789> think<00:05:56.090> it<00:05:56.240> was

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
burr somewhere I actually think it was

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.679 
burr somewhere I actually think it was
resharpen<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.680> not<00:05:58.520> a<00:05:58.550> great<00:05:58.819> surface<00:05:59.360> finish

00:05:59.679 --> 00:05:59.689 
resharpen so not a great surface finish

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.890 
resharpen so not a great surface finish
as<00:05:59.870> you<00:05:59.900> can<00:06:00.139> see<00:06:00.379> but<00:06:01.340> what<00:06:01.669> we'll<00:06:01.879> do<00:06:02.120> is<00:06:02.479> when

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
as you can see but what we'll do is when

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.240 
as you can see but what we'll do is when
the<00:06:03.080> noob<00:06:03.259> inserts<00:06:03.620> come<00:06:03.860> from<00:06:04.009> the<00:06:04.099> face

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
the noob inserts come from the face

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.309 
the noob inserts come from the face
smell<00:06:04.520> in<00:06:04.699> a<00:06:04.759> couple<00:06:04.969> of<00:06:05.000> days<00:06:05.180> we'll<00:06:06.050> run<00:06:06.229> the

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
smell in a couple of days we'll run the

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.749 
smell in a couple of days we'll run the
face<00:06:06.469> going<00:06:06.740> across<00:06:06.889> it<00:06:07.219> and<00:06:07.370> see<00:06:07.490> how<00:06:07.639> that
