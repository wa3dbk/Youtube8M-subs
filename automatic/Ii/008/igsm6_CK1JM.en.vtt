00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
thing that was interesting was the setup

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.570 
thing that was interesting was the setup
they<00:01:15.960> were<00:01:16.020> running<00:01:16.259> which<00:01:16.590> she<00:01:17.189> went<00:01:17.340> beyond

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
they were running which she went beyond

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.219 
they were running which she went beyond
the<00:01:17.670> recommendations<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.479> thoroughly<00:01:18.780> in

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the recommendations of thoroughly in

the recommendations of thoroughly in

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
terms of canvas settings and that put

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
terms of canvas settings and that put
extra<00:01:23.159> pressure<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.850> tires<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.570> they

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
extra pressure on the tires and they

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.590 
extra pressure on the tires and they

actually been nearly considered starting

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420 
actually been nearly considered starting
from<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> pit<00:01:28.200> lane<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:29.369> were

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
from the pit lane because they were

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
from the pit lane because they were
concerned<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.600> extra<00:01:30.840> pressure<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.259> the

concerned that the extra pressure on the
tires<00:01:31.939> could<00:01:32.939> result<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.450> some<00:01:33.689> kind<00:01:33.900> of

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
tires could result in some kind of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
tires could result in some kind of
failure<00:01:35.270> as<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> turned<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.810> didn't

saturday unfortunately on sunday things
didn't<00:03:15.129> go<00:03:15.250> quite<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.519> well<00:03:15.700> when<00:03:16.000> he<00:03:16.090> crashed

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
didn't go quite so well when he crashed

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.449 
didn't go quite so well when he crashed
in<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.690> first<00:03:17.019> corner<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.799> lost<00:03:18.069> his<00:03:18.220> front

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.420 
wing and took out jaime alguersuari now
I<00:03:20.799> think<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.280> was<00:03:21.400> down<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:23.430> heavy

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
I think that was down to and the heavy

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.559 
I think that was down to and the heavy
fuel<00:03:24.669> though<00:03:24.790> they<00:03:24.910> have<00:03:25.030> at<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.239> start<00:03:25.480> of

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
fuel though they have at the start of

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.569 
fuel though they have at the start of
the<00:03:25.660> race<00:03:25.810> he<00:03:26.470> misjudged<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.040> breaking<00:03:27.400> point

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
the race he misjudged the breaking point

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.000 
the race he misjudged the breaking point
and<00:03:27.870> went<00:03:28.870> into<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.199> side<00:03:29.379> of<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.590> Toro<00:03:29.799> Rosso

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
and went into the side of the Toro Rosso

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.710 
and went into the side of the Toro Rosso
it<00:03:30.430> was<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.639> real<00:03:30.849> shame<00:03:31.060> because<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.449> think<00:03:31.510> we

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
it was a real shame because I think we

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.659 
it was a real shame because I think we
could<00:03:31.840> have<00:03:31.870> seen<00:03:32.169> have<00:03:32.949> you<00:03:33.190> been<00:03:33.459> able<00:03:33.519> to

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
could have seen have you been able to

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.920 
could have seen have you been able to
live<00:03:33.790> up<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:34.000> his<00:03:34.060> qualifying<00:03:34.389> points<00:03:34.720> but<00:03:34.840> it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
live up to his qualifying points but it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.059 
live up to his qualifying points but it
would<00:03:35.019> have<00:03:35.109> seen<00:03:35.260> kind<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.620> really<00:03:35.829> what<00:03:35.980> he

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
would have seen kind of really what he

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.979 
would have seen kind of really what he
was<00:03:36.190> made<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.669> we'll<00:03:37.389> have<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.629> wait<00:03:37.780> until

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
was made of and we'll have to wait until

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.890 
was made of and we'll have to wait until
until<00:03:38.859> Monza<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.400> see<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.449> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
until Monza to see that but and the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.599 
until Monza to see that but and the
early<00:03:41.139> signs<00:03:41.319> are<00:03:41.470> very<00:03:41.650> good<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.010> we<00:03:42.430> must

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
early signs are very good and we must

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:43.949 
early signs are very good and we must
remember<00:03:42.730> he's<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> very<00:03:43.239> good<00:03:43.359> driver<00:03:43.540> came

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
remember he's a very good driver came

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.500 
remember he's a very good driver came
second<00:03:44.379> in<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.709> gp2<00:03:45.040> championship<00:03:45.730> in<00:03:45.879> 2008

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
second in the gp2 championship in 2008

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.869 
second in the gp2 championship in 2008
to<00:03:46.720> Giorgio<00:03:47.470> pants<00:03:47.769> know<00:03:47.919> who<00:03:48.069> himself<00:03:48.220> was<00:03:48.730> a

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
to Giorgio pants know who himself was a

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.110 
to Giorgio pants know who himself was a
good<00:03:49.090> try<00:03:49.299> burn<00:03:49.510> probably<00:03:50.049> underrated<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:50.620> f1

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
good try burn probably underrated in f1

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.550 
good try burn probably underrated in f1
so<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.419> think<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.930> future<00:03:53.139> is<00:03:53.260> looking<00:03:53.379> very

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
so I think the future is looking very

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.259 
so I think the future is looking very
bright<00:03:53.829> for<00:03:54.129> him<00:03:54.250> as<00:03:54.579> long<00:03:54.609> as<00:03:54.730> he<00:03:54.819> can<00:03:54.970> hold<00:03:55.120> on

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
bright for him as long as he can hold on

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.080 
bright for him as long as he can hold on
to<00:03:55.720> his<00:03:55.840> seat<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.489> legal<00:03:57.819> action

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
to his seat and that this legal action

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.479 
to his seat and that this legal action
with<00:03:58.269> Heidfeld<00:03:58.720> doesn't<00:03:59.590> swap<00:03:59.889> swap<00:04:00.340> that

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
with Heidfeld doesn't swap swap that

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.610 
with Heidfeld doesn't swap swap that
back<00:04:00.639> over<00:04:00.790> but<00:04:01.150> at<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.540> moment<00:04:01.659> it<00:04:02.019> looks<00:04:02.349> at

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
back over but at the moment it looks at

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.599 
back over but at the moment it looks at
it<00:04:02.769> looks<00:04:02.919> like<00:04:03.040> he's<00:04:03.159> going<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.370> be<00:04:03.430> there<00:04:03.459> for

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
it looks like he's going to be there for

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.670 
it looks like he's going to be there for
the<00:04:03.730> rest<00:04:03.849> of<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> season<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.599> it's<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:05.560> it's

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
the rest of the season and it's so it's

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.520 
the rest of the season and it's so it's
going<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.829> be<00:04:05.889> doing<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.280> good<00:04:07.030> job<00:04:07.090> there<00:04:07.530> we

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
going to be doing a good job there we

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.439 
going to be doing a good job there we
certainly<00:04:08.859> saw<00:04:09.040> plenty<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.519> overtaking<00:04:10.090> its

DRS<00:04:13.419> make<00:04:14.199> it<00:04:14.379> too<00:04:14.590> easy<00:04:15.840> well<00:04:16.840> some<00:04:17.049> people

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
DRS make it too easy well some people

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.589 
DRS make it too easy well some people
love<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.620> DRS<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.280> some<00:04:18.549> people<00:04:18.820> hate<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.150> ATS

love the DRS and some people hate it ATS

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.080 
love the DRS and some people hate it ATS
pirate<00:04:20.139> certainly<00:04:20.530> made<00:04:20.739> overtaking<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.789> lot

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
pirate certainly made overtaking a lot

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.149 
pirate certainly made overtaking a lot
easier<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.659> a<00:04:23.380> lot<00:04:23.469> of<00:04:23.530> time<00:04:23.740> we<00:04:23.860> saw<00:04:24.039> an

easier and a lot of time we saw an

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.550 
easier and a lot of time we saw an

the<00:04:26.830> braking<00:04:27.190> zone

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
the braking zone

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.920 
the braking zone
and<00:04:27.940> in<00:04:28.090> my<00:04:28.210> opinion<00:04:28.330> that's<00:04:28.660> not

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
and in my opinion that's not

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.410 
and in my opinion that's not

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
particularly exciting to watch okay you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.900 
particularly exciting to watch okay you
get<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> change<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.230> position<00:04:32.440> which<00:04:32.920> we've

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
get the change in position which we've

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.400 
get the change in position which we've
been<00:04:34.120> lacking<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.600> formal<00:04:34.900> one<00:04:34.990> in<00:04:35.110> recent

been lacking in formal one in recent

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.310 
been lacking in formal one in recent
years<00:04:35.440> but<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:37.060> know<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.810> best<00:04:37.990> thing<00:04:38.110> about

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
years but you know the best thing about

former one is watching cars defend as

well as attack and I don't think there

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.560 
well as attack and I don't think there
was<00:04:42.130> much<00:04:42.190> or<00:04:42.520> choose<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.850> defend<00:04:43.090> against<00:04:43.450> the

lending process the FI I've always said

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
that about the DRS you know there'll be

that about the DRS you know there'll be

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
occasions when it works incredibly well

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.970 
occasions when it works incredibly well
there'll<00:04:53.050> be<00:04:53.080> occasions<00:04:53.500> when<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.770> hardly

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
there'll be occasions when it hardly

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.370 
there'll be occasions when it hardly
works<00:04:54.100> at<00:04:54.310> all<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:55.180> it's<00:04:55.630> understanding<00:04:56.200> that

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
works at all so it's understanding that

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.350 
works at all so it's understanding that
and<00:04:56.620> learning<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.460> going<00:04:57.640> for<00:04:57.820> next<00:04:58.030> year<00:04:58.180> so

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
and learning and going for next year so

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.880 
and learning and going for next year so
I<00:04:58.390> mean<00:04:58.570> hopefully<00:04:58.750> next<00:04:59.110> year<00:04:59.230> at<00:04:59.410> spar<00:04:59.680> we'll

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
I mean hopefully next year at spar we'll

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.130 
I mean hopefully next year at spar we'll
see<00:05:00.040> maybe<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.340> shorter<00:05:00.730> DRS<00:05:01.120> zone<00:05:01.330> or<00:05:01.870> may<00:05:02.080> be

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
see maybe a shorter DRS zone or may be

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.700 
see maybe a shorter DRS zone or may be
placed<00:05:02.500> somewhere<00:05:03.070> else<00:05:03.340> in<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> circuit<00:05:03.970> IV

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
placed somewhere else in the circuit IV

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.000 
placed somewhere else in the circuit IV
would<00:05:05.710> help<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.910> know<00:05:07.030> would<00:05:07.540> actually

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
would help and you know would actually

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.500 
would help and you know would actually
result<00:05:09.010> in<00:05:09.280> better<00:05:09.400> if<00:05:09.670> I<00:05:09.880> don't<00:05:10.090> think<00:05:10.330> you

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
result in better if I don't think you

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.180 
result in better if I don't think you
really<00:05:10.690> need<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.470> position<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.860> wasn't

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
really need it in the position it wasn't

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.640 
really need it in the position it wasn't
spa<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.360> Monza<00:05:13.720> is<00:05:13.750> going<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.020> be<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.200> DRS

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
spa and the Monza is going to be to DRS

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.020 
spa and the Monza is going to be to DRS
zones<00:05:14.890> which<00:05:15.100> should<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.370> interesting<00:05:15.760> to<00:05:15.850> see

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
zones which should be interesting to see

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.430 
zones which should be interesting to see
although<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.360> DRS<00:05:16.900> won't<00:05:17.110> be<00:05:17.200> as<00:05:17.260> powerful

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
although the DRS won't be as powerful

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.470 
although the DRS won't be as powerful
because<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.460> cars<00:05:18.670> will<00:05:18.850> be<00:05:18.970> running<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.330> lot

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
because the cars will be running a lot

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.840 
because the cars will be running a lot
less<00:05:19.720> downforce<00:05:20.080> overall<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.370> we<00:05:21.460> let's

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
less downforce overall so that we let's

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.330 
less downforce overall so that we let's
to<00:05:22.030> shed<00:05:22.270> when<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.840> when<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.560> wing<00:05:23.770> opens<00:05:24.160> up

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
to shed when the when the wing opens up

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.180 
to shed when the when the wing opens up
which<00:05:24.910> is<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.270> how<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:25.810> works<00:05:26.050> so<00:05:26.560> I<00:05:27.070> think

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
which is that how it works so I think

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.470 
which is that how it works so I think
it's<00:05:27.340> going<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.520> make<00:05:27.640> for<00:05:27.700> exciting<00:05:27.880> written

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
it's going to make for exciting written

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.330 
it's going to make for exciting written
ones<00:05:28.660> because<00:05:28.930> Monza<00:05:29.320> in<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.920> past<00:05:30.100> years

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
ones because Monza in the past years

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.920 
ones because Monza in the past years
actually<00:05:30.550> quite<00:05:30.850> difficult<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.360> overtake<00:05:31.750> her

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
actually quite difficult to overtake her

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.830 
actually quite difficult to overtake her
and<00:05:32.110> I<00:05:33.100> think<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.520> should<00:05:33.730> add<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.570> spice

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
and I think it should add the spice

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.280 
and I think it should add the spice
there<00:05:35.170> that<00:05:35.800> is<00:05:35.920> needed<00:05:36.100> for<00:05:36.960> foot<00:05:37.960> for<00:05:38.110> great

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
there that is needed for foot for great

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.870 
there that is needed for foot for great
