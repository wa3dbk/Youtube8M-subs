00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.549
 hello and welcome to this part of the 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.219
 colony continue with the post 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:17.840
 partitioned of 1,204 hernÃ¡ndez that 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.849
 we have finished with the part with the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.090
 partitioning of the disk we are going to 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.130
 start with the system configuration 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.060
 The first thing he asks is our 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.220
 location in the case I think it comes out 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.800
 by default it is from this leaves Spain 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.910
 that is where I find the way that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.910
 I will give you to continue 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:47.740
 the cases and from Latin America from another 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:52.050
 part of the country is the bull that came out 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.670
 this is the layout of the keyboard 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.379
 I will leave it as Spanish 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 Spanish but to check that it works 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.579
 we can press the we can try the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.949
 Spanish special keys 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.610
 here the interrogation opening the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.680
 opening 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.030
 it's passion 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.380
 the affects 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.909
 to start that everything is working 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.690
 in the right way so that if you 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.690
 We give to continue 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.450
 now he asks for our name 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.580
 the name of the team that you can put 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.400
 anything but you can not put 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.260
 rare characters spaces or nothing 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.970
 the username that does not have 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.570
 what is the same as your name is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.300
 say you can be fulanito pÃ©rez de 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.540
 and that you do not need to be the 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.900
 So, for example, let's stay a little 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.900
 expensive 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.020
 now the password here put the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 system of all your glasses will do 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.990
 a small consideration to see if 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
 your password is strong or in the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.870
 case of those interests pretty 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.870
 loose 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.010
 and password to live 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.930
 we have to repeat it 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.280
 the ones that I've put well and now 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.040
 we have here several others that are 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.750
 interest is automatically a system 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.530
 We will ask password or anything 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.709
 directly with this user 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.780
 or asking for the password seems to be 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.900
 that is, to choose the radar 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.900
 choose user click we want the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.459
 session and we will have to put the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.069
 password of our user the one 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.780
 we just wrote here and finally 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.770
 we have an option that is to encrypt our 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.090
 personal folder in which if we have 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.010
 things we do not want others to see 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.520
 lost posts a password for 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.650
 be able to access that 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.640
 physical 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.140
 I do not have to do it, I'm not going to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.019
 encrypt you can do what 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.210
 it deems fit here 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.710
 discover I'm not going to deny it 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.540
 so I said this is 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.540
 we simply give you to continue 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.860
 and now there's nothing left to wait for 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.140
 finish the installation if I predict and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.700
 so much I could surf the internet and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.340
 others because remember because this is a 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.459
 LCD and so we chose to try a 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.629
 install and not install now because you 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.940
 we give this grenade but also 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.980
 we could invite the charger and have a 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.579
 live normal cd but it's a little bit more 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.290
 rollete that comes directly to us as 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.730
 in this case 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.560
 Well, once the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.329
 installation process we believe that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.829
 rosebushes message that tells us the 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.540
 set finished can continue 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.340
 try tribute now but that three for 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.050
 the team any change it makes or 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.170
 document they keep will not be preserved 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.830
 this is what we wanted in the air so 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.120
 that we can keep trying lcd or what 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.880
 I recommend and recommend the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.880
 system is to restart now clicks 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.970
 ah 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.490
 and now what appears here 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.730
 what comes to say in the language of 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.139
 cervantes that if you give up on 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.169
 installation or oil whatever 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.590
 So let's take it out and once done 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.590
 let's press 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:34.330
 and now we have to give to our 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.880
 google with the generic 3.2 card of 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.050
 tooth recovery he has here 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.850
 several options and then the windows 7 that 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.920
 we can start without any kind of 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.450
 problem 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.450
 We can test the use if we want 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.160
 and let's see how it starts without any 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.160
 type of problem 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.110
 to 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.270
 since it does not ask you already 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.570
 our username and password seem 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.570
 houses 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.980
 and start the session perfectly as 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.910
 you can check right now 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:19.110
 our fish if you have done everything 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.110
 here in the video 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.610
 one 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.169
 and the normal desktop 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.169
 windows also works 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.720
 restart 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.879
 and well now we can start windows 7 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:51.120
 without any problem here what 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.120
 you have 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.169
 and good as far manual 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.870
 installation completely from scratch 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:07.080
 satisfaced 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.450
 12 04 lts I hope you liked it 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.760
 I have been useful above all and as 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.060
 always if you have any doubt do not doubt 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.770
 worth the redundancy in leaving a 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.250
 comment below on the videos in 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.860
 the comments of the video sorry or 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.590
 you can go through the web of the body and 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:30.350
 there then those contact areas so 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:33.350
 without more I say goodbye and until another video 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.350
 bye
