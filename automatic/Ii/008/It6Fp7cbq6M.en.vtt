00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 championship in paris 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.080
 [Music] 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:32.100
 [Music] 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.100
 Hello 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:41.369
 [Music] 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.300
 to have 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:01:02.599
 [Music] 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.720
 [Music] 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.030
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.550
 they saw her wanting it 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 triple toe-loop jump and you 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.110
 jumped only twice 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.360
 That's a difficult enough 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.080
 not from the double axel against it 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.080
 excellent 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.159
 [Applause] 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:53.060
 [Music] 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 the double beat 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.710
 very nice 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.069
 Yes 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:46.750
 [Music] 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.970
 yes she could get her performance from the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.450
 American championships do not 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.280
 repeat that was a very weak one 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.630
 Jump combination with the double toeloop 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.000
 double coup 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.790
 there is already a triple jump 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.690
 necessary if you are world champion here 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.280
 wants to be 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:11.050
 we'll see each other again in the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:12.910
 slow motion she wanted three verspringen the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.130
 you can see clearly here so it was 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.590
 no tactical variant it would be too 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.270
 the rest of the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.830
 double axel of course impeccable though 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.010
 now it is in the competition 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:31.560
 of course, again interesting and 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.110
 exciting christa passÃ© is disappointed 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.380
 that looked like such a clear thing 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.459
 tears for Schild and now it is 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.459
 everything is open again 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.409
 yes I'm curious how the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.409
 respond to it 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.650
 sign race are the judges 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.389
 helpless 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.000
 long time you need yes 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.729
 count now there can not be a big one 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.860
 making mistakes now is juggling with 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:40.070
 the numbers which we can go 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.470
 yes, that's possible because it's her 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.800
 very well served with this rating 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.800
 was 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:56.470
 she can be very satisfied with that 56 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.470
 from hungary even 55 from the soviet union 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.160
 you have to imagine that 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.620
 dear spectator she is the only one 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.260
 runner, this was a double 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.360
 jump combination shown but the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.810
 evaluations for the artistic 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.540
 Impression are high and that could be for 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:34.060
 she still a very cheap one 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:34.060
 Constellation would be the next runner
