00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
that has an energy field not sure if

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.330 
that has an energy field not sure if
it's<00:00:55.750> magnetic<00:00:56.620> or<00:00:56.800> what-have-you

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
strings with that channel if you see

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.830 
strings with that channel if you see
that<00:01:47.020> channel<00:01:47.410> right<00:01:47.560> there<00:01:48.209> the<00:01:49.209> strings<00:01:49.569> can

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
that channel right there the strings can

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.139 
that channel right there the strings can
rest<00:01:50.110> on<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.619> side<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.550> string<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:51.970> want

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
rest on the side but the string you want

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.880 
rest on the side but the string you want
to<00:01:52.240> vibrate<00:01:52.630> needs<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:53.110> be<00:01:53.380> right<00:01:53.619> in<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
to vibrate needs to be right in the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.699 
to vibrate needs to be right in the
middle<00:01:54.130> here<00:01:54.569> right<00:01:55.569> down<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.410> middle<00:01:56.590> of

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
middle here right down the middle of

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.480 
middle here right down the middle of
that<00:01:56.860> channel<00:01:57.899> get<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.020> focus<00:01:59.229> working<00:01:59.740> okay

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
that channel get the focus working okay

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.309 
that channel get the focus working okay
so<00:02:00.819> if<00:02:01.149> you're<00:02:01.330> on<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.509> E<00:02:01.539> string<00:02:01.929> then<00:02:02.140> you're

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
so if you're on the E string then you're

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.010 
so if you're on the E string then you're
going<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.470> rest<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.860> B<00:02:03.039> string<00:02:03.429> right<00:02:03.610> here<00:02:04.090> if

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
going to rest the B string right here if

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.480 
going to rest the B string right here if
you're<00:02:05.140> doing<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.470> B<00:02:05.619> string<00:02:05.979> then<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.340> can

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
you're doing the B string then you can

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.160 
you're doing the B string then you can
rest<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.819> e<00:02:06.850> string<00:02:07.330> right<00:02:07.479> here<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.899> g

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
rest the e string right here in the g

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.330 
rest the e string right here in the g
string<00:02:08.500> right<00:02:08.649> there<00:02:08.709> okay<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.190> just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
string right there okay so you just

string right there okay so you just
bring<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:12.670> down<00:02:12.730> I'm<00:02:13.060> resting<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.780> B

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
bring this down I'm resting it on the B

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.339 
bring this down I'm resting it on the B
string<00:02:14.020> right<00:02:14.650> there<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.780> closer<00:02:17.080> you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
bring it to the string the more it's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.449 
bring it to the string the more it's
going<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.090> vibrate<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:20.319> we<00:02:20.440> start<00:02:20.709> here<00:02:20.770> on<00:02:20.980> 14

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
going to vibrate so we start here on 14

that<00:02:50.360> shimmer<00:02:54.500> hold<00:02:56.450> than<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:59.660> and<00:03:00.660> now<00:03:00.900> this

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
that shimmer hold than this and now this

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.080 
that shimmer hold than this and now this
will<00:03:02.040> stay<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.460> e-string<00:03:02.580> because<00:03:02.970> it's

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
will stay on the e-string because it's

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.400 
will stay on the e-string because it's
easier<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> e<00:03:03.660> bow<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> stay<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.200> one

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
easier with the e bow to stay on one

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:19.370 
easier with the e bow to stay on one
string<00:03:16.370> okay<00:03:17.370> now<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:18.060> bump<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.450> over<00:03:18.600> if

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
string okay now you can bump it over if

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.630 
string okay now you can bump it over if
you<00:03:19.590> want<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:19.800> go<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> B<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.460> it's<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
you want to go to the B but it's a

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:39.610 
you want to go to the B but it's a
little<00:03:20.790> tricky<00:03:21.210> you'd<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.170> do<00:03:22.290> this

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.449 

worked<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:40.740> well<00:03:41.069> actually<00:03:41.220> I've

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
worked out pretty well actually I've

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.830 
worked out pretty well actually I've
never<00:03:41.490> really<00:03:41.819> practiced<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.330> but<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.630> can

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
never really practiced that but you can

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.170 
never really practiced that but you can
do<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.650> practice<00:03:44.370> flipping

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
do it you just have to practice flipping

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.680 
do it you just have to practice flipping
this<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.740> real<00:03:46.740> quick<00:03:46.770> okay

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:01.390 

see<00:03:53.690> there<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:54.050> go<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:59.890> that's<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.070> Evo

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
see there you go and that's the Evo

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.080 
see there you go and that's the Evo
using<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:03.650> get<00:04:04.010> your<00:04:04.160> sustain<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.760> don't<00:04:04.910> need

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
using to get your sustain you don't need

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.300 
using to get your sustain you don't need
an<00:04:05.210> expensive<00:04:05.600> sustainer<00:04:09.100> one<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
an expensive sustainer one of the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.440 
an expensive sustainer one of the
reasons<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.700> reason<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.150> now<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.810> explain<00:04:13.450> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
reasons the reason I now to explain the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.210 
reasons the reason I now to explain the
reason<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.810> go<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.230> B<00:04:15.350> string<00:04:15.410> is<00:04:15.950> because

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
reason I go to the B string is because

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.410 
reason I go to the B string is because
okay<00:04:19.220> he<00:04:19.459> picks<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.970> couple<00:04:20.269> notes<00:04:20.390> here

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.090 

well<00:04:25.420> if<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.840> plan<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.170> b-string<00:04:26.350> guess<00:04:26.860> what

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
well if you plan the b-string guess what

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.890 
well if you plan the b-string guess what
when<00:04:27.550> their<00:04:27.700> main<00:04:27.820> riff<00:04:28.030> starts<00:04:28.180> you're<00:04:28.660> right

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
when their main riff starts you're right

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.200 
when their main riff starts you're right
there<00:04:29.230> in<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.380> hand<00:04:29.710> position<00:04:30.190> whereas<00:04:31.060> if

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
there in that hand position whereas if

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.090 
there in that hand position whereas if
you<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.570> this<00:04:31.840> version<00:04:32.320> if<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.710> do<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.920> on<00:04:32.980> the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
you do this version if you do it on the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.140 
you do this version if you do it on the
e-string

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.820 

then<00:04:41.150> you<00:04:41.270> need<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.449> move<00:04:41.690> when<00:04:42.410> we<00:04:42.530> go<00:04:42.650> into

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
then you need to move when we go into

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.100 
then you need to move when we go into
the<00:04:42.919> main<00:04:43.040> riff<00:04:43.389> you<00:04:44.389> got<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.600> move<00:04:44.750> your<00:04:44.810> hand

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
the main riff you got to move your hand

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.840 
the main riff you got to move your hand
back<00:04:45.320> down<00:04:45.350> here<00:04:46.540> for<00:04:47.540> that<00:04:47.660> part<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:49.310> don't

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
back down here for that part I don't

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.520 
back down here for that part I don't
like<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.210> do<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.750> find<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.410> more

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
like to do that I find it more

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.070 
like to do that I find it more
comfortable<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.040> stay<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.699> one<00:04:53.360> position<00:04:53.600> when

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
comfortable to stay in one position when

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.280 
comfortable to stay in one position when
possible<00:04:54.970> not<00:04:55.970> moving<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.479> less<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.080> move

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
possible not moving the less I move

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.820 
possible not moving the less I move
around<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.620> neck<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.130> easier<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.669> is<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:59.840> I

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
around the neck the easier it is so I

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.730 
around the neck the easier it is so I
end<00:05:01.550> up<00:05:01.699> going<00:05:01.940> to<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:02.479> 14th<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.260> B<00:05:03.470> and

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
end up going to this 14th on the B and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.500 
end up going to this 14th on the B and
the<00:05:05.139> 13s<00:05:06.139> q<00:05:06.410> fifteen<00:05:06.970> fourteen<00:05:07.970> fifteen

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
the 13s q fifteen fourteen fifteen

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.860 
the 13s q fifteen fourteen fifteen
twelve<00:05:12.190> okay<00:05:13.190> but<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.850> don't<00:05:14.389> think<00:05:14.479> edge<00:05:14.630> does

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
twelve okay but I don't think edge does

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.670 
twelve okay but I don't think edge does
that<00:05:15.080> I<00:05:15.260> turn<00:05:16.070> off<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.460> sustainer<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.680> then

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
that I turn off the sustainer and then

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.520 
that I turn off the sustainer and then
we<00:05:18.800> go<00:05:18.979> into<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.850> main<00:05:20.030> riff<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:21.380> main

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
we go into the main riff and the main

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.640 
we go into the main riff and the main
riff<00:05:21.770> is<00:05:22.340> really<00:05:22.669> straightforward<00:05:23.470> let's<00:05:24.470> go

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
riff is really straightforward let's go

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.160 
riff is really straightforward let's go
into<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:24.949> next
