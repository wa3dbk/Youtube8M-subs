00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.710
 I do not eat for a while 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.710

 Slowly but Marisa is Hello everybody slowly Reimu 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:47.350
 It's slow and it's slow . I'll continue to make interiors last time . It's triple speed. 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.159
 Take care of the screen sickness from 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.309
 Since the second floor is a cafeteria, I will set up a small chair and table 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.340
 This time it's vanilla furniture because it doesn't have a furniture mod 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.230
 Once in a while Some vanilla 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.920
 The second floor has been completed so I will make stairs to go to the attic 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.300
 Let's go 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.390
 It's too small for the counter, but there's only one place here. 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.390

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.729
 I will cover the roof after the stairs are completed. 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.880
 It is not appropriate I asked the design engineer properly 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.749
 Then I 'll call a design engineer and I will read a good franc 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.159
 What a design engineer you can't wait for a sunny char 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.680
 Would it not a design engineer I do not have license'll'm a design engineer 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.100
 It is good 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.470
 Please help me because it's hard to put on the roof 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.470
 It 's over as it is, is it over? 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.129
 It looks like a nice hidden room. 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.730
 was 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 Hmm 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.879
 I understood 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.940

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.940
 Not standing

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.240
 me 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.240
 It's kind of stupid but it's only me 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.170
 Pack field 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.170
 car 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.810
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.530
 I am 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.530
 Shooting 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:35.540
 So let's introduce that the attic was completed 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.200
 Proper introductions and interiors as you go up the stairs Narrow corridors, wheat rooms are for two people, and left rooms are for one person 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.090
 Is 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.640
 I tried to put a carpet on the floor and it looks like Sunrise Twin in the image. 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.580
 Even if you say that, I'm not sure 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.700
 One person is bc 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:52.440
 It is feeling that all the cars are in stock . The price is reasonable. 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:57.600
 One person is with meals for one night 6000 yen Two people are 10,000 yen for two people 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.790
 It's a little too cheap, I'm the only one and I don't have to pay it, so it's enough 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.569
 That's right-Doa Sato Damon 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:09.879
 It's a time to show off in that I'm a flower that cares more about the interior 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.049
 It secret to be I thought doing good anymore exterior is satisfied with best regards your wish and you interior 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.049
 Let's go there soon 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:30.180
 First of all, I tried to make it here from the front of the building 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.230
 The reason why I mass-produced the creeper girl after massing it is only open with a fence. 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.900
 It is to 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:41.529
 I want to make it bigger, so I feel like the sleepy villagers have been cured from zombies 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.819
 It's a line I've heard of welcome to the village under my control 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:50.319
 The doctor's association is a horse like this A horse is just a mixture 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:55.919
 'M stables, is not it prison'll there was a prison saw was Itteyuu comment 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.919
 It is no longer visible only in prison It is Ehime that the ceiling is low 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240
 Hmm 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.050
 Well then let's go to the second floor 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.969
 It's a stone staircase here, but it was fine with wood, but I wanted to match it with the wall so I made it with this 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:20.799
 Was 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.459
 I also say that the villagers here will come to the second floor but they will not enter the attic 

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:26.079
 right 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:29.960
 I don't have to pay for it, so I have to go there twice and this is the cafeteria 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:32.350
 The name of the shop is Starbucks coffee The shop I've heard somewhere 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.350
 s name 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:57.060
 Was doing so after chair and table was far to be your love and respect odd 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:59.550
 To make a reservation of accommodation at the counter there are different sky Bookshelf Iron Golem-chan in the attic from here 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.530
 I get a card key and go to the room 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:07.699
 By the way, are wondering is better wide'll not change the price but is for two people can be reserved even one person 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.699
 Have two for two 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.910
 I'm alone because I'm settled down 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:32.090
 It is an introduction suitable for a suitable architecture which ends the introduction with a feeling like 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.090
 It's not so good, so it's not good 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.990
 me 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.050
 Hmm 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.050
 me 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.249
 me 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.249
 Hmm 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.249
 Hmm 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.169
 Yes I changed the settings and the shadow mod became beautiful 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.169
 I guess 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:20.230
 It is short as usual, but this time to here 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:23.580
 It's a bit sloppy recently The next time it's a great video , I'm sorry for this time 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.580
 You're going to be slow again next time
