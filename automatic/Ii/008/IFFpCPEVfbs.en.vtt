1/2 a cup of yogurt into this now I will

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.240 
1/2 a cup of yogurt into this now I will
be<00:00:38.820> needing<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.329> water<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> smooth

with<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> water<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.570> let<00:00:45.750> me<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.320> water

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
with the water so let me take some water

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
with the water so let me take some water
again<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.629> whole<00:00:49.050> bowl<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.219> water<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.590> just

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
again this whole bowl of water and just

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.119 
again this whole bowl of water and just
pour<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.190> bit<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.210> try<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.100> make<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
pour in a little bit and try to make a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
pour in a little bit and try to make a
smooth<00:00:56.640> batter<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.050> proper

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
smooth batter out of it a proper

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.959 
smooth batter out of it a proper
consistency<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.820> will<00:01:00.120> show<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:01.489> just<00:01:02.489> keep<00:01:02.789> an

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
consistency I will show you just keep an

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.149 
consistency I will show you just keep an
eye<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> water<00:01:05.119> till<00:01:06.119> your

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
eye on a little bit of water till your

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.539 
eye on a little bit of water till your
paste<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.610> schools<00:01:09.240> around<00:01:10.340> starting<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
paste is schools around starting it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
paste is schools around starting it
there<00:01:11.909> should<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.119> no<00:01:12.540> lumps<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.320> batter

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there should be no lumps in your batter

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.410 
there should be no lumps in your batter
and<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.580> should<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> lump<00:01:15.330> free<00:01:15.659> smooth<00:01:16.560> back

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.590 

I<00:01:23.830> have<00:01:24.830> added<00:01:25.100> Kurt<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.940> ferment<00:01:26.390> this

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
I have added Kurt to ferment this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.719 
I have added Kurt to ferment this
mixture<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.590> will<00:01:28.130> leave<00:01:28.490> this

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
mixture and now I will leave this

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.290 
mixture and now I will leave this
mixture<00:01:29.150> for<00:01:29.770> around<00:01:30.770> two<00:01:31.070> three<00:01:31.460> hours<00:01:31.820> if

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
mixture for around two three hours if

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.990 
mixture for around two three hours if
you<00:01:32.570> want<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.900> make<00:01:33.140> more<00:01:34.010> software<00:01:34.550> at<00:01:34.760> least

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
you want to make more software at least

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.840 
you want to make more software at least
one<00:01:35.810> suggestion<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.500> leave<00:01:37.160> this<00:01:37.490> mixture

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
one suggestion is leave this mixture

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.960 
one suggestion is leave this mixture
overnight<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.080> make<00:01:39.830> your<00:01:40.070> release<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.759> next

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
overnight and make your release the next

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.670 
overnight and make your release the next
very<00:01:41.240> day<00:01:41.420> but<00:01:41.660> this<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:41.990> instant<00:01:42.380> way<00:01:42.530> of

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
very day but this is the instant way of

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.160 
very day but this is the instant way of
making<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.340> mixture<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.509> we're<00:01:44.750> adding<00:01:44.869> some

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
making it mixture and we're adding some

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.859 
making it mixture and we're adding some
more<00:01:45.380> water<00:01:47.320> rava<00:01:48.320> or<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.710> cg<00:01:49.420> absorbs<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.630> lot

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
more water rava or the cg absorbs a lot

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.740 
more water rava or the cg absorbs a lot
of<00:01:51.110> water<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.640> batter<00:01:52.850> has<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.420> be<00:01:53.539> little

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
of water so the batter has to be little

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.830 
of water so the batter has to be little
little<00:01:54.200> running<00:01:54.649> not<00:01:54.920> much<00:01:55.450> because<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.630> will

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
little running not much because it will

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.680 
little running not much because it will
then<00:01:57.170> after<00:01:57.680> some<00:01:57.950> hours<00:01:58.100> come<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.940> its<00:01:59.149> proper

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
then after some hours come to its proper

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.110 
then after some hours come to its proper
consistency
