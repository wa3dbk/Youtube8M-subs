00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello together today I'll show you two 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 super nice light and very simple 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.389
 make up this would be the first thing I did 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.610
 Also great for make-up beginners 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.740
 and after we did that show 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.990
 I like you that in this left 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.160
 You can transform make-up and that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.750
 is perhaps more suitable for 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.070
 advanced and if you know 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.880
 I want to do it as I did 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.380
 plan because it's going on a lot of fun 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.660
 As for any make-up I would like you 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.670
 Always guess your face before beautiful 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.740
 to supply much moisture with it 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.540
 ready for the make up for example 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.180
 in the form of a day cream or a 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.130
 Moisturizer because this is one 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.860
 very light and really simple 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.079
 I will take care of my make-up here 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.660
 just my concealer and wear the under 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.210
 my eyes on quietly route dark circles 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.060
 have and a side to my nose because 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.070
 I'll be fine there soon, too 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.310
 I associate it all with mine 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.140
 Ring finger because then the gentlest 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.810
 fingers that can be used on the skin 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.649
 and tapulous afterwards in mine 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.229
 a skin 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.860
 so it looks nice and natural 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.580
 no hard transitions 6 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.590
 then I would mine 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.400
 eyebrows on but really only 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.560
 quite minimal, they make it easy 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.140
 could tolerate a little more color 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.310
 they are already visible and mine 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.049
 give a little more structure to the face 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 because a little one might not 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.140
 everybody's taste for a cent of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.390
 day make up is I take myself here 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.150
 this dark brown eyeshadow and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.549
 wear the eyebrows with my brush 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.190
 so close to my eyelashes 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.290
 I always do that in and on 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.200
 this must be small steps 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.250
 absolutely not perfect because 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.159
 then I agree 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.860
 cotton swabs and vision again 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.510
 the sick that the cats just around it 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.909
 hide again and more natural 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.990
 shape 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.759
 and then we come to one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.159
 personal favorite step and indeed 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.950
 the mascara and I'll take this 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.049
 media colossi mascara here though 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.329
 brown in the color I hope you can 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.919
 that a video where 10 in true that 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.770
 In any case, clearly visible and me 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.300
 find it out 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.900
 Of course it comes a lot of course 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.520
 as a fun and just for the work 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.230
 or for a subtle day make-up 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.900
 I think that's especially good 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.220
 to control as much or as little as you do 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.620
 you probably already want to know 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.450
 i like it a bit more i take 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.700
 then still around my eyelash curler 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.350
 my eyelashes just another 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 to give some momentum and ebola 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.950
 my eyes just a lot more 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.110
 awake open and radiant look 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.720
 I'll take this water here 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.580
 highlighter and wear just like one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.100
 normal kohl in my white 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.110
 Normally I always have line 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.690
 a white used but finds 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.540
 meanwhile this is a newcomer sound a lot 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.340
 looks more beautiful and natural after 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.040
 my eyes are finished , I take it 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.260
 my patrice anglo bronze and wearing 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 with a liquid brush on the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.130
 side of my face up and in 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.470
 so a three dimensionally as it gets here the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.820
 is a miracle on the cheek 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.860
 down to the chin 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.230
 that will also make the the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.540
 Sun, of course, first from yours 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.910
 face friend and that's why it looks 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.700
 whole very nice and of course like 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.190
 I personally find that I still 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.570
 get some more color my face 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.790
 and I look healthier 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.420
 a place a very light doe and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.190
 put that on my packet out of the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.970
 round look I use another 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.500
 pink lip gloss on my lips 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.110
 That would be the daytime look is very 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.910
 simple very subtle and super natural 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.459
 still really nice 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.350
 I trust myself like to work and 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.700
 what I do then for example 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.680
 go out in the evening 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.310
 I will tell you this during the week 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.560
 have fun with the same brush 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.570
 I 've been wearing before 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.090
 I now have a dull black 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.150
 Eyeshadow from the outer corner of your eye 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.730
 about the middle of my eye on the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.370
 simply compress the eyelashes again 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.520
 and makes the whole look a bit darker 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.310
 and blacker for more 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.830
 volume and longer namely me here one 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.290
 so false eyelashes and cut them in 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.949
 the middle once through should the 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.690
 be the same size 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.560
 Tweezers and tape next to me 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.290
 Outer edge of my eyelashes on it 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.840
 if you're a beginner for something wrong 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.610
 In any case, you should do so 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.229
 if I personally think so 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.190
 The simplest type is false eyelashes 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.720
 to stick 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.850
 and you will definitely get it all 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.490
 Here you can still see what I am wrong 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.750
 if tolerated that's why I do mine 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.669
 eyelashes so that they too 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.060
 same color comes with a black one 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:53.360
 Mask once up and down with it on 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.919
 each case nicely blended into each other and 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.050
 I continue my face 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.220
 something is competing and how is this here? 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.950
 I personally find that 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.500
 easiest way so just make a make up 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.990
 box or a sheet of paper as a border or 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.150
 to use as a template and a bit 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.500
 Apply a little bit more and bronze 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.060
 again beautiful blind it to it 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.620
 no hard lines in any case 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.110
 but that's nice of course 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.150
 looks and I think that makes up 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.310
 every time much more 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.080
 Extended and my face turned 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.990
 this much slimmer from the same 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.840
 I only do one forehead as well 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.910
 the sides and at the top of my nose 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.830
 because just some color in the 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.010
 middle of my face has to do that 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.870
 everything looks nice and not just one 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:41.030
 darker just once around a face 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.130
 around but the middle all bright then 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.960
 It may be a bit more with me in the evening 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.349
 I just put his place there 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.000
 a little more after the nude 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.190
 colored lipgloss I use it then 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.400
 something more elaborate and although I take 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.470
 this l'orÃ©al lip gloss sparkles 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.650
 super crass and I'm really nice 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.229
 a great pinka sound and that's it 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.830
 datalog and I hope you have it 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.020
 like 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.210
 that would be a great look just for everyone 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.070
 you do not like that much 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.950
 wear makeup like me but feel you 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.780
 free these look tags at night in the morning 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.580
 at noon was still to wear so 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.440
 long you feel good I hope you 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.060
 I liked it if so I would 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.680
 about a thumb up and 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.610
 continue your video wishes in the 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.560
 cult box happy 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.680
 yes thank you for watching until the next 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.680
 times
