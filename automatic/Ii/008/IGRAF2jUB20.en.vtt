that's his intention with the recording
model<00:00:09.450> was<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> guitar<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.290> would<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
model was a guitar that would have a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.830 
model was a guitar that would have a
very<00:00:11.250> flat<00:00:11.490> frequency<00:00:11.730> response<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.750> he

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
very flat frequency response that he

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.720 
very flat frequency response that he
could<00:00:13.019> simply<00:00:13.320> plug<00:00:13.620> into<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.920> mixing<00:00:14.280> console

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
could simply plug into a mixing console

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.300 
could simply plug into a mixing console
he<00:00:15.389> wanted<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> amplifier<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
he wanted to get the amplifier out of

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.790 
he wanted to get the amplifier out of
the<00:00:17.400> picture<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:18.510> amplifiers<00:00:19.199> by<00:00:19.439> nature

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the picture because amplifiers by nature

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.640 
the picture because amplifiers by nature
with<00:00:19.980> electric<00:00:20.340> guitars<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:20.970> color

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
with electric guitars you know color

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
with electric guitars you know color
signal<00:00:22.650> which<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.430> know<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.760> good<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.180> it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
signal which you know can be good but it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
signal which you know can be good but it
can<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.539> bad<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.320> far<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.680> Les<00:00:25.859> was

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
can be bad as as far as Les was

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
can be bad as as far as Les was
concerned<00:00:26.460> he<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.119> wanted<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> pure<00:00:27.660> guitar

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
concerned he just wanted the pure guitar

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
concerned he just wanted the pure guitar
sound<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.619> he<00:00:28.980> wanted<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.490> care<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
sound and he wanted to take care of it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.130 
sound and he wanted to take care of it
at<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> mixing<00:00:30.840> console<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.020> was

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
at the mixing console at the time it was

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
at the mixing console at the time it was
you<00:00:40.320> know<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> advanced<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you know kind of advanced for the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.119 
you know kind of advanced for the
average<00:00:41.910> player<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.780> nowadays<00:00:43.129> recording

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
average player but nowadays recording

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.440 
average player but nowadays recording
and<00:00:44.280> home<00:00:44.430> recording<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> lot<00:00:45.239> more

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and home recording is a lot more

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.150 
and home recording is a lot more
accessible<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> more<00:00:46.079> players<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.860> took<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
accessible to more players we took the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
accessible to more players we took the
original<00:00:47.579> intention<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> guitar<00:00:48.690> but

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
original intention of the guitar but

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.650 
original intention of the guitar but
made<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.770> modern-day<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:51.329> kept<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
made it you know modern-day so we kept a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.540 
made it you know modern-day so we kept a
lot<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> features<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.680> had<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.520> know

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
lot of the features that he had you know

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
lot of the features that he had you know
low<00:00:53.789> impedance<00:00:54.120> capability<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.980> also

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
low impedance capability but we also

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
low impedance capability but we also
added<00:00:56.460> high<00:00:56.730> impedance<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.719> well<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> can

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
added high impedance as well so you can

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.840 
added high impedance as well so you can
plug<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.039> regular<00:00:59.430> high<00:00:59.550> impedance

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
plug it into a regular high impedance

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.770 
plug it into a regular high impedance
app<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.260> sounds<00:01:01.949> tremendous

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
app it really sounds tremendous

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.549 
app it really sounds tremendous
especially<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:03.930> you're<00:01:04.049> coming<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
especially when you're coming out of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.740 
especially when you're coming out of
both<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> outputs<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.240> guitar<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
both of the outputs of the guitar the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
both of the outputs of the guitar the
highs<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> lows<00:01:07.560> E<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.150> going

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
highs and the lows E and what I'm going

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.950 
highs and the lows E and what I'm going
to<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> low<00:01:11.549> C<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.750> D

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to do now is go out of the low C into D

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.980 
to do now is go out of the low C into D
aw<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> record<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> high<00:01:15.689> Z

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
aw and record that and have the high Z

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
aw and record that and have the high Z
go<00:01:16.229> into<00:01:16.530> an<00:01:16.650> amplifier<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.030> actually

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
go into an amplifier so I can actually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.649 
go into an amplifier so I can actually
record<00:01:19.200> an<00:01:19.380> amp<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.670> D<00:01:20.790> aw<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> same

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
record an amp and a D aw at the same

00:01:21.659 --> 00:02:15.990 
record an amp and a D aw at the same
time

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.060
