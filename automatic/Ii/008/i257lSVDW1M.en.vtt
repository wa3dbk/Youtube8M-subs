00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.790
 Automatically translated by the machine. Welcome to another version of morning makeup 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.790
 I am doing my makeup and chatting with everyone! Today's look is a color, I usually don't wear it: 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.910
 coral! Start as usual. 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.050
 I am kicking, trying new things! I really don't know where I am going with 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
 This one, so I just started using some mascara. The new thing today is the coral eye shadow. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.000
 I tried this new pearl swing 88 palette. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 I made a light cream wash a little bit under the lip as a highlighter. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.070
 I love these huge palettes so much. It seems that there are so many varieties 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 You can use them. They are dreamlike to stay at home. 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.230
 I used a popular coral on the outer corner of my eye. 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.230
 I can honestly abandon my eyeshadow so that the big one agrees with the rest. 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.939
 I added half of the outer eyeliner to a deeper coral. 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.939
 I tried different crafts and I have been having fun at the moment. 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.369
 Then I mix it together. I tried to do interesting bleaching mode 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.740
 Some old clothes are born! I am surprised because I want them 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.710
 To suck! I lined up with a thin black lining. 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.710
 After that, I have been in the lounge, this huge shag carpet crochet, because we can't afford it 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.520
 A real one! I added a long wing for the idea. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.329
 The carpet will turn into something I don't know, but I almost have half the way, I like it! 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.409
 Although I decided what to do next, I added some pink lipstick. 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.070
 Do you often try new things? Or do you insist on using the same thing, you know? 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.849
 Then I said that there are about 3/4 of the eyelashes. I want to try something new, it is really the best 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.840
 Part of life. It doesn't seem to end completely, so I brought it 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.790
 Some corals come down to the lower eyeliner. 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.379
 In my next try list is some new nail art design. 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.200
 The light color of the inner corner of the eye and a little bit. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.670
 Now that I have grown up with my natural nails, I should be able to do them more often! 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.930
 And some blush... a little lip gloss, do it! 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.550
 Let me know if you have any ideas, I should try it. 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.110
 See, try new things, itâ€™s good, actually I really like this. 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.920
 I hope this is a useful video to check out the description of the blog post link 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.769
 More information and tutorials. Thank you very much for watching. 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.189
 Goodbye!
