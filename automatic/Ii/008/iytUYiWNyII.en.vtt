the<00:00:05.069> garden<00:00:05.430> what<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:05.879> need<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.330> something

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the garden what we need is something

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.270 
the garden what we need is something
that<00:00:07.160> will<00:00:08.160> detect<00:00:08.580> deer<00:00:09.120> coming<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.469> set

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
that will detect deer coming in and set

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.620 
that will detect deer coming in and set
off<00:00:11.429> an<00:00:11.639> alarm<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.969> will<00:00:12.179> scare<00:00:12.389> them<00:00:12.509> off

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
off an alarm that will scare them off

off an alarm that will scare them off
what<00:00:13.349> I've<00:00:13.469> got<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.219> an<00:00:15.230> old<00:00:16.430> motion

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
what I've got here is an old motion

of the house it was in a box with a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.939 
of the house it was in a box with a
bunch<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.580> other<00:00:26.699> stuff<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.740> didn't<00:00:28.740> really

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
bunch of other stuff that didn't really

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.440 
bunch of other stuff that didn't really
have<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.900> this<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:32.960> a

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
have a use for and this right here is a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
have a use for and this right here is a
solenoid<00:00:36.620> activated<00:00:39.469> water<00:00:40.469> valve<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.219> an

old washing machine what happens is 120
volts<00:00:45.539> across<00:00:45.660> these<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:47.129> activate<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
volts across these will activate a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.139 
volts across these will activate a
solenoid<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:49.230> allow<00:00:49.879> fluid<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> pass

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
solenoid that will allow fluid to pass

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
solenoid that will allow fluid to pass
from<00:00:51.800> this<00:00:53.960> point<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.219> into<00:00:56.219> either

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
from this point right here into either

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
from this point right here into either
one<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> these<00:00:57.120> depending<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
one of these depending on which one is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.119 
one of these depending on which one is
activated<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.609> what<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> did<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
activated now what I did here is I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.440 
activated now what I did here is I
opened<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:04.640> looked<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.760> everything<00:01:06.030> make

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
opened this up looked at everything make

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.359 
opened this up looked at everything make
sure<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.290> working<00:01:07.650> properly<00:01:08.510> and

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
sure it was all working properly and

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.080 
sure it was all working properly and
also<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:13.229> hole<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.580> middle<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:14.939> was

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
also that hole in the middle there was

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.520 
also that hole in the middle there was
very<00:01:15.299> small<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.630> guess<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> water<00:01:16.259> saving

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
very small I guess a water saving

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.149 
very small I guess a water saving
feature<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.009> took<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.540> drill<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.890> made<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> much

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
feature I took a drill bit made it much

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.960 
feature I took a drill bit made it much
bigger<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.700> will<00:01:20.850> allow<00:01:21.479> water<00:01:21.930> flow<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
bigger that will allow water flow to

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
bigger that will allow water flow to
actually<00:01:23.970> work<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:25.320> sprinkler<00:01:25.860> which

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
actually work the sprinkler which

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.870 
actually work the sprinkler which
requires<00:01:26.490> quite<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> bit<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.229> water<00:01:28.729> volume<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
requires quite a bit of water volume and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.010 
requires quite a bit of water volume and
pressure<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> got<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.869> I'm

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
pressure so got all that and now I'm

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.780 
pressure so got all that and now I'm
going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> reassemble<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:37.369> see<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
going to reassemble this and see if I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to reassemble this and see if I
can<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:40.110> motion<00:01:40.470> detector<00:01:41.390> activate

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
can make this motion detector activate

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.929 
can make this motion detector activate
those<00:01:42.540> solenoids<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
those solenoids if they will do what I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.990 
those solenoids if they will do what I
expect<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:45.840> I'll<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.140> hook<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.439> some<00:01:46.649> water

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
expect then I'll just hook up some water

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
expect then I'll just hook up some water
and<00:01:49.700> see<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.810> motion<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:52.140> set<00:01:52.799> off<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> water

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and see if motion will set off the water

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.649 
and see if motion will set off the water
sprinklers<00:01:55.790> after<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.119> all<00:01:57.210> assembled

and<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.830> works<00:02:39.010> good<00:02:39.280> I've<00:02:39.550> tested<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.620> motion

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
and it works good I've tested the motion

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.370 
and it works good I've tested the motion
detector<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.280> seems<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.640> work<00:02:42.670> okay<00:02:43.120> -<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.260> I've

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
detector it seems to work okay - so I've

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.380

got it plugged in to power everything is
wired<00:02:49.690> up<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.989> motion<00:02:56.680> detector<00:02:57.340> turns<00:02:58.090> off

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
wired up the motion detector turns off

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.020 
wired up the motion detector turns off
in<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.600> daytime<00:02:59.130> but<00:03:00.130> what<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.340> get<00:03:00.580> did<00:03:00.820> was

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
in the daytime but what I get did was

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.180 
in the daytime but what I get did was
cover<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.630> with<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.230> piece<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.920> black

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
cover it up with a piece of black

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.540 
cover it up with a piece of black
plastic<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.380> that's<00:03:05.380> pretty<00:03:05.560> much<00:03:05.680> activated

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
plastic and that's pretty much activated

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.340 
plastic and that's pretty much activated
it<00:03:06.700> that<00:03:07.120> will<00:03:07.330> set<00:03:07.600> off<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.750> sprinkler<00:03:08.320> for

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
it that will set off the sprinkler for

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.430 
it that will set off the sprinkler for
just<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.100> couple<00:03:09.280> minutes<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.930> then<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.290> will

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
just a couple minutes and then it will

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.130 
just a couple minutes and then it will
turn<00:03:14.680> off

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.980 

and<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.800> pistol<00:03:18.220> will<00:03:18.340> be<00:03:18.540> reactivated<00:03:19.540> and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
and a pistol will be reactivated and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:43.750 
and a pistol will be reactivated and
waiting<00:03:20.470> for<00:03:20.830> another<00:03:21.520> motion<00:03:22.360> terrific

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.220 

okay<00:03:44.760> they're<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.000> turned<00:03:45.450> itself<00:03:45.599> off<00:03:45.959> I'm

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
okay they're just turned itself off I'm

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.170 
okay they're just turned itself off I'm
still<00:03:46.440> holding<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> black<00:03:47.220> plastic<00:03:47.790> over<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
still holding the black plastic over the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.780 
still holding the black plastic over the
lens<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.769> motion<00:03:50.069> detector<00:03:50.459> I'm<00:03:50.580> going<00:03:50.730> to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
lens of the motion detector I'm going to

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.899 
lens of the motion detector I'm going to
move<00:03:50.909> it<00:03:51.090> out<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.299> way<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:55.650> then<00:03:56.580> cover<00:03:56.819> it

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
move it out of the way and then cover it

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:08.760 
move it out of the way and then cover it
back<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.120> again<00:04:02.450> doing<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.540> trick

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.430 

if<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.490> can't<00:04:09.880> melt<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.420> under<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.990> edge<00:04:11.200> of

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
if you can't melt this under the edge of

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.410 
if you can't melt this under the edge of
a<00:04:11.530> pump<00:04:11.770> out<00:04:11.980> which<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.850> right<00:04:13.000> next<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.270> the

wood I'm gonna hang that underneath the
eaves<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.990> pump<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:32.470> motion

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
eaves of the pump so that the motion

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.760 
eaves of the pump so that the motion

near<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.920> woods<00:04:36.130> where<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.550> deer<00:04:36.760> would<00:04:36.880> come

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
near the woods where the deer would come

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.070 
near the woods where the deer would come
in<00:04:38.370> here<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.670> have<00:04:40.090> put<00:04:40.420> in<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:41.190> socket<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:43.080> well

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
in here I have put in a socket and well

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.690 
in here I have put in a socket and well
it's<00:04:44.170> supposed<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.440> be<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> light<00:04:44.770> bulb<00:04:45.130> outlet

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
it's supposed to be a light bulb outlet

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.770 
it's supposed to be a light bulb outlet
and<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.510> pull<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.690> color<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:51.780> 150

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
and with that pull the color this 150

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.390 
and with that pull the color this 150

detector<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.480> whenever<00:05:07.870> something<00:05:08.260> trips

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
detector so whenever something trips

detector so whenever something trips
that<00:05:09.180> water<00:05:10.180> will<00:05:10.330> come<00:05:10.480> on<00:05:11.370> startup<00:05:12.370> through

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
that water will come on startup through

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520 
that water will come on startup through
water<00:05:12.730> sprinkler<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.510> turn<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:14.380> light

water sprinkler and turn on the light

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.160 
water sprinkler and turn on the light
hopefully<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:15.610> will<00:05:15.760> keep<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.090> deer<00:05:16.390> out<00:05:16.570> of

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
hopefully this will keep the deer out of

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.200 
hopefully this will keep the deer out of
the<00:05:17.590> corn<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.070> other<00:05:18.520> vegetables<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.090> were

the corn and other vegetables that were

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.540 
the corn and other vegetables that were
thrown<00:05:19.450> out<00:05:19.480> there

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.640 

okay<00:05:26.240> there<00:05:26.449> it<00:05:26.539> is<00:05:26.599> mounted<00:05:27.080> under<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.470> eaves

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
okay there it is mounted under the eaves

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.249 
okay there it is mounted under the eaves
of<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.310> pump<00:05:28.970> house<00:05:31.120> those<00:05:32.120> are<00:05:32.419> that's<00:05:32.870> corn

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
of the pump house those are that's corn

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.850 
of the pump house those are that's corn
right<00:05:33.440> there<00:05:33.620> in<00:05:33.710> front<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:33.979> it<00:05:35.650> now<00:05:36.650> what

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
right there in front of it now what

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.399 
right there in front of it now what
should<00:05:37.039> happen<00:05:37.250> when<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.639> move<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:39.229> light

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
should happen when I move the light

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:40.689 
should happen when I move the light
should<00:05:39.530> come<00:05:39.590> on<00:05:39.800> in<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.039> sprinkler<00:05:40.430> that

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
should come on in the sprinkler that

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:49.620 
should come on in the sprinkler that
should<00:05:41.030> activate

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.359 

sure<00:05:50.230> half

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:54.369 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:57.929 

that'll<00:05:55.169> come<00:05:56.169> on<00:05:56.349> and<00:05:56.559> stay<00:05:57.039> on<00:05:57.069> for<00:05:57.429> maybe<00:05:57.579> 30

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939 
that'll come on and stay on for maybe 30

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:04.969 
that'll come on and stay on for maybe 30
seconds<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:58.839> then<00:05:59.049> it<00:05:59.199> will<00:05:59.289> turn<00:05:59.529> back<00:05:59.739> off

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:13.980 

not<00:06:05.979> even<00:06:06.099> 30<00:06:06.459> seconds

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.529 

okay<00:06:14.650> that's<00:06:14.979> working<00:06:15.280> pretty<00:06:15.400> good

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
okay that's working pretty good

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.879 
okay that's working pretty good
hopefully<00:06:16.539> that'll<00:06:16.750> scare<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.530> deer<00:06:17.680> off

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
hopefully that'll scare the deer off

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:43.760 
hopefully that'll scare the deer off
when<00:06:18.130> they<00:06:18.220> come<00:06:18.250> in<00:06:18.520> here

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.469 

pretty<00:06:44.770> neat
