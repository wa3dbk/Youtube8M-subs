I'm<00:00:00.269> Jen<00:00:00.719> from<00:00:00.750> expertise<00:00:01.469> saying<00:00:01.800> right<00:00:02.280> now

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I'm Jen from expertise saying right now

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.940 
I'm Jen from expertise saying right now
I'm<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> talk<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.240> using

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
I'm going to talk to you about using

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.619 
I'm going to talk to you about using
circular<00:00:04.950> energy<00:00:05.130> while<00:00:06.000> fighting

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
circular energy while fighting

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.080 
circular energy while fighting
it's<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.350> tough<00:00:07.529> concept<00:00:07.770> but<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.880> bear<00:00:09.059> with

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
it's a tough concept but just bear with

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.560 
it's a tough concept but just bear with
me

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
me

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.890 
me
offensively<00:00:10.429> most<00:00:11.429> guys<00:00:11.670> there's<00:00:12.450> no<00:00:12.570> punches

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
offensively most guys there's no punches

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.780 
offensively most guys there's no punches
like<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.230> straight<00:00:14.040> straight<00:00:14.490> across

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
like this straight straight across

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.050 
like this straight straight across
across<00:00:15.509> up<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.500> straight<00:00:17.430> straight<00:00:17.789> across

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
across up up straight straight across

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880 
across up up straight straight across
across<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.320> sharp

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
across up up it's sharp

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.439 
across up up it's sharp
it's<00:00:20.160> good<00:00:20.400> technique<00:00:20.760> there's<00:00:21.029> nothing

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it's good technique there's nothing

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.410 
it's good technique there's nothing
wrong<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.580> better<00:00:23.789> but

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
wrong with it but you can be better but

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.390 
wrong with it but you can be better but
I<00:00:24.510> make<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> energy<00:00:25.109> circular<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.949> looks<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
I make the energy circular it looks a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.279 
I make the energy circular it looks a
little<00:00:26.490> more<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.970> circular<00:00:27.869> Circle

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
little more like this circular Circle

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.130 
little more like this circular Circle
Circle<00:00:28.560> Circle<00:00:28.830> Circle<00:00:29.539> it's<00:00:30.539> still<00:00:30.840> it's

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
Circle Circle Circle it's still it's

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
Circle Circle Circle it's still it's
still<00:00:31.550> straight<00:00:32.550> straight<00:00:32.880> across<00:00:33.210> across

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570

still straight straight across across
uppercut<00:00:34.260> uppercut<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.760> this

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
uppercut uppercut but you you see this

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.340 
uppercut uppercut but you you see this
all<00:00:37.980> right

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
all right

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.200 
all right
there's<00:00:40.350> circular<00:00:40.860> movement<00:00:41.250> defensively

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
there's circular movement defensively

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
there's circular movement defensively
where<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> block<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> shot<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.010> just

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
where you block a shot you want to just

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
where you block a shot you want to just
let<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:45.930> want<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.260> bet

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
let you know you don't want to just bet

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.170 
let you know you don't want to just bet
and<00:00:46.829> catch<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> straight<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.940> want<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and catch you straight on you want to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.319 
and catch you straight on you want to
shift<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.620> something<00:00:49.850> maybe<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.969> want

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
shift it off or something maybe I want

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.709 
shift it off or something maybe I want
to<00:00:51.739> absorb<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.360> maybe<00:00:54.360> want<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
to absorb it a little bit maybe want to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
to absorb it a little bit maybe want to
deflect<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> side<00:00:55.969> okay<00:00:56.969> when<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> slip

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
deflect it to the side okay when I slip

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
deflect it to the side okay when I slip
maybe<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.500> don't<00:00:58.680> always<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
maybe you know you don't always want to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.360 
maybe you know you don't always want to
do<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.340> maybe<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:01.039> have<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> kind

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
do this maybe I want to have this kind

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
do this maybe I want to have this kind
of<00:01:02.489> movement<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.390> why<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
of movement so why do you do this or one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.240 
of movement so why do you do this or one
it<00:01:05.850> gives<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.299> speed<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.680> I'm<00:01:07.860> throwing<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it gives you speed if I'm throwing a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.179 
it gives you speed if I'm throwing a
straight<00:01:08.460> punch<00:01:09.290> straight<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
straight punch straight out and then I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.730 
straight punch straight out and then I
have<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> pull<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> straight<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
have to pull it straight back this is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620 
have to pull it straight back this is
hard<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.130> need<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.520> energies<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> same

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
hard I need to energies to do the same

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
hard I need to energies to do the same
thing<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.990> need<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.409> energy<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.830> send<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> out

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
thing I need one energy to send it out

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.810 
thing I need one energy to send it out
another<00:01:18.150> energy<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:19.320> send<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> back<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.670> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
another energy to send it back but if I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.200 
another energy to send it back but if I
let<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> go<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.400> one<00:01:23.400> energy<00:01:23.580> sends<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
let it go like this one energy sends it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.899 
let it go like this one energy sends it
out<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.890> literally<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.700> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
out and back now don't literally do this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
out and back now don't literally do this
this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.270> an<00:01:27.450> exaggeration<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.350> want<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this is an exaggeration but I want you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
this is an exaggeration but I want you
on<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> smaller<00:01:29.759> level<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:31.040> ma-na<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
on a smaller level just ma-na right on a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.670 
on a smaller level just ma-na right on a
small<00:01:33.630> level<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.170> still<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> straight

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
small level so it's still a straight

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
small level so it's still a straight
punch<00:01:35.119> it's<00:01:36.119> still<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> straight<00:01:36.540> punch<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
punch it's still a straight punch but

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.240 
punch it's still a straight punch but
now<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.350> visualization<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
now I have this visualization of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.370 
now I have this visualization of
circulating<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.299> energy<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:40.049> come<00:01:40.229> back

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
circulating my energy it will come back

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
circulating my energy it will come back
to<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.390> now<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.689> throw<00:01:42.810> punches<00:01:42.990> faster

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to me and now I can throw punches faster

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
to me and now I can throw punches faster
because<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.399> using<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.909> energy<00:01:45.090> one

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
because I'm using one energy one

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.139 
because I'm using one energy one
energies<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.140> generating<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.159> okay

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
energies is generating all this okay

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.289 
energies is generating all this okay
we'll<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.810> energy<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.950> five<00:01:50.490> six<00:01:50.880> seven

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
we'll all one energy not five six seven

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
we'll all one energy not five six seven
five<00:01:51.450> six<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.290> energy<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.189> out

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
five six you know not energy going out

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.030 
five six you know not energy going out
energy<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.689> faster<00:01:55.049> brings<00:01:55.890> us

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
energy going in so it's faster brings us

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.980 
energy going in so it's faster brings us
to<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> next<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> flow<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.719> flow

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to the next thing to flow you will flow

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.730 
to the next thing to flow you will flow
better<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.310> less

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
better because now you use less

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.859 
better because now you use less
for<00:01:59.950> less<00:02:00.130> energy<00:02:00.579> so<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:01.180> can<00:02:01.420> keep<00:02:01.570> reusing

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
for less energy so you can keep reusing

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.920 
for less energy so you can keep reusing
the<00:02:02.320> same<00:02:02.530> energy<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:04.090> come<00:02:04.329> into<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.689> next

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
the same energy to come into the next

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.889 
the same energy to come into the next
punch<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.350> next<00:02:05.590> movement<00:02:06.009> or<00:02:06.729> slip<00:02:07.060> right<00:02:07.509> if

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
punch the next movement or slip right if

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.430 
punch the next movement or slip right if
I<00:02:08.080> slip<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.560> like<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.580> now<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.660> have

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
I slip up like this now I have to I have

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.699 
I slip up like this now I have to I have
to<00:02:11.590> pull<00:02:11.860> myself<00:02:12.069> over<00:02:12.340> point<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.709> okay

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
to pull myself over point but if I okay

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.839 
to pull myself over point but if I okay
but<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.220> use<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:17.500> circular<00:02:17.800> energy<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.550> can

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
but if I use this circular energy it can

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.670 
but if I use this circular energy it can
it<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.180> help<00:02:19.450> me<00:02:19.599> move<00:02:19.810> around<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.500> keep

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
it can help me move around it and keep

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.870 
it can help me move around it and keep
rotating<00:02:21.489> as<00:02:21.849> opposed<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> just<00:02:22.390> doing<00:02:22.630> this

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
rotating as opposed to just doing this

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.290 
rotating as opposed to just doing this
okay<00:02:25.530> now<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.310> where<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.180> this

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
okay now what is it really where is this

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.940 
okay now what is it really where is this
circular<00:02:28.750> energy<00:02:28.870> coming<00:02:29.290> from<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.769> not

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
circular energy coming from it's not

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.770 
circular energy coming from it's not
coming<00:02:30.280> from<00:02:30.340> my<00:02:30.519> shoulders<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> lot<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.390> guys<00:02:31.569> a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
coming from my shoulders a lot of guys a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.330 
coming from my shoulders a lot of guys a
lot<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.260> people<00:02:32.500> think<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.160> about

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
lot of people think that it's about

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.640 
lot of people think that it's about
moving<00:02:33.640> my<00:02:33.910> head<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.360> circle<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.900> move<00:02:35.410> my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
moving my head in a circle and move my

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.440 
moving my head in a circle and move my
shoulders<00:02:36.069> like<00:02:36.190> it's<00:02:36.519> not<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.120> not<00:02:37.299> it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
shoulders like it's not it's not it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.270 
shoulders like it's not it's not it
looks<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.049> but<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.739> can<00:02:38.950> still<00:02:39.130> throw

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
looks like this but I can still throw

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.240 
looks like this but I can still throw
straight<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.850> sharp<00:02:40.769> with<00:02:41.769> my<00:02:41.890> head<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
straight and sharp with my head in the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.100 
straight and sharp with my head in the
middle<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.700> I'm<00:02:43.180> still<00:02:43.390> using<00:02:43.569> circular

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
middle and I'm still using circular

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.660 
middle and I'm still using circular
energy<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.799> now<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:44.980> can't<00:02:45.310> see<00:02:45.519> it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
energy just that now you can't see it

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.870 
energy just that now you can't see it
but<00:02:46.269> I'm<00:02:46.390> still<00:02:46.630> using<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.989> still<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:48.160> so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
but I'm still using it still this so

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.240 
but I'm still using it still this so
where<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.209> comes<00:02:49.390> from<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.930> core<00:02:50.230> my<00:02:50.769> my

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
where it comes from it's a core my my

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.550 
where it comes from it's a core my my
core<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:52.060> moving<00:02:52.690> up<00:02:52.810> I'm<00:02:53.049> not<00:02:53.230> saying<00:02:53.500> that

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
core is moving up I'm not saying that

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.620 
core is moving up I'm not saying that
actually<00:02:53.830> move<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.310> hips<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.819> circle<00:02:55.150> no<00:02:55.299> no

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
actually move your hips in circle no no

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.120 
actually move your hips in circle no no
it's<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.959> energy<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> generate

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
it's just the energy that you generate

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's just the energy that you generate
imagine<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.209> there's<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.510> little<00:02:58.810> ball<00:02:59.049> in

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
imagine that there's a little ball in

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.030 
imagine that there's a little ball in
here<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:01.030> your<00:03:01.360> movements<00:03:01.780> are<00:03:02.040> going

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
here and and your movements are going

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160 
here and and your movements are going
along<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.519> edge<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.090> ball<00:03:04.390> not<00:03:04.690> cutting

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
along the edge of that ball not cutting

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.410 
along the edge of that ball not cutting
not<00:03:05.769> cutting<00:03:06.220> through<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.880> breaking<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
not cutting through it and breaking the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.630 
not cutting through it and breaking the
ball<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.560> way<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.070> much<00:03:09.280> easier<00:03:09.310> to

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
ball and this way it's so much easier to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.860 
ball and this way it's so much easier to
hold<00:03:09.910> your<00:03:10.090> balance<00:03:10.269> hold<00:03:10.630> your<00:03:10.780> ground

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
hold your balance hold your ground

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.530 
hold your balance hold your ground
contain<00:03:11.799> your<00:03:12.010> energy<00:03:12.370> have<00:03:12.730> more<00:03:13.000> power<00:03:13.299> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
contain your energy have more power and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.930 
contain your energy have more power and
keep<00:03:13.750> reusing<00:03:14.079> that<00:03:14.620> power<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:15.760> to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
keep reusing that power just to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940 
keep reusing that power just to
circulate<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.959> how<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.140> come<00:03:17.380> out<00:03:17.410> strikes

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
circulate it how to come out strikes

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.650 
circulate it how to come out strikes
again<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.459> strikes<00:03:18.760> again<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.150> strikes<00:03:19.420> again

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
again it strikes again it strikes again

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.140 
again it strikes again it strikes again
maybe<00:03:20.140> comes<00:03:20.380> back<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.160> diverting<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
maybe comes back you you diverting it to

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.849 
maybe comes back you you diverting it to
defensive<00:03:22.630> movement<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.290> movement<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.680> all

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
defensive movement the movement is all

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.500 
defensive movement the movement is all
in<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.100> court<00:03:24.340> my<00:03:24.670> punch<00:03:24.970> can<00:03:25.180> still<00:03:25.390> be

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
in the court my punch can still be

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.930 
in the court my punch can still be
straight<00:03:25.810> hooks<00:03:26.739> are<00:03:26.920> across<00:03:27.100> uppercut

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
straight hooks are across uppercut

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.370 
straight hooks are across uppercut
yeah<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.359> can<00:03:28.540> have<00:03:28.660> my<00:03:28.750> head<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:28.930> said<00:03:29.140> there's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
yeah I can have my head I said there's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.410 
yeah I can have my head I said there's
no<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.739> don't<00:03:29.920> have<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.340> do<00:03:30.850> all<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.209> my

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
no I don't have to do all this my

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.420 
no I don't have to do all this my
shoulders<00:03:31.810> can<00:03:31.930> be<00:03:31.989> tight<00:03:32.799> wherever<00:03:33.310> they

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
shoulders can be tight wherever they

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.690 
shoulders can be tight wherever they
need<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.730> be<00:03:33.880> but<00:03:34.329> my<00:03:34.359> energy<00:03:34.920> inside<00:03:35.920> is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
need to be but my energy inside is
