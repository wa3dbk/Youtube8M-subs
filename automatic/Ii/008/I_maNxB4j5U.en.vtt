00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.909
 hello good morning the sun comes out chelsea the director of series together with 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.569
 and we want to prove it 12 the new security ombudsman 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.719
 by the way is detected in months 4-1 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.620
 for it or the sony that does not know 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.560
 it's going to be the wii version 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.000
 of victims of this phenomenon 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 We were going to open on Fridays 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 we have not achieved it with code 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520
 weeks 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 we are going to do the test in which we see how to sit the contacts and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.990
 even make a call 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.100
 the young man 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.880
 even if we have the phone 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.769
 with the 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.050
 of the iphone although we have not blocked with that security code marÃ­n 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.460
 then let's see the test 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.100
 percent the of 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.540
 they ask us for more security 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 we are excited sbs 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.890
 we mark 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.970
 three yellow 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.570
 the servers and in the world 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.229
 of powerlifting and at the moment we are going to call you 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 we press power also let us pass 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.650
 to the agenda we have the evidence that in just a few weeks 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 in terms of percent contacts 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.270
 2 almost more difficult to leave your land p mc 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.240
 is what to do 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.220
 at the labor table 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.340
 efe all 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 finished the fashion 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 where we have to enter a code to mix them 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.439
 well that's it this time it's simple inns 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.980
 that's fine 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.640
 the strange case or enter through imminent codes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.479
 a complication hooking it to the meazza computer and consigned to a 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.270
 failure 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.879
 the quite serious injuries 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.620
 almost two hours away we wanted to show aspects to the other and we're going to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.179
 what's ours
