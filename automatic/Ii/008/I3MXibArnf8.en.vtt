revolution rope okay
um<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:24.990> what's<00:00:25.199> called<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> rev<00:00:25.710> X

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
um they have what's called the rev X

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.320 
um they have what's called the rev X
which<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.180> also<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.990> same<00:00:28.439> handle<00:00:29.400> but

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
which is also the same handle but

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.350 
which is also the same handle but
different<00:00:30.750> wire<00:00:31.050> okay<00:00:31.679> they<00:00:32.279> both<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.790> really

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
different wire okay they both go really

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.280 
different wire okay they both go really
fast<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.710> you're<00:00:34.860> doing<00:00:35.219> say<00:00:35.600> 30<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> 50

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
fast now if you're doing say 30 to 50

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
fast now if you're doing say 30 to 50
unbroken<00:00:38.010> double<00:00:38.489> unders<00:00:38.760> efficiently

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
unbroken double unders efficiently

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.840 
unbroken double unders efficiently
they're<00:00:39.809> not<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.710> knees<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.370> jacking

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
they're not like your knees are jacking

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
they're not like your knees are jacking
up<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> keeping<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.050> nice<00:00:43.200> tight

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
up and down and keeping that nice tight

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.529 
up and down and keeping that nice tight
body<00:00:43.710> position<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.910> would<00:00:45.149> probably<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
body position this would probably be a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.139 
body position this would probably be a
good<00:00:45.719> rope<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
good rope for you to get going on that

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.270 
good rope for you to get going on that
okay<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> only<00:00:49.350> difference<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:50.129> these

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
okay now the only difference with these

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.450 
okay now the only difference with these
is<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.879> um<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.770> bare<00:00:52.770> wire<00:00:52.980> goes<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> little

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
is that um the bare wire goes a little

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.080 
is that um the bare wire goes a little
bit<00:00:53.670> faster<00:00:54.149> than<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> coated<00:00:54.780> wire<00:00:54.960> okay<00:00:56.090> all

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
bit faster than the coated wire okay all

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
bit faster than the coated wire okay all
right<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> your

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
right this one right here is your

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090 
right this one right here is your
standard<00:00:59.820> beginner<00:01:00.480> jump<00:01:00.870> rope<00:01:01.079> okay<00:01:01.890> there's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
standard beginner jump rope okay there's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
standard beginner jump rope okay there's
no<00:01:02.280> bearings<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> inside<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.690> just

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
no bearings on the inside it's just

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
no bearings on the inside it's just
plastic<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> plastic<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:05.250> doesn't<00:01:05.309> really

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
plastic on plastic it doesn't really

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
plastic on plastic it doesn't really
spin<00:01:05.970> much<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.170> first<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
spin much at all but at first when you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
spin much at all but at first when you
start<00:01:07.770> jumping<00:01:08.280> rope<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.000> wire<00:01:09.360> it's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
start jumping rope with the wire it's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.450 
start jumping rope with the wire it's
going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.439> faster<00:01:10.950> than<00:01:11.100> what<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.430> used

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to go faster than what you're used

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
going to go faster than what you're used
to<00:01:11.729> people<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.240> typically<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.200> bare

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
is a little bit better quality this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
is a little bit better quality this
one's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.640> rogue<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.119> alright<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.890> one

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
one's a rogue one alright and this one

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
one's a rogue one alright and this one
has<00:01:29.460> also<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.270> same<00:01:30.479> bearing<00:01:30.840> construction

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
has also the same bearing construction

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
has also the same bearing construction
but<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> spins<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:32.939> more

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
but it spins a little bit more

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.719 
but it spins a little bit more
consistently<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.619> has<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> metal<00:01:35.220> handle

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
consistently and it has the metal handle

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.920 
consistently and it has the metal handle
here<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.409> opposed<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:38.390> right<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> has<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
here as opposed to right here has the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
here as opposed to right here has the
plastic<00:01:40.340> with<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.520> metal<00:01:41.970> construction

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
plastic with this metal construction

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
plastic with this metal construction
right<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.320> opposed<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> plastic

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
right here as opposed to the plastic

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.969 
right here as opposed to the plastic
this<00:01:45.240> tends<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.810> stand<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.890> bit

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this tends to stand up to a little bit

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
this tends to stand up to a little bit
more<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> CrossFit<00:01:47.939> beating<00:01:48.390> they're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
more of a CrossFit beating they're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.679 
more of a CrossFit beating they're
pretty<00:01:49.799> close<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.340> same<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
pretty close to the same this one

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
pretty close to the same this one
doesn't<00:01:52.049> spin<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.590> consistent<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.579> one

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
doesn't spin as consistent as this one

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.789 
doesn't spin as consistent as this one
does<00:01:54.140> okay<00:01:55.170> however<00:01:56.070> um<00:01:57.170> they<00:01:58.170> still<00:01:58.229> spin

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
does okay however um they still spin

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.539 
does okay however um they still spin
pretty<00:01:59.130> good

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
pretty good

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.590 
pretty good
okay<00:02:00.920> now<00:02:01.920> finally<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> Cadillac<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> jump

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600

the reason why you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.670 
the reason why you
is<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.359> tennis<00:02:13.659> racket<00:02:14.019> tape<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.379> not<00:02:14.439> just

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
is the tennis racket tape and not just

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800 
is the tennis racket tape and not just
like<00:02:14.829> some<00:02:15.010> canvas<00:02:15.430> tape<00:02:15.640> because<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.569> tends

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
like some canvas tape because this tends

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.209 
like some canvas tape because this tends
to<00:02:16.989> take<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.379> your<00:02:17.530> sweat<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> little<00:02:18.099> bit

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
better and I can just barely hold on to

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.030 
better and I can just barely hold on to
it<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.760> stays<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.209> my<00:02:22.239> hand<00:02:22.629> this<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.590> will

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
it it stays in my hand this one will

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.619 
it it stays in my hand this one will
spin<00:02:24.370> for<00:02:24.400> days<00:02:24.909> if<00:02:25.439> you<00:02:26.439> are<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> beginner<00:02:27.629> hold

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
unders alright now let's talk about jump

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.979 
unders alright now let's talk about jump
rope<00:02:34.569> length<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:36.730> you're<00:02:36.879> starting<00:02:37.239> off<00:02:37.540> and

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
rope length when you're starting off and

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.530 
rope length when you're starting off and
this<00:02:38.200> isn't<00:02:38.379> mine<00:02:38.709> but<00:02:38.879> it's<00:02:39.879> maybe<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.299> good

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
this isn't mine but it's maybe a good

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.920 
this isn't mine but it's maybe a good
one

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
one

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.699 
one
use<00:02:41.290> alright<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:42.790> would<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.269> kind<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.349> short

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
use alright this would be kind of short

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.920 
use alright this would be kind of short
for<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.489> beginner<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.359> definitely<00:02:46.750> want<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
for the beginner you definitely want to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.990 
for the beginner you definitely want to
start<00:02:47.290> with<00:02:47.889> your<00:02:48.040> jump<00:02:48.310> rope<00:02:48.459> stand<00:02:48.790> over

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
start with your jump rope stand over

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.569 
start with your jump rope stand over
with<00:02:49.120> both<00:02:49.269> feet<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.769> have<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.189> right<00:02:51.340> about

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
with both feet and have it right about

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.949 
with both feet and have it right about
the<00:02:51.819> sternum<00:02:52.239> that's<00:02:52.419> a<00:02:52.540> good<00:02:52.750> beginning

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the sternum that's a good beginning

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.199 
the sternum that's a good beginning
position<00:02:53.500> now<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.519> reason<00:02:54.849> why<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:54.939> say

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
position now the reason why I say

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.119 
position now the reason why I say
beginning<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.840> because<00:02:55.870> when<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.889> start

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
beginning is because when you start

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.649 
beginning is because when you start
doing<00:02:57.280> your<00:02:57.400> double<00:02:57.760> unders<00:02:58.000> your<00:02:58.150> hands<00:02:58.480> want

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
doing your double unders your hands want

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.530 
doing your double unders your hands want
to<00:02:58.750> drift<00:02:59.049> out<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.219> what<00:03:00.400> happens<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
to drift out and so what happens is the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.809 
to drift out and so what happens is the
more<00:03:01.750> they<00:03:01.870> drift<00:03:02.139> out<00:03:02.379> unless<00:03:03.099> look<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.639> more

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
more they drift out unless look the more

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.599 
more they drift out unless look the more
likely<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.959> are<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.139> hit<00:03:05.379> your<00:03:05.560> feet<00:03:05.919> with<00:03:06.579> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
likely you are to hit your feet with the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.659 
likely you are to hit your feet with the
jumper<00:03:07.060> okay<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.139> when<00:03:08.889> you<00:03:09.010> have<00:03:09.189> it<00:03:09.219> here<00:03:09.549> if

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
jumper okay so when you have it here if

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.500 
jumper okay so when you have it here if
you<00:03:09.760> listen<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.239> how<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.480> hits<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.019> ground

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
you listen to how it hits the ground

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.250 
you listen to how it hits the ground
just<00:03:13.510> right<00:03:13.719> there<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.840> makes<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.109> lot<00:03:17.199> of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
just right there it makes a lot of

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.479 
just right there it makes a lot of
contact<00:03:17.799> with<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:18.010> ground<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.430> like

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
contact with the ground it's like

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.210 
contact with the ground it's like
hitting<00:03:18.669> speed<00:03:19.060> bumps<00:03:19.419> okay<00:03:20.139> so<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.949> better

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
hitting speed bumps okay so the better

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.819 
hitting speed bumps okay so the better
you<00:03:21.430> get<00:03:21.729> the<00:03:22.389> shorter<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.139> rope<00:03:23.349> you<00:03:23.530> want<00:03:23.709> to

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
you get the shorter the rope you want to

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.159 
you get the shorter the rope you want to
use<00:03:23.919> this<00:03:24.159> one's<00:03:24.430> mine<00:03:24.729> that<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.239> was<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.750> don't

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
use this one's mine that I was I don't

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.219 
use this one's mine that I was I don't
always<00:03:26.349> use<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:26.889> one<00:03:27.129> of<00:03:27.159> mine<00:03:27.430> actually

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
always use but it's one of mine actually

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.949 
always use but it's one of mine actually
this<00:03:29.229> was<00:03:29.470> my<00:03:29.500> wife's<00:03:30.269> she's<00:03:31.269> five<00:03:31.510> feet<00:03:31.750> tall

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
this was my wife's she's five feet tall

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.439 
this was my wife's she's five feet tall
but<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:32.889> think<00:03:33.189> mine<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.879> use<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.209> still

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
but I think mine that I use is still

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.219 
but I think mine that I use is still
this<00:03:34.599> length<00:03:34.900> alright<00:03:35.650> from<00:03:35.859> here<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.780> barely

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
this length alright from here it barely

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.819 
this length alright from here it barely
hits<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:38.590> ground<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.129> can<00:03:39.310> keep<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.639> going

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
hits the ground and I can keep it going

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.670 
hits the ground and I can keep it going
same<00:03:41.829> thing<00:03:42.069> with<00:03:42.220> my<00:03:42.400> other<00:03:42.430> one<00:03:42.699> and<00:03:43.680> take

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
same thing with my other one and take

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.229 
same thing with my other one and take
you<00:03:44.799> know<00:03:44.919> this<00:03:45.129> one<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.609> this<00:03:45.729> one's<00:03:45.939> fitted

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
you know this one that this one's fitted

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.599 
you know this one that this one's fitted
to<00:03:46.359> me<00:03:46.509> yeah<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.650> right<00:03:47.889> about<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.220> same<00:03:48.430> as

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
to me yeah it's right about the same as

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.219 
to me yeah it's right about the same as
where<00:03:48.729> my<00:03:48.849> wife's<00:03:49.060> at<00:03:49.269> now<00:03:49.479> hers<00:03:50.019> would

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
where my wife's at now hers would

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.020 
where my wife's at now hers would
probably<00:03:50.590> get<00:03:50.739> progressively<00:03:51.609> a<00:03:51.729> little<00:03:51.939> bit

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
probably get progressively a little bit

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.270 
probably get progressively a little bit
shorter<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:52.479> next<00:03:52.720> couple<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.079> weeks<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.590> say

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
shorter the next couple of weeks I say

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.890
