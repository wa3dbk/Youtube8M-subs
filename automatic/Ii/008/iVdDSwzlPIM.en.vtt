have 20 years old with the steps one or

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.490 
have 20 years old with the steps one or
two<00:00:23.160> rows<00:00:23.480> there<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.750> possible<00:00:25.200> to<00:00:25.320> use<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
two rows there it's possible to use a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
two rows there it's possible to use a
machine<00:00:25.919> but<00:00:26.130> only<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.520> spray<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> mean

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
machine but only to spray so what I mean

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.359 
machine but only to spray so what I mean
is<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> region<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is that here in this region in the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.570 
is that here in this region in the
region<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.900> when<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.199> talk<00:00:31.439> about

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
region I think when we talk about

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.470 
region I think when we talk about
machines<00:00:32.580> it<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.199> very<00:00:35.059> specific<00:00:36.059> way

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
machines it so it's a very specific way

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.509 
machines it so it's a very specific way
of<00:00:36.839> talking<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.830> only<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.400> the

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
of talking because it's only to do the

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.009 
of talking because it's only to do the
spraying<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.089> little<00:00:39.360> help<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
spraying it's a little help for the

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.170 
spraying it's a little help for the
treatment<00:00:40.260> or<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:41.519> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
treatment or for a little bit of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.200 
treatment or for a little bit of
herbicide<00:00:42.720> we<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.170> use<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.059> anything<00:00:45.059> else

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
herbicide we can use and anything else

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
herbicide we can use and anything else
we<00:00:45.480> always<00:00:45.960> pick<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.320> hand<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:47.610> we

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
we always pick on hand because we

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.080 
we always pick on hand because we
distinct<00:00:48.360> lines<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:49.350> difficult<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.090> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
distinct lines it's very difficult to to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.590 
distinct lines it's very difficult to to
use<00:00:51.270> machine

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.120 

the<00:00:59.600> old<00:00:59.750> vineyards<00:01:00.410> we<00:01:00.650> have<00:01:00.830> everything

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
the old vineyards we have everything

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.580 
the old vineyards we have everything
blended<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.940> vineyard<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:02.810> do<00:01:03.020> an<00:01:03.200> average

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
blended in the vineyard we do an average

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.400 
blended in the vineyard we do an average
and<00:01:03.920> then<00:01:04.460> we<00:01:04.940> pick<00:01:05.180> all<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.720> grape<00:01:05.900> varieties

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
and then we pick all the grape varieties

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.800 
and then we pick all the grape varieties
blended<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.160> we<00:01:07.340> separated<00:01:07.970> by<00:01:08.180> vineyard<00:01:08.600> by

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
blended but we separated by vineyard by

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.650 
blended but we separated by vineyard by
plot<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.100> vinified<00:01:10.580> separated<00:01:11.480> by

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
plot and then we vinified separated by

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.020 
plot and then we vinified separated by
vineyard<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.410> we<00:01:12.800> keep<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.130> separate<00:01:13.610> until

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
vineyard and we keep it separate until

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:35.749 
vineyard and we keep it separate until
we<00:01:14.240> do<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.540> final<00:01:14.750> plan<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.470> before

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.490 

so<00:01:36.759> this<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.330> first<00:01:37.570> part<00:01:37.930> of<00:01:38.259> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
so this is the first part of the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.490 
so this is the first part of the
fermentation<00:01:39.070> room<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.570> our<00:01:40.900> grapes<00:01:41.229> like

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
fermentation room all our grapes like

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.530 
fermentation room all our grapes like
marionette<00:01:42.009> told<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.490> they<00:01:42.729> are<00:01:42.759> picked<00:01:43.360> in

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
marionette told you they are picked in

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.770 
marionette told you they are picked in
24<00:01:44.049> kilo<00:01:44.290> cases<00:01:44.740> hand-picked<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.790> they<00:01:46.479> are

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
24 kilo cases hand-picked and they are

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.170 
24 kilo cases hand-picked and they are
all<00:01:47.259> brought<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.950> hear<00:01:48.280> we're<00:01:48.490> outside<00:01:49.030> that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
all brought to hear we're outside that

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.080 
all brought to hear we're outside that
door<00:01:49.420> we<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.930> sorting<00:01:50.440> table<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.039> we<00:01:51.940> have

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
door we have a sorting table and we have

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.570 
door we have a sorting table and we have
normally<00:01:52.479> for<00:01:52.750> people<00:01:53.110> they're<00:01:53.490> sorting<00:01:54.490> out

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
normally for people they're sorting out

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.670 
normally for people they're sorting out
all<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.880> grapes<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.149> are<00:01:55.270> overripe<00:01:55.840> unripe

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
all the grapes that are overripe unripe

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.800 
all the grapes that are overripe unripe
or<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.520> notice<00:01:57.789> it<00:01:57.939> has<00:01:57.970> any<00:01:58.360> sort<00:01:58.630> of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
or that we notice it has any sort of

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.320 
or that we notice it has any sort of
disease<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.619> stays<00:01:59.860> outside<00:02:00.460> outside<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
disease it stays outside outside the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.899 
disease it stays outside outside the
winery<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:01.990> then<00:02:02.710> they<00:02:02.860> go<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.220> crusher<00:02:03.759> and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
winery and then they go to a crusher and

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.850 
winery and then they go to a crusher and
this<00:02:04.090> steamer<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:05.020> they<00:02:05.320> are<00:02:05.470> pumped

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
this steamer and then they are pumped

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.290 
this steamer and then they are pumped
here<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.369> all<00:02:06.550> our<00:02:06.580> grapes<00:02:06.940> are<00:02:07.119> one<00:02:07.240> hundred

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
here so all our grapes are one hundred

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.440 
here so all our grapes are one hundred
percent<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.899> 10<00:02:08.459> only<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.789> barycenter

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
percent is 10 only the barycenter

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.449 
percent is 10 only the barycenter
entered<00:02:10.869> lagares<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.590> these<00:02:12.190> are<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
entered lagares and these are the

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.430 
entered lagares and these are the
traditional<00:02:13.000> granite<00:02:13.690> stone<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.140> guards

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
traditional granite stone the guards

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.500 
traditional granite stone the guards
that<00:02:14.530> were<00:02:14.769> normally<00:02:15.430> used<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.730> vilify<00:02:16.090> port

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
that were normally used to vilify port

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.960 
that were normally used to vilify port
wine<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.230> also<00:02:17.350> do<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:18.040> vilify<00:02:18.549> a<00:02:18.700> red

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
wine but we also do it to vilify a red

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.420 
wine but we also do it to vilify a red
wine<00:02:19.120> or<00:02:21.630> white<00:02:22.630> wines<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.590> has<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.830> problem

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
wine or white wines it has a problem

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.309 
wine or white wines it has a problem
that<00:02:24.940> oxidation<00:02:26.549> in<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.700> white<00:02:27.880> wine<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:29.049> want

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
that oxidation in a white wine you want

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.160 
that oxidation in a white wine you want
to<00:02:29.560> keep<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.980> color<00:02:30.430> or<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.120> much<00:02:31.690> as<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.900> can

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
to keep the color or as much as you can

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.590 
to keep the color or as much as you can
so<00:02:32.799> because<00:02:33.069> it's<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.310> completely<00:02:33.700> open<00:02:33.819> press

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
so because it's a completely open press
