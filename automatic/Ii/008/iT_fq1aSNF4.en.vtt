00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello youtube inmates I'm from soul master 21 and today I bring you my first story 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.809
 talks about some very curious curiosities about a game that is very well known 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.980
 all and that of course should have marked his childhood yes I'm talking 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 of the pokémon blu pokémon red and pokémon griñán games maybe you're 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720
 stories disappointed in a bit the fans of why and rode one of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.480
 this is a terrifying story that was presented in only three cartridges of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.800
 pokémon network and crime the Japanese version so if they have a game boy 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.680
 and a pokémon network do not throw it good the story is the story called 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.420
 white jane sprite or the esprit e of the white hand 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.470
 white hand white jane sprite is one of the supposed three visual effects 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.730
 present only in a few impressions of the first edition of pokémon red 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.510
 and brin is said to have been added in a hidden way by some programmers of the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.660
 game 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.790
 Well, the white hand was supposedly programmed to appear 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.130
 on the third floor of the town tower the band 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.450
 it is said that the image of the white hand represents a paralyzed hand and 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.430
 somewhat decayed 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.789
 with a surprisingly precise detail 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.790
 the hand torn from his body the flesh comes from the end of the hand and the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.640
 tendons hang from the wrist with extreme realism to be an esprit 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 It is 8 bits 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 or my god what disgust xd xd xd this esprit e that acts as pokémon owns 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 four animations 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.630
 the appearance of the cry that all pokémon usually emit before a battle 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.450
 and two attacks 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.780
 These attacks are called fist and brutal 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.619
 the fist attack responds to the animation of that own hand picking up on 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.310
 fist shape and addressing your pokémon 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.560
 the brutal attack however seems to lack many frames in the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 animation 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 the hand seems to open 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.300
 cutting yourself 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.430
 after a while 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.830
 reappears closed again 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.400
 no recording of such animations could be found 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.820
 but yes there is what seems to be the esprit I have taken from the rom 1 0 of the hand 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.700
 white 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.050
 And this is just the beginning 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.320
 should biden model at the end of the history of the tower the band arrivals 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.060
 at the end and you found a tomb of a deceased marwat that you have to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 deal 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.729
 using the sip neckline 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.080
 reveals its original form and defeats calming its soul and returning it to 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.639
 Eternal rest 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.129
 here is a vips present in the one generation where using a simple 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.039
 poker or you could be confused by the sea water 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:26.389
 because according to this story the tomb of the sea when replaced by the image of a 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.119
 man buried on the ground still alive 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.579
 when you reach the top floor it will automatically be a conversation 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.389
 direct with him 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.409
 buried alive these 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.899
 I'm trapped 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.299
 and I am alone 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.959
 very lonely 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.519
 from unesa me 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.519
 after this you enter battle sequence 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.649
 The man buried is displayed as coach 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.019
 on his campus he has two white hands a gene gary a 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.269
 apparently the expected is that not leganés 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.659
 if you defeat it the game hangs up because I do not know wrote any function in 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.119
 victory case 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:05.869
 and if you lose 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.699
 the battle ends you return to the usual sight and the buried man answers 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.739
 between a strange gibberish 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.869
 at last 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.619
 fresh meat 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.579
 Your character is dragged to the buried 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.719
 the screen goes dark and finally only a black background appears with the 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.139
 creepy image of the buried man devouring your character 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.669
 it does not reappear it is in the center pokémon obviously 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:31.620
 the worst is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.060
 As much as you try to turn off the console remove the cartridge, give it to the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.499
 wall and restart do not come out and the green bay home screen 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 only the image of the man buried devouring t 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.499
 Again there is no visual evidence of such phenomenon 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:50.779
 aside it is almost impossible to find any of the alleged cartridges of the 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.779
 first generation that came out with these characters 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.349
 Well, the truth is that this story is a bit of a story but it is what there is xd xd xd xd 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.389
 from dd dd 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.109
 good here I'm going with some curiosities to get the fear 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.829
 the first one are some similarities between me it locates something curious to get to 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.849
 compare these two because 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.269
 meoquí dito both have the same color also share the same color without me 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.269
 also none has gender both have their equal status and also 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.370
 both weigh exactly the same four kilograms 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.190
 but where they are most similar is that both are the only pokémon that can be 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.319
 transform what does this mean 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.690
 I'm leaving with has the DNA of all the immoral pot 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.180
 that's why he is considered the ancestor of all pokémon and is capable of 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.779
 transform into each of them 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.349
 but because he also edited 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.939
 perhaps dictated also possesses the weapon of all pot inman 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.819
 How is that possible 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.930
 actually the disks are the failed meego clones that were discarded 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.149
 good until the video ends I hope you liked it please comment 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.779
