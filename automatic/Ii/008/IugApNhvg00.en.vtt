00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
decent sized cabbage head this isn't

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.980 
decent sized cabbage head this isn't
actually<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.820> knee-high<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.869> bit

actually a knee-high it's a little bit

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.249 
actually a knee-high it's a little bit
shorter<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.759> what<00:01:32.759> we're<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:34.110> are

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
shorter so what we're gonna do is we are

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.980 
shorter so what we're gonna do is we are
going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> take<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.130> knee-high<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.030> we're

going to take this knee-high and we're
going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> central<00:01:39.390> leaves<00:01:40.759> I'm

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
going to take the central leaves I'm

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.260 
going to take the central leaves I'm
turning<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.150> inside<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.570> over<00:01:43.020> my<00:01:43.170> hand<00:01:43.470> here

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
turning it inside out over my hand here

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.889 
turning it inside out over my hand here
where<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> take<00:01:45.600> these<00:01:45.780> central<00:01:46.290> leaves<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
where it take these central leaves and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.230 
where it take these central leaves and
fold<00:01:48.899> them<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.140> around<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> head<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.240> then

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
fold them up around the head and then

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.350 
fold them up around the head and then
I'm<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.420> gonna<00:01:51.720> pull<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:53.340> knee-high<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I'm just gonna pull the knee-high if I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.740 
I'm just gonna pull the knee-high if I
can<00:01:55.040> down<00:01:56.040> over<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> head<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> guess<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.570> should

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
can down over the head I guess I should

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.609 
can down over the head I guess I should
have<00:01:57.840> done<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.380> were<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.530> little

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
have done this when they were a little

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.730 
have done this when they were a little
bit<00:01:59.070> smaller<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:01.500> what's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
bit smaller but you know what what's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.730 
bit smaller but you know what what's
gonna<00:02:01.920> happen<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.549> hopefully<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.560> an

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
gonna happen is hopefully this is an

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.940 
gonna happen is hopefully this is an
experiment<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.960> head<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
experiment that the head is going to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.240 
experiment that the head is going to
continue<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.670> grow

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.360 

and<00:02:11.910> whatever<00:02:12.120> may<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.990> there<00:02:13.260> will<00:02:13.470> be

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and whatever may be in there will be

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.320 
and whatever may be in there will be
deflected<00:02:15.060> by<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.450> diatomaceous<00:02:16.110> earth<00:02:17.330> this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
deflected by the diatomaceous earth this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
deflected by the diatomaceous earth this
can<00:02:18.570> be<00:02:18.660> kinda<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.170> bank<00:02:19.410> robber<00:02:19.530> cabbage

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
can be kinda like a bank robber cabbage

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.410 
can be kinda like a bank robber cabbage
guys<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:22.020> continue<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> grow<00:02:23.180> okay

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
guys this will continue to grow okay

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.870 
guys this will continue to grow okay
but<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:25.020> sneak<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.650> will<00:02:25.890> stop<00:02:26.220> any

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the elastic part at the bottom goes down

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.700 
the elastic part at the bottom goes down
around<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.960> stem<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.710> protects<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.710> see

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710
