00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and like I couldn't really this one

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.430 
and like I couldn't really this one
could<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:42.700> really<00:02:43.090> come<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.420> handy<00:02:43.450> when<00:02:44.380> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
could have really come in handy when I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.260 
could have really come in handy when I
did<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.890> leopard<00:02:45.190> print<00:02:45.430> yesterday<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.240> i

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
did the leopard print yesterday but i

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.760 
did the leopard print yesterday but i
actually<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:46.810> did<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.170> with<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.320> dotting<00:02:47.620> tool

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
actually just did it with a dotting tool

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.580 
actually just did it with a dotting tool
which<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.850> mean<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:49.209> not<00:02:49.840> pretty<00:02:50.080> bad<00:02:50.320> i<00:02:50.350> mean

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
which I mean it's not pretty bad i mean

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190 
which I mean it's not pretty bad i mean
it<00:02:50.740> looks<00:02:50.860> cool<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.420> had<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.080> would

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
it looks cool but if I had this it would

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.040 
it looks cool but if I had this it would
have<00:02:53.290> been<00:02:53.410> much<00:02:53.709> more<00:02:53.770> easier<00:02:54.630> now<00:02:55.630> with<00:02:55.660> this

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
have been much more easier now with this

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.490 
have been much more easier now with this
I<00:02:56.320> can<00:02:56.380> probably<00:02:57.040> do<00:02:57.220> some<00:02:57.459> better<00:02:58.500> zebra

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
I can probably do some better zebra

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.860 
I can probably do some better zebra
stripes<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.370> stuff<00:03:00.610> because<00:03:00.760> when<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.720> would

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
stripes and stuff because when I would

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.500 
stripes and stuff because when I would
do<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.170> with<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.560> art<00:03:03.190> deco<00:03:03.640> ones<00:03:04.209> like

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
do it with the art deco ones like

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.180 
do it with the art deco ones like
they'll<00:03:04.959> be<00:03:05.110> kind<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.410> toothache<00:03:05.860> or

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
they'll be kind of toothache or

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.370 
they'll be kind of toothache or
somewhere<00:03:07.150> things<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.720> we're<00:03:07.840> thick<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:08.350> I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
somewhere things and we're thick so I

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.840 
somewhere things and we're thick so I
think<00:03:08.500> with<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.070> it'll<00:03:09.370> be<00:03:09.430> much<00:03:09.820> more

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
think with this it'll be much more

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.540 
think with this it'll be much more
intense<00:03:12.900> then<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.380> bought<00:03:14.890> myself<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.850> UV<00:03:16.600> lamp
