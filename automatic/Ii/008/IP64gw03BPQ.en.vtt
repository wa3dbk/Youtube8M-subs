00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
top and bottom margins um smaller that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.199 
top and bottom margins um smaller that
makes<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.769> makes<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.250> more<00:03:14.640> area<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.180> have

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.009 
overlapping each other um it's all I
usually<00:03:28.230> worry<00:03:28.350> about<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.750> make

ridiculously big on here the normal size
for<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.690> like<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.870> length<00:03:49.139> is<00:03:49.579> a<00:03:50.579> actually

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
for the like the length is a actually

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:00.069 
for the like the length is a actually
the<00:03:51.660> depth<00:03:51.980> quick<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.340> length<00:03:55.489> excuse<00:03:56.489> me<00:03:56.639> um

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.059 

it's<00:04:01.079> for<00:04:01.469> this<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:03.409> 687<00:04:04.409> millimeters

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
it's for this one it's 687 millimeters

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.429 
it's for this one it's 687 millimeters
which<00:04:05.999> is<00:04:06.239> about<00:04:07.430> 27<00:04:08.430> inches<00:04:09.290> which<00:04:10.290> i<00:04:10.379> think

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
which is about 27 inches which i think

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.849 
which is about 27 inches which i think
is<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.680> good<00:04:10.799> size<00:04:11.749> the<00:04:12.749> actual<00:04:13.109> assault<00:04:13.409> rifle

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
is a good size the actual assault rifle

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.659 
is a good size the actual assault rifle
is<00:04:14.099> supposedly<00:04:14.689> 34<00:04:15.689> inches<00:04:15.989> but<00:04:16.289> that<00:04:16.669> doesn't

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
is supposedly 34 inches but that doesn't

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.620 
is supposedly 34 inches but that doesn't
fit<00:04:17.880> on<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:19.199> paper<00:04:19.440> lyson<00:04:21.919> neatly<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.630> what

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
fit on the paper lyson neatly and what

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.890 
fit on the paper lyson neatly and what
the<00:04:24.870> scale<00:04:25.740> us<00:04:25.979> with<00:04:26.759> this<00:04:26.940> scale<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.389> fits

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
the scale us with this scale it fits

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.189 
the scale us with this scale it fits
nice<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.849> doesn't<00:04:29.849> go<00:04:30.180> over<00:04:30.449> top<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.900> paper

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
nice and doesn't go over top the paper

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.490 
nice and doesn't go over top the paper
so<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.340> makes<00:04:32.699> it<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.750> can<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.050> use

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
so it makes it so you can have to use

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.219 
so it makes it so you can have to use
the<00:04:34.710> divided<00:04:35.310> thing<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:36.419> cut<00:04:36.660> them<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:36.990> stuff

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
the divided thing to cut them and stuff

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.310 
the divided thing to cut them and stuff
and<00:04:37.620> put<00:04:37.800> them<00:04:37.889> at<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.009> curb<00:04:38.419> makes<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.570> saves

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
and put them at the curb makes it saves

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.219 
and put them at the curb makes it saves
time<00:04:40.470> for<00:04:40.919> when<00:04:41.039> you're<00:04:41.160> putting<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.430> together

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
time for when you're putting it together

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.689 
time for when you're putting it together
um<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.780> file<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.199> comes<00:04:46.440> with<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.650> clip<00:04:46.919> it
