00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the problem in the case of Constitution

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.090 
the problem in the case of Constitution
too<00:01:33.579> much<00:01:33.820> in<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.479> form<00:01:34.719> of<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:34.960> tsunami<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.829> the

case of calamen too little and that's

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.889
