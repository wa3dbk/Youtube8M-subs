00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
beginning I had a real big problem that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.160 
beginning I had a real big problem that
I<00:00:17.730> couldn't<00:00:18.119> find<00:00:18.300> any<00:00:18.510> screws<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.619> could

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170

accidentally<00:00:25.230> told<00:00:25.769> me<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.250> maybe<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.359> should

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
