a<00:00:38.730> tragic<00:00:39.149> accident<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.839> i'm<00:00:39.960> wondering<00:00:40.079> what

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
a tragic accident so i'm wondering what

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.649 
a tragic accident so i'm wondering what
would<00:00:41.159> make<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.730> lovely<00:00:41.940> ladies<00:00:42.179> decide

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
would make you two lovely ladies decide

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.689 
would make you two lovely ladies decide
to<00:00:42.780> step<00:00:42.989> behind<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.589> camera<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.159> start

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
to step behind the camera and start

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.939 
to step behind the camera and start
producing<00:00:44.909> events<00:00:45.480> well<00:00:45.929> i<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.409> just

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
producing events well i think just

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.649 
producing events well i think just
because<00:00:47.129> both<00:00:47.819> of<00:00:47.850> us<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.179> a<00:00:48.359> really

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
because both of us have a really

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.569 
because both of us have a really
business<00:00:49.019> oriented<00:00:49.499> background<00:00:50.010> i<00:00:50.280> think

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
business oriented background i think

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
business oriented background i think
that<00:00:50.699> we<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:50.819> both<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> take<00:00:51.569> charge

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that we just both like to take charge

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930 
that we just both like to take charge

look<00:01:49.110> twice<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.830> they're<00:01:50.010> not<00:01:50.130> sure<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
look twice and they're not sure and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.060 
look twice and they're not sure and
takes<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.870> little<00:01:51.990> bit<00:01:52.170> before<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.590> realize

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
takes a little bit before they realize

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.520 
takes a little bit before they realize
then<00:01:53.970> once<00:01:54.120> they<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.270> realize

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
then once they do realize

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.859 
then once they do realize
looking<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> girl<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:57.360> can't<00:01:57.600> are

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
looking right at the girl they can't are

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.250 
looking right at the girl they can't are
they<00:01:58.140> kept<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.650> transvestite<00:02:00.049> good<00:02:01.049> one

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
they kept like a transvestite good one

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.399 
they kept like a transvestite good one
though<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.760> don't<00:02:02.760> know<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.200> know<00:02:04.200> some

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
though I don't know what you know some

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.350 
though I don't know what you know some
of<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.590> simplest<00:02:04.920> stuff<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
of the simplest stuff is is really the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.570 
of the simplest stuff is is really the
hardest<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.740> time<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.979> painted<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> girl

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
hardest like one time I painted a girl

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.999 
hardest like one time I painted a girl
just<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:09.179> triangles<00:02:09.569> different<00:02:10.170> colors<00:02:10.560> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
just about triangles different colors it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.680 
just about triangles different colors it
took<00:02:11.160> forever<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> really<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
took forever because you really have to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.809 
took forever because you really have to
go<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.980> try<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.280> make<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.459> look<00:02:14.550> perfect

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
go in and try and make it look perfect

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.380 
go in and try and make it look perfect
but<00:02:15.330> stuff<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:17.390> flow

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
but stuff like this you can just flow

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.890 
but stuff like this you can just flow
through<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.870> brush<00:02:19.080> looks<00:02:20.069> impressive<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
through the brush looks impressive but I
