00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 if you are going to talk about ducklings you can 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.790
 easily make penis jokes I go 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.779
 just don't do it once because it is small 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.970
 is nice 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.970
 This is the Sony Xperia Z3 compact 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.450
 the sony xperia z3 compact is the small one 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.279
 brother of yes the sony xperia z3 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.560
 but unlike others 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.169
 smaller versions of large high-quality 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.079
 Telephones are the specifications 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.640
 just high and to mention there are 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.380
 save some things but where can you 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.690
 also immediately against ticking 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.910
 because it has a 4.7 inch screen and 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.920
 it is not full hd but just 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.899
 hd but you also have a small screen 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.219
 so you also have fewer pixels 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.140
 logical role further he has 120 flies 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.769
 hertz quad core snapdragon processor 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.359
 board 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.070
 and in combination with the 2 gigabytes on 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.870
 working memory should be smooth in countries 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.579
 and I can reassure you 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.589
 that is certainly the case 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.899
 the most basic apps are functional 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.850
 rap you go a little more graphic technical 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.769
 do things then we sometimes share it one 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.930
 falter a little but that is absolutely allowed 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.130
 have no name 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.070
 the quality of the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.409
 camera has a 20.7 megapixel sensor 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.880
 on board and with that you would in theory 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.010
 beautiful pictures can shoot well 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.230
 during the day that is absolutely the case 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.060
 but i like the evening and not always 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.380
 equally best and 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.180
 and I think this is especially strange 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 the white balance is often not right that is what it wants 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 say that there is generally one 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.210
 bit of a redundant boss about the picture 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.090
 shit that was also the case with the xperia 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.550
 z2 and this z3 compact is already suffering 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.770
 of 4k video with the love of the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.790
 background 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 and of course the old canal 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.750
 absolute plus of this phone 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.010
 the battery life has a battery capacity 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.300
 from 26 100 m ah if it is then also called and 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.770
 drove of course to do with the fact 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.570
 that it has a relatively small screen 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.880
 and not a full hd screen but an hd 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.310
 screen and that results in a telephone 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.380
 that easily lasts two days and that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.940
 is damn sometimes 5 can 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 we just have to talk about designing 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.840
 constant fact team naturally nice 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.300
 compact is back there 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 He also has a yes a transparent one 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.690
 Rand and I think you are there a bit 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.920
 of mourning 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.900
 I personally don't mind 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.280
 nice but my colleague paul gerssen 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.410
 spoke in our getty program 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.790
 bulging very positive about no I think 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.710
 it cool that I find cool 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.850
 you can opt for aluminum but it is that way 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.560
 not original that is that one 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 done sometime but I think there 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.180
 look tough so I think it's whole 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.920
 very in question of taste falls further 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.150
 on top of that the buttons are in the right place 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 sit that means that I am not with 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.750
 my finger has to play but me 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.010
 can operate everything immediately 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.300
 I really like that because 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.860
 a very common button nowadays 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.690
 up or all the way up to the top 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.700
 side and then I often have to press and 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 or I annoying thing is also really tasty 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.840
 light with 127 grams you just have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.250
 no idea that something has ebook bag 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.780
 and I really like that in the world 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.910
 where everything was but must and the ground and 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.590
 so small my boys wrote small 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.390
 I want to have it with you here 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.160
 about the operating system that is 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.900
 of course android 4 point four to that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.400
 know you all by now 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900
 and before I almost forget this one 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.459
 telephone is of course also one 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.220
 waterproof so if I want such a thing 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.940
 ladies and gentlemen i would put him in it so 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.940
 throw water 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.300
 nice though 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.550
 almost looking for a phone that doesn't 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.100
 too much and nice and compact 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.320
 anything you can want a phone 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.560
 then the xperia z3 compact is definitely something 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.560
 for you
