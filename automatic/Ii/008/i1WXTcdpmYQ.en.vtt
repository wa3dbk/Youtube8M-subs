the<00:01:40.770> control<00:01:41.100> settings<00:01:41.630> range<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:42.810> 1<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.290> 30

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.710 

the<00:01:46.649> titanium<00:01:46.979> seems<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.670> conduct<00:01:48.030> heat<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.509> lot

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the titanium seems to conduct heat a lot

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.660 
the titanium seems to conduct heat a lot
differently<00:01:49.140> than<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> ceramic<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.460> lot

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
differently than the ceramic it's a lot

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.710 
differently than the ceramic it's a lot
hotter<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> lot<00:01:51.750> hotter<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:53.360> with<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> turn

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
hotter it's a lot hotter so with a turn

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
hotter it's a lot hotter so with a turn
with<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> ceramic<00:01:55.619> iron<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.610> put<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
with the ceramic iron I have to put it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.550 
with the ceramic iron I have to put it
on<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:59.399> highest<00:01:59.610> setting<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.560> probably

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
on the highest setting this probably

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.450 
on the highest setting this probably
around<00:02:02.180> 2022<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> highest<00:02:04.140> 30<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.280> going

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
around 2022 at the highest 30 is going

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.010 
around 2022 at the highest 30 is going
to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.610> too<00:02:05.790> much<00:02:05.990> for<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.649> natural<00:02:07.799> hair<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
to be too much for my natural hair and I

just<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.180> little<00:02:22.300> bit<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.200> did<00:02:23.440> use<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.950> flat

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
just a little bit but I did use the flat

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.080 
just a little bit but I did use the flat
iron<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.760> side<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:27.220> actually<00:02:27.490> it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
iron on this side and I actually it

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.790 
iron on this side and I actually it
glided<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.230> well<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.870> plates<00:02:32.140> actually<00:02:32.410> moved

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
glided so well the plates actually moved

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.920 
glided so well the plates actually moved
themselves<00:02:33.430> as<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.850> see<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:40.570> was

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
themselves as you can see so I was

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.270 
themselves as you can see so I was
watching<00:02:41.350> another<00:02:41.440> review<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.010> they<00:02:42.070> said<00:02:42.220> it

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
watching another review and they said it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.220 
watching another review and they said it
was<00:02:42.400> kind<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.670> hard<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.240> glide<00:02:43.870> through<00:02:43.900> your

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
was kind of hard to glide through your

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.170 
was kind of hard to glide through your
hair<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:44.740> actually<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.640> me<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.790> wasn't

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
hair it's actually for me it wasn't

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.720 
hair it's actually for me it wasn't
don't<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.470> much<00:02:47.680> hair<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.610> know

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730

don't have that much hair but you know
it<00:02:48.940> wasn't<00:02:49.360> hard<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.260> glide<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:51.030> because<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
it wasn't hard to glide just because you

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.750 
it wasn't hard to glide just because you
adjust<00:02:52.900> your<00:02:52.990> pressure<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:54.220> adjust<00:02:54.700> your

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
adjust your pressure as you adjust your

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.280 
adjust your pressure as you adjust your
pressure<00:02:55.060> it'll<00:02:55.450> come<00:02:55.780> through<00:02:55.810> your<00:02:56.140> hair

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
pressure it'll come through your hair

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.440 
pressure it'll come through your hair

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I normally use on my hair and it's about

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.210 
I normally use on my hair and it's about
the<00:03:05.560> same<00:03:05.710> price<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:06.480> use<00:03:07.830> normally<00:03:08.830> use<00:03:08.980> this

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the same price I use normally use this

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.220 
the same price I use normally use this
this<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:10.410> andis<00:03:11.410> ceramic<00:03:12.310> iron<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:14.020> get<00:03:14.170> it

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
this is a andis ceramic iron you get it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.180 
this is a andis ceramic iron you get it
from<00:03:14.350> Walmart<00:03:14.550> Target<00:03:16.590> multi<00:03:17.590> heat<00:03:17.739> ceramic

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
from Walmart Target multi heat ceramic

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.850 
from Walmart Target multi heat ceramic
iron<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.850> ranges<00:03:19.270> from<00:03:19.480> 1<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.959> 20<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.560> think

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
iron and it ranges from 1 to 20 I think

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.210 
iron and it ranges from 1 to 20 I think
the<00:03:21.070> highest<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.550> gets<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.850> 420<00:03:22.780> degrees<00:03:23.220> as

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the highest this gets is 420 degrees as

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.560 
the highest this gets is 420 degrees as
you<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.520> see<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.300> ceramic<00:03:25.810> iron<00:03:26.020> plates

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
you can see it's the ceramic iron plates

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.760 
you can see it's the ceramic iron plates
don't<00:03:28.570> move<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:33.330> don't<00:03:34.330> if<00:03:35.050> you're<00:03:35.230> going<00:03:35.410> to
