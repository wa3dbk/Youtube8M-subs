introduction some the constructivist
architects<00:00:30.430> were<00:00:30.640> influenced<00:00:31.420> by<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:31.600> French

Derrida says when we deconstruct

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.350 
Derrida says when we deconstruct
anything<00:00:41.229> you<00:00:41.470> simply<00:00:42.070> do<00:00:42.280> not<00:00:42.430> destroy<00:00:43.059> or
