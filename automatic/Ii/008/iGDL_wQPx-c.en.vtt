00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.230 
from the point of yes I have seen the

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.480 
from the point of yes I have seen the
specs<00:07:14.530> I<00:07:14.710> haven't<00:07:14.950> actually<00:07:15.040> touch<00:07:15.460> the

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
specs I haven't actually touch the

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.610 
specs I haven't actually touch the
device<00:07:15.730> I'm<00:07:16.150> an<00:07:16.240> eldidd<00:07:16.600> haven't<00:07:17.140> reviewed<00:07:17.440> it

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
device I'm an eldidd haven't reviewed it

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.170 
device I'm an eldidd haven't reviewed it
and<00:07:17.770> I'm<00:07:18.070> sure<00:07:18.310> he<00:07:18.430> does<00:07:18.610> a<00:07:18.670> lot<00:07:18.910> of<00:07:18.970> great

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
and I'm sure he does a lot of great

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.550 
and I'm sure he does a lot of great
things<00:07:19.210> because<00:07:19.750> Apple<00:07:20.080> does<00:07:20.260> know<00:07:20.440> how<00:07:20.530> to

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
things because Apple does know how to

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.100 
things because Apple does know how to
make<00:07:20.800> very<00:07:21.040> solid<00:07:21.400> devices<00:07:21.820> but<00:07:22.360> in<00:07:22.630> terms<00:07:22.930> of

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
make very solid devices but in terms of

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.410 
make very solid devices but in terms of
differentiation<00:07:24.100> between<00:07:24.400> us<00:07:24.700> competitors<00:07:25.240> I

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.420 
differentiation between us competitors I

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.420 
differentiation between us competitors I
