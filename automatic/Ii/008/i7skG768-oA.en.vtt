00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.120
 Good day friend today we 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.359
 released the first series of gear cycle 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.000
 smarter together my name is max and in this 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.529
 series, I'll tell you about how they see the world 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.570
 animal living in a world of fuss and employment 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.220
 we do not even think that all we 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.579
 see and perceive with our eyes 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.050
 only people can appreciate and understand 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.600
 many animals don't even need 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 some colors or vice versa they can 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 see colors that we never 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 see it drastically changes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.360
 representations of their perception of the world and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.989
 This fact is at least unusual for us. 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.180
 close your eyes dark true you have it not 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.539
 scares her any moments you can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.329
 open and see everything but not blind and yes 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.760
 these guys don't survive they are blind from 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.010
 of birth and itâ€™s unlikely 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.799
 about this not particularly underground 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.290
 look by the way unlike moles 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.450
 Bird has a complete loss of vision and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 multiples only by very bad see very 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.430
 unusual is would Tales 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.710
 non-rectangular gas shape can 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.299
 look around 340 degrees 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.490
 without having to turn your head 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.250
 you love squid most likely just 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.689
 well cooked few know 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 that squid and are truly 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.549
 giant such a representative of his 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.400
 sort of like the colossal squid has 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.759
 only an eye with a diameter of 30 centimeters 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.619
 its length is between 10 and 14 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.210
 meters 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.100
 most squid distinguish colors in 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.620
 features red purple and yellow 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.050
 people of fish and reptiles and birds distinguish 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.240
 green and red but many 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.850
 mammals lack this ability 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.790
 she they just don't need it so 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.050
 that the process of development and survival 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.360
 dinosaurs who in turn because 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.160
 the structure of the circulatory system miley 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.020
 only awake in the warmth and at 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.810
 as night fell, they became lethargic and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.600
 sedentary primitive mammals 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.100
 went out to hunt at night and how do we know 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.780
 it is holy not to distinguish dogs at night 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.620
 distinguish between red orange and yellow 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.720
 shades 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.280
 but it sees ultraviolet and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.750
 distinguish biz org shades of gray 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.270
 cats because of the structure of their eyes 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.800
 has double light processing in cats 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.110
 there is a special extra layer 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.120
 luminous cells and falling on it 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.000
 faint twilight light reflected a 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.800
 then again hits the photoreceptor in 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.350
 bringing the intensity of it 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.750
 therefore, domestic cats and 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.950
 predators of the cat family moonlit nights and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.780
 I like the man a sunny day 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.130
 birds of prey such as the eagle can 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.820
 see your sacrifice from on high 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.680
 kilometers 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.540
 the most interesting thing they see and 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.670
 ultraviolet is due to the fact that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.260
 many animals mark territory with urine 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.810
 she unfortunately glow 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.209
 ultraviolet spectrum 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.050
 that in principle betrays their bird positions 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.410
 but the fish do see at 10-12 meters 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.430
 given separate categories are 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.769
 insects 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.870
 imagine that you see more than one 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.989
 picture and 10 examples 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.850
 unusually true and when these pictures 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.220
 thousands 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.260
 I was always surprised by these little ones 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.420
 creatures they themselves look like 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.020
 aliens still have frightening 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.850
 eyes on it and a huge plus thanks 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.560
 this example the fly sees in all 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.850
 directions that's why you are trying 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.120
 kill half a day 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.100
 chasing around the house yes and speed 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.970
 processing information from the eyes just 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.760
 phenomenal 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.050
 let's say films they would look at frames 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.540
 in the truest sense of the word but what 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.050
 concerns color not all insects see 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.000
 red but ultraviolet is available 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.630
 so nature has very few red 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 flowers 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.640
 neither can they focus sight 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.160
 on the object they see only the silhouette 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.920
 but this is more than offset by the reaction 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.940
 a huge overview around although it is very 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.070
 difficult to understand and if you draw a line under 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.140
 all we can safely say 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.870
 animals see what matters to them 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:31.040
 childhood tahiti paint on which they 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.590
 they hunt it what they eat on it all 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.750
