installing the game for you it may take

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.310 
installing the game for you it may take
up<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.620> another<00:04:28.220> hour<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:29.389> don't<00:04:30.050> know<00:04:30.169> it

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
up to another hour so I don't know it

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.220 
up to another hour so I don't know it
all<00:04:30.410> depends<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.520> says<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.690> will<00:04:32.900> take<00:04:33.110> an

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
all depends it says it it will take an

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.500 
all depends it says it it will take an
hour<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.530> 20<00:04:33.980> minutes<00:04:34.310> but<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:34.970> always<00:04:35.150> goes

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
hour and 20 minutes but that always goes

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.210 
hour and 20 minutes but that always goes
up<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:35.930> down<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.620> will<00:04:36.770> probably<00:04:36.950> take

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
up and down it will probably take

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.000 
up and down it will probably take
shorter<00:04:37.850> than<00:04:38.120> what<00:04:38.450> actually<00:04:38.720> says<00:04:39.290> so<00:04:39.770> you

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
shorter than what actually says so you

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.010 
shorter than what actually says so you
know<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:40.970> can<00:04:41.210> just<00:04:41.360> go<00:04:41.540> off<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.900> do

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
know you can just go off and do

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.780 
know you can just go off and do
something<00:04:42.470> when<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:42.800> come<00:04:42.980> back<00:04:43.160> go<00:04:43.340> or<00:04:43.550> be

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
something when you come back go or be

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.310 
something when you come back go or be
ready<00:04:44.060> for<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.720> then<00:04:44.930> once<00:04:45.139> that's
