00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.990 

so<00:01:09.430> this<00:01:09.640> shoe<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:11.530> actually<00:01:12.040> does<00:01:12.610> use<00:01:12.850> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
so this shoe it actually does use the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.070 
so this shoe it actually does use the
flywire<00:01:13.570> technology<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:14.619> there<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:16.420> uses<00:01:16.659> also

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
flywire technology on there it uses also

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.859 
flywire technology on there it uses also
the<00:01:17.200> hyperfuse<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.119> pretty<00:01:19.420> it's<00:01:19.780> a

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
the hyperfuse so it's pretty it's a

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.980 
the hyperfuse so it's pretty it's a
pretty<00:01:20.110> light<00:01:20.350> shoe<00:01:20.710> fairly<00:01:21.190> lights<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990
