00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
right here I am starting the conversion

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.180 
right here I am starting the conversion
process<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.720> didn't<00:02:57.110> have<00:02:57.320> nobody<00:02:57.890> showed

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
process and we didn't have nobody showed

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.770 
process and we didn't have nobody showed
us<00:02:58.280> how<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.060> we're<00:02:59.330> kind<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.690> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
us how to do this so we're kind of a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.600 
us how to do this so we're kind of a
little<00:02:59.959> lost<00:03:00.170> as<00:03:00.440> we're<00:03:00.830> trying<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.250> figure<00:03:01.550> it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
little lost as we're trying to figure it

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.300 
little lost as we're trying to figure it
out<00:03:01.730> yeah<00:03:02.270> so<00:03:02.959> basically<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.800> just<00:03:03.830> kick<00:03:04.130> that

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
out yeah so basically you just kick that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.340 
out yeah so basically you just kick that
in<00:03:04.520> drive<00:03:04.940> table<00:03:05.390> down<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.930> then<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.140> slide

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
in drive table down and then you slide

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.040 
in drive table down and then you slide
your<00:03:06.590> cushions<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.820> will<00:03:08.030> cover<00:03:08.239> somehow

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
your cushions on that will cover somehow

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.600 
your cushions on that will cover somehow
the<00:03:09.110> couch<00:03:09.350> slides<00:03:09.770> over<00:03:09.950> -<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.400> they<00:03:10.489> all

that<00:03:43.310> when<00:03:43.430> we<00:03:43.549> were<00:03:43.640> filming<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.470> and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
that when we were filming this and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.319 
that when we were filming this and
that's<00:03:45.890> right<00:03:46.160> if<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.579> weren't<00:03:46.790> careful<00:03:47.090> you

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
that's right if you weren't careful you

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.670 
that's right if you weren't careful you
could<00:03:47.480> rip<00:03:47.690> your<00:03:47.840> pants<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.380> thing<00:03:48.560> I

think<00:03:48.860> they<00:03:48.980> need<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.370> tweak<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:50.030> design<00:03:50.060> of

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
think they need to tweak the design of

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.370 
think they need to tweak the design of
that<00:03:50.570> some<00:03:51.019> yeah<00:03:52.299> okay<00:03:53.299> here's<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.930> main<00:03:54.110> bed

there<00:04:16.669> was<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.850> life

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
there was a life

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.180 
there was a life
all<00:04:17.690> right<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.680> don't<00:04:18.829> have<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.010> jump

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
all right so so you don't have to jump

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.830 
all right so so you don't have to jump
so<00:04:19.609> here<00:04:19.790> we<00:04:19.880> are<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.180> back<00:04:20.329> this<00:04:20.780> is
