00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
just going to play the first level here

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260 
just going to play the first level here
I'll<00:06:31.710> only<00:06:32.040> play<00:06:32.250> it<00:06:32.370> once<00:06:32.430> hopefully<00:06:33.120> I<00:06:33.150> don't

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
I'll only play it once hopefully I don't

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.290 
I'll only play it once hopefully I don't
die<00:06:33.570> it<00:06:33.840> can<00:06:34.350> get<00:06:34.620> quite<00:06:34.950> difficult<00:06:35.400> so

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
die it can get quite difficult so

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.170 
die it can get quite difficult so
basically<00:06:36.600> you're<00:06:36.930> this<00:06:37.080> ship<00:06:37.380> and<00:06:37.590> you<00:06:38.340> got

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
basically you're this ship and you got

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.760 
basically you're this ship and you got
to<00:06:39.270> avoid<00:06:39.480> a<00:06:39.540> bunch<00:06:39.810> of<00:06:39.870> flying<00:06:40.140> asteroids<00:06:40.650> it

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
to avoid a bunch of flying asteroids it

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.530 
to avoid a bunch of flying asteroids it
progressively<00:06:41.310> gets<00:06:41.580> harder<00:06:41.940> I'm<00:06:42.300> actually

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
progressively gets harder I'm actually

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.660 
progressively gets harder I'm actually
really<00:06:43.020> proud<00:06:43.230> of<00:06:43.290> the<00:06:43.800> level<00:06:44.190> generation

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
really proud of the level generation

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.820 
really proud of the level generation
system<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.210> created<00:06:45.300> for<00:06:45.840> this<00:06:46.050> in<00:06:46.260> such<00:06:46.800> a

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
system that I created for this in such a

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.560 
system that I created for this in such a
short<00:06:46.950> amount<00:06:47.640> of<00:06:47.790> time<00:06:47.850> it<00:06:48.210> worked<00:06:48.390> out<00:06:48.540> very

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
short amount of time it worked out very

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.440 
short amount of time it worked out very
well<00:06:49.400> I'm<00:06:50.400> actually<00:06:50.610> getting<00:06:50.940> a<00:06:51.120> really

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
well I'm actually getting a really

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.420 
well I'm actually getting a really
really<00:06:51.870> easy<00:06:52.140> level<00:06:52.530> here<00:06:52.830> usually<00:06:53.040> it's<00:06:53.370> not

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
really easy level here usually it's not

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.870 
really easy level here usually it's not
this<00:06:53.700> easy<00:06:54.500> wow<00:06:55.500> I'm<00:06:55.710> lucky<00:06:56.010> this<00:06:56.160> time<00:06:56.220> as<00:06:56.670> you

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
can see I have made it far enough I

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.080 
can see I have made it far enough I
traveled<00:06:58.830> enough<00:06:59.040> distance<00:06:59.280> so<00:06:59.580> I<00:06:59.700> made<00:06:59.940> it<00:06:59.970> to

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
traveled enough distance so I made it to

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.090 
traveled enough distance so I made it to
the<00:07:00.270> other<00:07:00.360> planet<00:07:00.840> i<00:07:00.990> an't<00:07:01.470> earned<00:07:01.740> a<00:07:01.919> few

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
the other planet i an't earned a few

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.719 
the other planet i an't earned a few
parts<00:07:02.490> and<00:07:02.730> I'm<00:07:03.419> back<00:07:03.690> at<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:03.930> map<00:07:04.140> now<00:07:04.169> I'm<00:07:04.530> at

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729 
parts and I'm back at the map now I'm at

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.299 
parts and I'm back at the map now I'm at
this<00:07:04.849> planet<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:06.229> I<00:07:06.379> still<00:07:06.650> can't<00:07:06.889> go<00:07:07.039> here

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:07.309 
this planet and I still can't go here

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:08.709 
this planet and I still can't go here
because<00:07:07.610> I<00:07:07.639> don't<00:07:07.939> have<00:07:08.029> enough<00:07:08.240> distance<00:07:08.479> to

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:08.719 
because I don't have enough distance to

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.390 
because I don't have enough distance to
travel<00:07:08.990> I'll<00:07:09.379> have<00:07:09.589> to<00:07:09.710> upgrade<00:07:10.009> that<00:07:10.129> later
