as you can see it's not like as good as
the<00:04:04.409> other<00:04:05.099> ones<00:04:05.430> are<00:04:05.840> because<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.459> did<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
the other ones are because I did the

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.949 
the other ones are because I did the
other<00:04:08.639> ones<00:04:08.969> differently<00:04:09.359> like<00:04:09.479> this<00:04:09.659> one<00:04:09.810> is

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
other ones differently like this one is

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.259 
other ones differently like this one is
just<00:04:10.199> cheetah<00:04:10.650> kisses<00:04:11.009> on<00:04:11.189> the<00:04:11.219> inside<00:04:12.060> and

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
just cheetah kisses on the inside and

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.479 
just cheetah kisses on the inside and
the<00:04:12.389> out<00:04:12.539> but<00:04:13.259> on<00:04:13.409> my<00:04:13.620> newer<00:04:13.829> ones<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.310> used

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
the out but on my newer ones I used

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.459 
the out but on my newer ones I used
chrome<00:04:14.819> on<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.209> inside<00:04:15.509> because<00:04:15.689> it<00:04:15.840> helps<00:04:16.199> to

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:16.469 
chrome on the inside because it helps to

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.289 
chrome on the inside because it helps to
form<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.949> bow<00:04:17.159> better<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:17.849> that's<00:04:17.969> the<00:04:18.150> first

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
form the bow better so that's the first

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.439 
form the bow better so that's the first
one<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.829> there's<00:04:20.279> this<00:04:20.430> one<00:04:20.699> I'm<00:04:21.120> going

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449
