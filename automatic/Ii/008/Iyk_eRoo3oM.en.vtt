00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.380
 just a very moisturizing bb king me 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.269
 I also use the same line 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:40.899
 the moisturizer just the night face cream 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:43.600
 and day and I am fine I am super 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.829

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.390
 brush this from new york knicks the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.390
 export face brush 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.699
 of course he used the clear 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.409
 light is the thing you immediately feel 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.170
 but you make it look like an effect 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.140
 wet skin as soon as you go to roll it out 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 feel the effect of when you are 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.630
 wet with the water which then goes 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.899
 vanish as soon as you roll it out now 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.610
 after passing the lab id game on 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.000
 all notice we pass to the trick of the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.070
 eyes 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 let's start by applying a base on all 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.100
 the eyelid of this kale bomb 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 anti aging and I really put it 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.300
 very little because this is the quantity 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.130
 that serves I put it on the whole eyelid 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.800
 and now the protagonist of this trick 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.700
 that this wonderful little wall then 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:50.110
 he began by applying this precisely 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.979
 coppery I take a little and apply it on 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.979
 all the eyelid 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.530
 with the brush to fade and I take 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.350
 this color is the most brown 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.380
 clear that the dark brown and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.720
 it should then be close to gray 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.040
 there the texas I take it so tip 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.130
 widow to be applied in the fold 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.130
 eye 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.650
 now that same brush I take the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.800
 darker darker brown color than 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.460
 including 12 opening up this way 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.150
 really very little and I put it in the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.930
 eye bend just to give 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.700
 angled brush depth 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.830
 we always press the brown one the most 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.400
 dark we just used take 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.310
 so of point and we are going to apply it 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.820
 under the lower lashes surrounding 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.820
 the whole eye 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.269
 now let's try this new together 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.609
 eyeliner that debora and is called 3 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:06.790
 type notre tip eyeliner and it is precisely lay 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:10.269
 line the one with the three tips you are able to 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 see this now but fire every time 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.530
 it is a lottery 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.959
 who knows if the only one in focus I ever have 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.689
 used so I have not the slightest idea of 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.329
 how to use it I've always seen it 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.670
 always seen and never used it 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.689
 finally it can be done so you see it 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:33.129
 three lines can be tapped to create 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:36.250
 the eyeliner well and 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.900
 facilitate then is united perhaps not 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.040
 precisely it can be used 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.470
 normally so we try it 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.010
 let's try it together then create the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.709
 our eyeliner line let's see some 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.970
 enter the mirror yes here it is 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.970
 let's see how it works 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.910
 no I would say that I don't lash them so much 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.370
 long and thick big than the three tips 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.280
 they fit inside your eyelashes and don't 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.230
 the precise line knows I should pull 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.230
 the eye which I do not like 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.070
 no I would say that I am not able to use 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.790
 in order not to spoil everything, it seems 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.139
 from fassino it is not for me but I would like to do 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.200
 a little practice and I take mine 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.020
 beloved what is there that is losing blue 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.970
 I take my beloved eyeliner say 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.419
 funds and try to remedy this 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.419
 damage 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.430
 my lines came straight as 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.930
 of the tracks of a thousand those that make of 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.999
 what you do what you do 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.749

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:07.050
 anyway it's okay not to worry 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:09.479
 because then with the mascara we will go to 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.550
 equalize a little all because the mascara 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.610
 precisely it hides all the defects 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.860
 the lines are not exactly straight that 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:22.710
 that we make the point on the eyes though 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.259
 before applying the mascara with the 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.580
