going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.740> extremely<00:01:41.549> long<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
going to be extremely long you know you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.020 
going to be extremely long you know you
go<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.200> having<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.680> 40<00:01:44.189> minute<00:01:44.399> workout<00:01:44.850> when

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
with the same amount of sets the only

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
with the same amount of sets the only
difference<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:50.490> lifting<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.390> more

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600

that muscle you know nutrition is the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
that muscle you know nutrition is the
you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.820> calorie<00:01:57.390> surplus<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.020> will

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you know calorie surplus is what will
