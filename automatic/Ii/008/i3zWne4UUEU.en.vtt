 imagine are a few years I have 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.009
 than having a creator of the idea of 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.719
 do what 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.389
 imagine that the whole world and Scotland 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:24.310
 what they use to handle their whiskeys or 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.200
 their rums they use 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.230
 barrels that were used to arrive 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.490
 drinking whiskey from kentucky would not be more 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.580
 easy because they do not have to be 100 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.100
 years much easier and much cheaper 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.910
 the cost of the barrel will be between 100 and 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.700
 150 the cost of the Spanish barrel has 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.670
 come with xerez is going to be between 1000 and 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.320
 1500 has a quality that is not what 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.230
 you can imagine 100 years to wait 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.750
 that the trees are there 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.650

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.920

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.420
 represent kraftwerk Dominicans and that 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.550
 prove it has been known if you do not 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.350
 they have proven I am woman to me I still 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.940
 it was a little burning the throat 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.610
 but I think it's normal not then it's going 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.170
 I think it's a flavor that has to 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.140
 get what to go find it 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.750

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.660
 I do not really know rum and I like it 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.070
 the rum I'm passionate about whiskey 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.500
 especially from Scotland because it has 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.140
 more flavor and this is a mixture of in 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.260
 actually two countries that have joined 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:29.880
