00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.549
 Tell me, how are you? I'm Gustavo. 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.380
 gusmÃ£o and start now but the infolab 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.270
 Answer, I'm in the studio here. 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.820
 on these white walls 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.130
 wonderful here as novels by 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.220
 of people have spoken today about a 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.630
 question that the no of a question was 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.430
 a comet inspired in it that there is 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.520
 controversy that started the comments 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.610
 in the latest videos about cameras 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.530
 they survived exactly they argued over 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.379
 the quality of the cameras or were 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.359
 or crisis by the network and we saw david 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.839
 He pulled out the question what makes the final 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.899
 with a camera being good so yes it is good 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.300
 heated big issue there is a 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.940
 camera is not only image quality if 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.339
 How is it in Saints and Oakland? 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.859
 commenting on the number 20 is very special 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.800
 because it has a sensor even that 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.329
 based on the theorem of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.309
 nigris that is something that, moreover, people 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.340
 you can explore a video to the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.090
 front if you are interested more 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.490
 finally 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.050
 r has a sensor that makes listening always 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.350
 to create an image quality 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.780
 superior in fact to even more things 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.610
 Today in most current day 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.680
 only it is not only that to do one thing 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.080
 good, especially when you are 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.180
 trying a smartphone for example I can 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.340
 To say that it made the anc makes a beautiful 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.230
 digital beck 80 megapixel is the best 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.600
 camera but inherited a digital camera 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.520
 beck for example to your grandmother using the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.270
 smartphone it will not be nor who it is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:43.040
 who did not vote but anyway the question is that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.510
 the smartphone it has to be fast and 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.580
 He has to be must have a camera. 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.440
 appropriate by the medium the fact is that the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.850
 number 20 despite having something 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.680
 thing 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.180
 very high image to people by 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 long considered the best camera 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.520
 and it is fact is that it is slow it takes 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.650
 to open the camera the system 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.759
 autofocus because the set of 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.330
 lenses is bigger 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.430
 this is a physical need is he is 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.470
 more complicated to operate and takes longer 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.020
 to take photo spend more energy has 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.900
 a number of issues there then so 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.790
 that we consistently take for granted 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.239
 example for the iphone is a camera here 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.519
 it has 8 megapixels and comes out of your type 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.470
 front one before simply take photo 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.310
 in that situation he ends up taking notes 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.310
 high 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.140
 I will not do it at the time it is 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.269
 best for the gender issue spears 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.670
 there is not exactly several issues there 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.620
 the application itself as it handles 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.720
 that and in addition to this people who 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.010
 said this from the brand that is the flight o 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.780
 reference group for tests in the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.269
 camera industry and said that it is better 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.590
 16 beautiful smartphone camera the beautiful 16 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.650
 agrees crosses 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.750
 then's there're a camera is not made only 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.660
 image quality has other 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.540
 issues the jump but not on the issue of 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.250
 1933 deceit defended so staunchly to 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.360
 Lady, yes, I know he has a 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.150
 cool camera has a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.280
 I think your club has the exact dollar 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.320
 nokia is one thing we need 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.340
 understand that it foresees applies to several 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.290
 do not run 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 the preview it is bali emerged as the euro 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.620
 lost 808 which was a Symbian cell phone from 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.079
 nokia 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.760
 before the duel still in how 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.190
 concomitant with the development of 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.530
 windows phone it was a cell phone in this 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.510
 first edict is there that arose per 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.840
 view with this question of seeing you always 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.160
 only later that night when I started to 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.530
 put stabilization system of 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.750
 image on old cameras but fans 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.359
 common in always hearing nothing too 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.510
 started to use the preview participated is 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.970
 a little of the prestige that 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.840
 had camera of 808 and Sunday 20 and 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.579
 then it is over 930 and I have only lost 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.200
 because it only has a pv name because of a 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.630
 image stabilization system 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.820
 he is good he is 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.170
 good at the time was one of the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.910
 12 first pioneer seconds is just that 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.370
 this does not mean that the market does not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.540
 went ahead the system of 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.360
 image stabilization is something that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.370
 is becoming a means which is the 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.220
 standard in the standard of proposing 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.270
 the most advanced is g 4 itself 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.170
 has a system of stabilization of 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.340
 image that has a shaft more than the dodo 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.630
 932 of the general average 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.640
 so it's a pretty good cjf noise not 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.600
 it means that it is better the market 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.760
 do not go forward 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.100
 the development government we will see 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.500
 to the next and the panic is put 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.180
 on the table then everything from number 21 on 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.180
 emergence gains in image quality 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.350
 Pure and took the photo will only get photo 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.990
 number 20 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.240
 or win where there was 6 wins in the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.460
 Overall it is faster than 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.020
 use the files are easier to 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.490
 deal because they are smaller 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.260
 is it more intuitive then have it 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.040
 so it has a more general note 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.380
 high was 616 so offer 6 is s 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.410
 similar to here is a little lower 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.390
 understand, this is it, I hope so 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.070
 that the video has been answered and 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.810
 Please, the film is here. 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.000
 monitoring old people that my side is 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.350
 behind the cameras still the whole studio 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.350
 Sir, even more business.
