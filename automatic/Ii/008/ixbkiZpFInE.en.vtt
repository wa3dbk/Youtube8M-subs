00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
it will be and what would be an

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.660 
it will be and what would be an
acceptable<00:00:46.320> solution<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> personally

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
acceptable solution for you personally

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.480 
acceptable solution for you personally
to<00:00:48.240> begin<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.290> think<00:00:49.740> we<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> safely<00:00:50.250> make

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
to begin with I think we can safely make

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.760 
to begin with I think we can safely make
one<00:00:50.790> statement<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.720> auction<00:00:52.050> house<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.530> here

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
one statement the auction house is here

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.980 
one statement the auction house is here
to<00:00:52.800> stay<00:00:53.130> and<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.640> some<00:00:53.850> form<00:00:54.150> it<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.780> part

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
to stay and in some form it will be part

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.680 
to stay and in some form it will be part
of<00:00:55.110> PvP<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.830> well<00:00:56.040> simply<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.390> business

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
of PvP as well simply from a business

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.960 
of PvP as well simply from a business
perspective<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.740> makes<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.280> lot<00:00:59.490> of<00:00:59.520> sense<00:00:59.880> to

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
perspective it makes a lot of sense to

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.210 
perspective it makes a lot of sense to
cater<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> Diablo<00:01:01.410> enthusiasts

cater for all the Diablo enthusiasts

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.219 
cater for all the Diablo enthusiasts
including<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.090> ones<00:01:03.300> who<00:01:03.450> have<00:01:03.810> more<00:01:04.049> money

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
including the ones who have more money

including the ones who have more money
than<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.860> their<00:01:05.040> hands

although<00:01:06.060> buying<00:01:06.300> power<00:01:06.630> completely

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
although buying power completely

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.260 
although buying power completely
destroys<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.980> feel<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.310> accomplishment<00:01:09.090> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
destroys the feel of accomplishment in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
destroys the feel of accomplishment in
any<00:01:09.510> form<00:01:09.870> I'm<00:01:10.020> sure<00:01:10.440> many<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.040> tempted

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
any form I'm sure many will be tempted

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.910 
any form I'm sure many will be tempted
to<00:01:11.550> upgrade<00:01:12.000> after<00:01:12.240> getting<00:01:12.870> owned<00:01:13.140> again<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to upgrade after getting owned again and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.250 
to upgrade after getting owned again and
again<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:15.090> idea<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.050> have<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
again my idea is that we have to

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.469 
again my idea is that we have to
separate<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:16.920> crowns<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.760> way<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
separate the two crowns in some way so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
separate the two crowns in some way so
everyone<00:01:18.930> gets<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.800> want<00:01:20.010> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
everyone gets what they really want I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.790 
everyone gets what they really want I
have<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.909> two<00:01:21.150> main<00:01:21.330> ideas<00:01:21.510> first<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> all

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
have here two main ideas first of all

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.010 
have here two main ideas first of all
there<00:01:23.130> could<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.370> two<00:01:23.670> separate<00:01:24.030> PvP<00:01:24.510> systems

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
there could be two separate PvP systems

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
there could be two separate PvP systems
with<00:01:25.290> separate<00:01:25.680> ladders<00:01:26.010> there<00:01:26.550> could<00:01:26.760> be

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
with separate ladders there could be

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600 
with separate ladders there could be
soft<00:01:27.300> EVP<00:01:27.870> that<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.380> paid<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> win<00:01:29.010> and<00:01:29.250> has

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
soft EVP that is paid to win and has

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
soft EVP that is paid to win and has
unlimited<00:01:29.940> access<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> auction<00:01:30.900> house

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
unlimited access to the auction house

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
unlimited access to the auction house
then<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:32.340> could<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.549> real<00:01:33.060> PvP<00:01:33.659> with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
then there could be real PvP with

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
then there could be real PvP with
absolutely<00:01:34.470> zero<00:01:34.830> access<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> auction

absolutely zero access to the auction

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.450 
absolutely zero access to the auction

could<00:01:38.640> only<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:38.909> items<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.690> found<00:01:39.960> yourself

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
could only use items you found yourself

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.110 
could only use items you found yourself
thus<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> game<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.549> take<00:01:41.940> into

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
thus the game would not take into

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.090 
thus the game would not take into
consideration<00:01:42.210> any<00:01:43.049> gear<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.830> bought

would<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.100> soft<00:01:47.340> PvP<00:01:47.880> would<00:01:48.090> also<00:01:48.330> act<00:01:48.659> as

would be that soft PvP would also act as

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.930 
would be that soft PvP would also act as

a test run for real PvP and you could

would be that this solution would put
