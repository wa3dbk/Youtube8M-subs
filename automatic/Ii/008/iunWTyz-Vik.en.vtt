drive out you got the two clips here

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.319 
drive out you got the two clips here
then<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.570> pull<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.730> pull<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> cords

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.260 

don't<00:01:22.110> really<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> take<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.939> cuz<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
don't really want to take it out cuz you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
don't really want to take it out cuz you
gotta<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> screws<00:01:25.110> out

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
gotta take the screws out

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:37.340 
gotta take the screws out
um<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:29.220> thin<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
um and it's really thin and then you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.149 
um and it's really thin and then you
take<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.400> RAM<00:01:38.700> mount<00:01:38.970> which<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.780> here

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
take the RAM mount which is right here

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.450 
take the RAM mount which is right here
um<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.390> 2<00:01:43.079> gigabytes<00:01:43.619> each<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.310> it's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
um I think it's 2 gigabytes each so it's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.969 
um I think it's 2 gigabytes each so it's
4<00:01:44.729> gigabytes<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:46.490> in<00:01:47.490> under<00:01:48.119> here

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
4 gigabytes and the in under here

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.710 
4 gigabytes and the in under here
there's<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:51.170> processor<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:53.729> need<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.479> already

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
there's the processor you need I already

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.969 
there's the processor you need I already
take<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.079> out<00:01:55.290> um<00:01:57.710> over<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.329> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.540> add

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
take that out um over here you can add

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.300 
take that out um over here you can add
more<00:02:01.979> cards<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.390> um<00:02:03.860> video<00:02:04.860> cards<00:02:05.250> and

blue lever here up the side comes up and
you<00:02:13.000> take<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.450> out<00:02:14.549> which<00:02:15.549> go<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:16.150> here<00:02:22.650> um

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you take these out which go in here um

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:36.020 
you take these out which go in here um
it's<00:02:28.019> got<00:02:30.690> Windows<00:02:33.030> XP<00:02:34.030> Media<00:02:34.959> Center<00:02:35.230> Edition

port the Ethernet VGA off online um

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.509 
port the Ethernet VGA off online um
the<00:03:12.150> digital<00:03:13.150> auxilary<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.989> think<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:15.220> then

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
the digital auxilary I think and then

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.559 
the digital auxilary I think and then
all<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.769> microphone<00:03:17.769> speaker<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:20.370> plug-in

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
all the microphone speaker the plug-in

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.670 
all the microphone speaker the plug-in
it's<00:03:22.569> set<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:23.019> all<00:03:24.419> 115<00:03:25.419> volts<00:03:25.989> right<00:03:26.319> now<00:03:26.470> and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
it's set to all 115 volts right now and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.550 
it's set to all 115 volts right now and
then<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.889> can<00:03:27.040> switch<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.400> 230<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:35.200> then

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
then you can switch it to 230 and then

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.360 
then you can switch it to 230 and then
on<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.099> front<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.720> hold<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.620> one<00:03:38.859> second

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
on the front here hold on one second

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.979 
on the front here hold on one second
they<00:03:39.489> tilt<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.120> camera<00:03:40.389> up<00:03:40.599> on<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.660> front

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
they tilt the camera up on the front

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.930 
they tilt the camera up on the front
here<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:45.299> have<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.489> actually<00:03:51.819> the
