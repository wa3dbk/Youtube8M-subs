00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 will get the 6.1 long-awaited pet pet 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.000
 6.1 that will make spending money 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.150
 new to play again and that will 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.160
 include quite a lot in fact the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 Huge competition bikes but if they were 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 for who does not play 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.750
 I think it's important but there the new 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.779
 model of the blood two blood elves 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 elf that in fact they had reformed 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.760
 every year last year they had not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.759
 released the new chart template of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.270
 all the characters - from the blood elf and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.690
 Then it's going to leave now, and it's going to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.340
 exit the new inheritance train system 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.710
 a lot that will have the update 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.360
 inside the game you still know the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.120
 interface they will change some things 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.649
 and you will also enter a mode of the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.719
 Game for who is colorblind who has this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.370
 that I've been upset because it has 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 quite a lot of people who are already colorblind 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.559
 they made a completely 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 different you can configure from 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 according to the stamp of 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 because there are several types of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 different color and then you set 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.040
 and also because there were some problems 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 This is because, for example, the level of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.610
 reality of the item 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 he was different he is differentiated by 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.159
 for example would be orange if 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 know he's legendary purple there is more 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.890
 rare and normal for example and gray is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.530
 who does not take how I could 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.619
 differentiate this level of reality from 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.409
 item a person never and never know huh 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.020
 so with that now they will be 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.720
 writing if the level of reality of the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.329
 item on the item also has that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 character hpp question by 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.350
 example for you to know if it is yours 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.350
 friend would be your enemy or if he is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.439
 neutral was differentiated by color then 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.340
 your friends were green the enemies were 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.340
 is at 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.420
 the gaucho champion 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.860
 Are you artur colorblind? 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.020
 I always suspected neutral plans 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.600
 enemies were red and neutrals are 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.170
 in yellow as one would know 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.230
 that she can pay that she is a post and even 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.840
 A little thank you, understood all 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.510
 make the person the person can play 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.910
 but it will be much easier now 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.070
 give a very large and not very easy 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.230
 reflect our but it will have so much 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.170
 people so play is the acrefi 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.330
 and I went into the news of the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.430
 Brazilian forum for everyone to be 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.920
 Wow, I'm finally going to be able to play 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.150
 now there's a version for me now I 'm going 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.970
 to make the networks 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.300
 so it seems it seems to have 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.350
 enough people who are color blind then 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 say that there are 12 left in the game even though 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.980
 need not be quoting that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.320
 they are for anyone who plays the same of ias 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.130
 News 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.019
 The bug is now practically this. 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.959
 So who wants to check the notes 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.720
 of the pet goes there at the craft site they have 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.920
 a huge list of text that you can 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.580
 read 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.269
 otherwise it will be available now 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.269
