00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
we've seen him drop into coverage a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.560 
we've seen him drop into coverage a
little<00:00:38.230> bit<00:00:38.350> like<00:00:38.949> as<00:00:39.850> an<00:00:40.059> offensive<00:00:40.360> lineman

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
little bit like as an offensive lineman

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.770 
little bit like as an offensive lineman
how<00:00:41.379> I<00:00:41.410> guess<00:00:41.909> just<00:00:42.909> that<00:00:43.150> kind<00:00:43.449> of<00:00:43.510> throw<00:00:43.720> you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
how I guess just that kind of throw you

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.240 
how I guess just that kind of throw you
off<00:00:43.989> your<00:00:44.019> game<00:00:44.199> a<00:00:44.350> little<00:00:44.470> bit<00:00:44.680> ly<00:00:44.860> see<00:00:45.070> that

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
off your game a little bit ly see that

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.460 
off your game a little bit ly see that
I'm<00:00:45.820> supposed<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.089> go<00:00:46.210> get<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.510> guy<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.049> now

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
guys coming okay I guess is it just

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:56.369 
guys coming okay I guess is it just
gives<00:00:55.479> you<00:00:55.570> another<00:00:55.750> thing<00:00:55.839> I<00:00:56.019> think<00:00:56.229> about

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
gives you another thing I think about

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.390 
gives you another thing I think about
though<00:00:56.589> yeah<00:00:57.989> before<00:00:58.989> this<00:00:59.559> spring<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.250> you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
though yeah before this spring and you

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.770 
though yeah before this spring and you
ever<00:01:00.549> you<00:01:00.850> ever<00:01:00.879> really<00:01:01.210> taken<00:01:01.540> snaps

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
ever you ever really taken snaps

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.160 
ever you ever really taken snaps
whatever<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.260> before<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:03.339> Center<00:01:05.400> no<00:01:06.400> I<00:01:06.610> have

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
whatever it before that Center no I have

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.840 
whatever it before that Center no I have
is<00:01:08.170> there<00:01:08.409> an<00:01:08.619> adjustment<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.400> be<00:01:09.640> made<00:01:09.820> there

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
is there an adjustment to be made there

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.969 
is there an adjustment to be made there
is<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.360> easier<00:01:10.659> once<00:01:10.869> he's<00:01:11.049> settled<00:01:11.290> into<00:01:11.619> no<00:01:11.950> I

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
is it easier once he's settled into no I

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.560 
is it easier once he's settled into no I
mean<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.340> guess<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.610> was<00:01:12.729> just<00:01:12.909> taken<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.450> lot<00:01:13.509> of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
mean I guess it was just taken a lot of

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.300 
mean I guess it was just taken a lot of
number<00:01:13.899> one<00:01:14.020> snaps<00:01:14.320> but<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.710> there<00:01:14.829> any<00:01:15.009> kind

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
number one snaps but is there any kind

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.279 
number one snaps but is there any kind
of<00:01:15.429> chemistry<00:01:16.329> you<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.840> develop<00:01:16.960> with

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
of chemistry you have to develop with

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.539 
of chemistry you have to develop with
your<00:01:17.409> quarterback<00:01:17.799> I've<00:01:18.009> Center<00:01:18.310> yeah<00:01:18.490> you

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
your quarterback I've Center yeah you

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.010 
your quarterback I've Center yeah you
always<00:01:18.729> got<00:01:18.939> a<00:01:18.969> developed<00:01:19.270> country<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.780> think

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
always got a developed country I think

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.959 
always got a developed country I think
we've<00:01:20.109> done<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.259> really<00:01:20.409> good<00:01:20.560> job<00:01:20.729> via<00:01:21.729> the

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
we've done a really good job via the

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.270 
we've done a really good job via the
hybrid<00:01:22.329> I<00:01:22.450> just<00:01:23.049> got<00:01:23.289> developing<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.799> know<00:01:24.070> we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
hybrid I just got developing you know we

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.370 
hybrid I just got developing you know we
would<00:01:24.460> joke<00:01:24.640> around<00:01:24.789> a<00:01:24.909> lot

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
would joke around a lot

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
would joke around a lot

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
down when did that start to build

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.050 
down when did that start to build
definitely<00:01:30.539> this<00:01:30.719> camp<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.770> sure<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.490> what

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
definitely this camp for sure so what

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
definitely this camp for sure so what
was<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.420> something<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.930> stands<00:01:34.470> out

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
was there something that stands out

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609

about that relationship or makes you say
this<00:01:37.799> camp<00:01:38.039> was<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.490> Saturday<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.570> we

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
this camp was one of Saturday I think we

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.080 
this camp was one of Saturday I think we
just<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.350> trusting<00:01:40.799> each<00:01:40.860> other<00:01:41.039> no<00:01:41.820> he's<00:01:41.970> at

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just have trusting each other no he's at

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
just have trusting each other no he's at
his<00:01:42.360> job<00:01:42.539> done<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.929> I'm<00:01:43.409> gonna<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> ball
