 we had done everything in the Netherlands 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.190
 we could do there and very much 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.029

 We also have Chris and Lisan and the surrounding area 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.360

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.590
 we must go there and we must 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.910
 her to go get speaking manner and thus 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.400

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.080

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.720
 of van of specialized men 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.619

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.080
 yes that feels very good and I am convinced 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.050
 convinced that everything is closet 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.970
 met by the authorities here ours 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.220
 to be found 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.729
 there are all kinds of rumors in the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.170
 bypass 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.729
 what do you think yes no that 's what 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.979
 I think most of them are comfortable there 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.340
 don't explore until next 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.100
 all of them 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.149
 what is said about it then what you 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.579
 is what people are going to speculate 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.109
 about what could have happened and 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.530
 what did what that and 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.729
 people go small pieces of information 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.649
 connecting them together may not be useful 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.909
 have to do with each other and there one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.009
 story because everyone 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.060
 trying to find a solution 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.219
 so yes what i follow what i follow is true what 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.700
 just say the authorities and and where us 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.350
 facts is certain to that in particular 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.640
 to follow and figure out and what that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.829
 this also includes all scenarios 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 kept open and attention everywhere 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.340
 spent on it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 what are actually for me 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.709
 the world travelers number so much risk 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.360
 no this is certainly not much 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.360
 risks and responsible mine and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.010
 sensible girls who know what psyche 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.049
 they do well and have considered 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.150
 where she would like to go and where she would like 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.739
 of want would want to do the same 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.859
 it is booked through organization 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.469
 so in itself everything was arranged and 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.329
 Little could go wrong but apparently 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.889
 so something went wrong and different 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.980
 then we weren't there for a week 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.980
