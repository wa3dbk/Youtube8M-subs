you<00:04:42.360> can't<00:04:42.630> kill<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.110> if<00:04:43.380> your<00:04:43.830> range<00:04:44.100> is

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
you can't kill this if your range is

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.400 
you can't kill this if your range is
pretty<00:04:44.580> low<00:04:44.729> because<00:04:45.360> if<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.720> see<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.200> this

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
pretty low because if you see in this

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.250 
pretty low because if you see in this
area<00:04:46.830> here<00:04:47.190> there<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.639> time<00:04:48.060> limit<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.570> think

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
area here there is a time limit I think

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.800 
area here there is a time limit I think
it's<00:04:49.440> only<00:04:49.620> like<00:04:50.040> two<00:04:50.820> minutes<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.300> believe<00:04:51.330> for

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
it's only like two minutes I believe for

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.860 
it's only like two minutes I believe for
the<00:04:51.840> Leviathan<00:04:52.350> or<00:04:52.740> three<00:04:53.250> minutes<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.870> really

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
the Leviathan or three minutes I really

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.530 
the Leviathan or three minutes I really
want<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.080> say<00:04:55.200> Leviathan<00:04:56.180> yeah<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.360> one's

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
one is maybe it's the exact same but a

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.000 
one is maybe it's the exact same but a
different<00:05:01.320> color<00:05:01.470> who<00:05:01.950> knows<00:05:03.889> dude<00:05:04.889> oh<00:05:04.979> dude

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010

oh<00:05:05.580> my<00:05:06.000> god<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.289> is<00:05:07.590> oh<00:05:07.919> this<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:08.970> the

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
oh my god and this is oh this is the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.659 
oh my god and this is oh this is the
same<00:05:09.539> boss<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:10.650> does<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.310> smaller

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
same boss but it does have a smaller

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.480 
same boss but it does have a smaller
health<00:05:11.970> pool<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.479> think<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.190> do<00:05:14.250> notice

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
health pool I think that I do notice

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.390 
health pool I think that I do notice
that<00:05:14.669> I<00:05:14.760> kill<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.000> obviously<00:05:15.720> much<00:05:15.990> quicker<00:05:16.400> so

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
that I kill it obviously much quicker so

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.070 
that I kill it obviously much quicker so
I<00:05:17.430> guess<00:05:17.580> this<00:05:17.729> is<00:05:17.940> just<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.539> green<00:05:18.840> version

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
I guess this is just the green version

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.260 
I guess this is just the green version
of<00:05:19.320> little<00:05:19.590> Leviathan<00:05:20.280> yeah<00:05:20.550> weird<00:05:20.880> shade<00:05:21.120> of

hundred times doing this that's

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.790

generally<00:05:51.180> what<00:05:51.300> I've<00:05:51.419> noticed<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:52.650> know

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
generally what I've noticed you know

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.770 
generally what I've noticed you know
it's<00:05:53.010> not<00:05:53.130> like<00:05:53.190> flawless<00:05:54.030> logic<00:05:54.210> but<00:05:54.599> it's

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
it's not like flawless logic but it's

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.400 
it's not like flawless logic but it's
just<00:05:54.990> what<00:05:55.169> I<00:05:55.200> believe<00:05:55.500> cuz<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:57.360> gods<00:05:57.599> of<00:05:57.780> RNG

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
just what I believe cuz the gods of RNG

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.310 
just what I believe cuz the gods of RNG
may<00:05:59.010> have<00:05:59.190> told<00:05:59.460> me<00:05:59.610> that

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
may have told me that

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.230 
may have told me that
you<00:06:00.950> early<00:06:01.100> for<00:06:01.280> my<00:06:01.400> analysis<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.940> I'm<00:06:05.090> not

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
you early for my analysis and I'm not

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.680 
you early for my analysis and I'm not
entirely<00:06:05.540> sure<00:06:05.750> if<00:06:05.960> the<00:06:06.430> squid<00:06:07.690> octopus

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
entirely sure if the squid octopus

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.690 
entirely sure if the squid octopus
monster<00:06:08.870> thing<00:06:09.320> can<00:06:09.860> actually<00:06:10.130> drop<00:06:10.310> sweet

monster thing can actually drop sweet
water<00:06:10.880> I'm<00:06:11.090> assuming<00:06:11.540> it<00:06:11.630> can<00:06:11.810> but<00:06:12.410> I'm<00:06:12.650> not

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
water I'm assuming it can but I'm not
