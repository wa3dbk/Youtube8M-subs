00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 with the nexus 4 google has shown that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.639
 fast components and big displays 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.710
 do not be the upper class edit 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.090
 have to 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.340
 this example was followed by dubai with the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.900
 scb 615 in which one also on 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.019
 fast components, however, begins 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.539
 has saved little on material where 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.899
 google or lg after of glass 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.969
 set and very high-quality plastic 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.010
 you really get one out at 615 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.290
 Plastic existing back the in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.559
 the middle gives a cheap that is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.059
 not quite as critical stronger 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 disturbs the very smooth 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.360
 surface at which one on any 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.590
 waived texturing had only 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.280
 a small metallic effects sda whether this 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.210
 like is a question of taste 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.690
 In principle, this also applies to the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 general optics of the device whether this is 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 now plain or boring or 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.450
 monotonous is everyone's name 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.850
 leave 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.799
 Fact is that you are on 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.560
 has waived any highlight looks 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:19.920
 once from this little silvery one 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.350
 frame around the camera lens from the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.689
 two biggest highlights of the g6 115 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.150
 are certainly the big display as well 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.250
 the fast saw at the display 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 each leaves at 1 4 5 inches 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 measuring ips panel with 1280 x 720 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.280
 pixeln that he can do this very well 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.220
 recognize 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680
 a virtually unadulterated color representation 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 ensures even at larger angles 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.850
 the quad core soc and its four arm 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 cortex a9 cores ensures a fluid 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.549
 illustration of the surface looks here 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.340
 one that there are no misfires and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.469
 no jerks and this though only 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.909
 android 4.0 4 comes to use july has 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.979
 already announced that in march a 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.420
 update on android the bees follow 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.560
 So it can be assumed 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.539
 be that is another 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 acceleration of the surface 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:18.510
 how to give programs and the browser 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.489
 will generally be programs too 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.769
 quickly loaded 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.659
 in the different benchmarks could 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.040
 the device is partly clear from 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:31.230
 nexus 4 settling remains to be seen 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.810
 how it looks in the long term especially in 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.019
 terms of software update the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.060
 could give another push 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.329
 The battery has a capacity of 17 watts 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.769
 hours or 2150 milliamp hours 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.680
 this is a bit more than the nexus 4 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.959
 what is also in the term neustadt 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.269
 here the g6 15 reached our tests 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.659
 around five to six hours depending on 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.590
 setting the display brightness 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.209
 Everyday use must be the device 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.799
 however, usually after about 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.799
 one and a half days to be reloaded 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.590
 binding at a sale price 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.889
 299 euro is clear that you have certain 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.019
 losses have to be taken on the g 615 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.959
 in concrete terms this means one more 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.579
 simple optics comparatively cheap 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.919
 materials a battery of none 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.239
 offers especially good terms and 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:32.930
 a somewhat outdated android version for 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.510
 The device, however, speaks that big 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.639
 and usually enough bright display with 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.639
 his psp the high pixeldichte the 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.229
 fast system surface but also the 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.659
 fact that you have the internal memory 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:51.139
 the eight gigabyte from the factory something 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.169
 smaller fails can expand 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:56.699
 in return points the nexus 4 with the 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.510
 twice as much RAM as well 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:03.209
 a quasi-guarantee on fast 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.849
 Android updates nevertheless you can with the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.220
 Act 115 do very little wrong 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.930
 for a little money a big and before 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.239
 All very nice device is looking for 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.239
 the newcomer very well advised
