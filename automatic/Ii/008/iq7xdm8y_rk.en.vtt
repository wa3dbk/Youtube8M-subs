00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
spawning right in front or right behind

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.529 
spawning right in front or right behind
an<00:01:46.679> enemy<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.159> sometimes<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.880> spine<00:01:48.179> could<00:01:48.389> be

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
an enemy so sometimes the spine could be

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.300 
an enemy so sometimes the spine could be
for<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:49.020> advantage<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.740> most<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.130> time

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
for your advantage but most of the time

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.069 
for your advantage but most of the time
it's<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.520> disadvantage<00:01:51.179> because<00:01:51.299> usually<00:01:51.539> spun

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it's a disadvantage because usually spun

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.959 
it's a disadvantage because usually spun
right<00:01:52.289> in<00:01:52.469> front<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.709> the<00:01:52.829> enemy's<00:01:53.219> line<00:01:53.819> of

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
right in front of the enemy's line of

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.730 
right in front of the enemy's line of
fire<00:01:54.209> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.569> usually<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.229> get<00:01:55.349> spawn

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
fire and then usually just get spawn

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800 
fire and then usually just get spawn

on colgate events worker but I really um
and<00:02:02.819> kind<00:02:03.389> of<00:02:03.419> disappointed<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and kind of disappointed that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.139 
and kind of disappointed that
sledgehammer<00:02:05.009> didn't<00:02:05.489> we<00:02:05.579> fixed<00:02:06.029> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
sledgehammer didn't we fixed that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.690 
sledgehammer didn't we fixed that
because<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.899> don't<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.590> why<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.859> spawn<00:02:08.429> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
because I don't see why you spawn so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.309 
because I don't see why you spawn so
close<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> each<00:02:09.209> other<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.479> don't<00:02:09.720> know<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.020> if

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
close to each other I don't know is if

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.070 
close to each other I don't know is if

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
it's because the maps are kind of small
