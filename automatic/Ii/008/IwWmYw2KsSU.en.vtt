00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
clips and starting this thing off you'll

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.899 
clips and starting this thing off you'll
see<00:02:11.409> why<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.620> charging<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.340> thing<00:02:12.640> is

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
ridiculous I'm under half health one

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.510 
ridiculous I'm under half health one
shot<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:16.150> may

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
shot and I may

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.540 
shot and I may
I<00:02:16.690> love<00:02:17.690> shockwave<00:02:19.780> his<00:02:20.780> melee<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.950> ridiculous

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
I love shockwave his melee is ridiculous

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.260 
I love shockwave his melee is ridiculous
his<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.480> gun<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.530> ridiculous

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
his a gun is ridiculous

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.140 
his a gun is ridiculous
his<00:02:26.930> health<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.260> ridiculous<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.880> see<00:02:29.060> how

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
his health is ridiculous you see how

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.340 
his health is ridiculous you see how
long<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.480> took<00:02:29.570> me<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.720> take<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:29.900> dude<00:02:30.170> down

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
long it took me to take that dude down

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.610 
long it took me to take that dude down
but<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.220> reason<00:02:31.550> why<00:02:32.290> shockwave<00:02:33.290> was<00:02:33.410> so

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
but the reason why shockwave was so

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.110 
but the reason why shockwave was so
ridiculous<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.310> because<00:02:34.490> he<00:02:34.580> doesn't<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.090> a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
ridiculous is because he doesn't have a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.880 
ridiculous is because he doesn't have a
transform<00:02:35.840> for<00:02:36.880> me<00:02:37.880> personally<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.810> would<00:02:39.710> jump

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
transform for me personally I would jump

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.490 
transform for me personally I would jump
on<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.190> fucking<00:02:40.550> worm<00:02:40.730> something<00:02:41.570> sorry<00:02:42.350> for

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
not being able to run away I mean I

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.640 
not being able to run away I mean I
could<00:02:55.970> put<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.180> work<00:02:56.330> with<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.870> use<00:02:57.530> an

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
could put in work with them I use an

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.000 
could put in work with them I use an
omni<00:02:58.450> omni<00:02:59.450> rocket<00:02:59.780> barrage<00:02:59.930> because<00:03:00.470> if<00:03:00.830> I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
omni omni rocket barrage because if I

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.380 
omni omni rocket barrage because if I
get<00:03:01.160> outnumbered<00:03:01.610> which<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.850> his<00:03:02.030> biggest

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
get outnumbered which is his biggest

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.610 
get outnumbered which is his biggest
weakness<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:02.840> when<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.140> get<00:03:03.260> out<00:03:03.350> number

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
weakness is when you get out number

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.530 
weakness is when you get out number
because<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:03.860> can't<00:03:04.070> run<00:03:04.220> away<00:03:04.420> because<00:03:05.420> it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
because you can't run away because it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.390 
because you can't run away because it
hits<00:03:05.720> everybody<00:03:06.260> around<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> so

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
hits everybody around you and that is so

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.270 
hits everybody around you and that is so
nice

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
nice

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.830 
nice

rocket<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:25.700> uh

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
rocket but uh

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.500 
rocket but uh
you<00:03:27.160> put<00:03:27.550> in<00:03:27.640> work<00:03:27.820> if<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:28.090> know<00:03:28.180> how<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.330> use

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
you put in work if you know how to use

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.790 
you put in work if you know how to use
it<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:29.020> gun<00:03:29.290> guns<00:03:30.450> kind<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.800> megatron's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
it that gun guns kind of like megatron's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.940 
it that gun guns kind of like megatron's
but<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.000> doesn't<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.740> doesn't

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
but it doesn't get like it doesn't

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.280 
but it doesn't get like it doesn't
decrease<00:03:36.220> its<00:03:36.940> ammo<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.570> longer<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.990> hold<00:03:38.110> on

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
decrease its ammo the longer you hold on

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.010 
decrease its ammo the longer you hold on
to<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.500> because<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.850> have<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.060> walk<00:03:40.390> around<00:03:40.750> so

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
it's kind of a benefit of not having a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.050 
it's kind of a benefit of not having a
transformation

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060
