00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.650 
vortex hybrid heat pumps take one unit
of<00:02:28.380> energy<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.890> turn<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.550> into<00:02:29.670> five<00:02:30.060> units<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
of energy and turn it into five units of

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.199 
of energy and turn it into five units of
heat<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.590> even<00:02:32.010> accounting<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.820> cost<00:02:33.030> of

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
heat so even accounting for the cost of

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.570 
heat so even accounting for the cost of
running<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.690> pumps<00:02:34.110> over<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:35.130> running
