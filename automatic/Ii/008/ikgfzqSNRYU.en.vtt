try<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:22.910> go<00:03:23.209> into<00:03:23.419> a<00:03:23.449> link<00:03:23.690> there<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.280> say<00:03:25.280> if<00:03:25.400> I

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
try to go into a link there to say if I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
so you've got this of the keyboard that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.850 
so you've got this of the keyboard that
comes<00:03:38.720> out<00:03:39.140> now<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.350> can<00:03:39.470> see<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:39.740> is

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
comes out now you can see this is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.950 
comes out now you can see this is
different<00:03:40.040> obviously<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:43.960> handsets

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
different obviously to the the handsets

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.770 
different obviously to the the handsets
default<00:03:45.410> keyboard<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:47.000> is<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.210> bit<00:03:47.450> tricky<00:03:47.570> to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
default keyboard it is a bit tricky to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.260 
default keyboard it is a bit tricky to
use<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.260> all<00:03:48.440> on<00:03:48.620> one<00:03:49.490> bit<00:03:49.700> even<00:03:49.940> if<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.150> do

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
use it is all on one bit even if you do

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.560 
use it is all on one bit even if you do
turn<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.630> around<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.820> know<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.060> does<00:03:53.180> make<00:03:53.420> it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
turn it around you know it does make it

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.710 
turn it around you know it does make it
slightly<00:03:53.840> easier<00:03:54.640> but<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.730> still<00:03:56.150> feels<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.630> bit

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
slightly easier but it still feels a bit

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.070 
slightly easier but it still feels a bit
fiddly<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.680> use<00:03:58.460> the<00:03:59.300> letters<00:03:59.780> are<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.960> bit

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
fiddly to use the letters are a bit

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.290 
fiddly to use the letters are a bit
close<00:04:00.290> together<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.890> mean<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.490> can<00:04:01.910> get<00:04:02.060> used

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
close together I mean you can get used

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.110 
close together I mean you can get used

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
for it or not but to be quite honest I

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.550 
for it or not but to be quite honest I
mean<00:06:33.210> it's<00:06:33.330> such<00:06:33.930> a<00:06:33.990> pleasurable<00:06:34.409> experience

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560

that<00:06:36.569> I<00:06:36.629> think<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.499> would<00:06:37.770> be<00:06:37.800> worth<00:06:38.039> it

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
that I think it would be worth it

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.209 
that I think it would be worth it
obviously<00:06:38.550> depending<00:06:38.909> on<00:06:38.969> how<00:06:39.060> much<00:06:39.180> it<00:06:39.360> costs

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
obviously depending on how much it costs

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:42.230 
obviously depending on how much it costs
but<00:06:41.219> it's<00:06:41.339> certainly<00:06:41.460> changed<00:06:41.909> you<00:06:41.999> know<00:06:42.089> my
