00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.050 

and<00:02:37.959> when<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.950> play<00:02:39.159> this<00:02:39.310> note<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:42.519> band<00:02:42.790> here

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.349 
and when I play this note this band here
I<00:02:43.209> often<00:02:43.689> do<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> little<00:02:44.439> bit<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.969> break<00:02:45.969> I

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
I often do a little bit of a break I

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.690 
I often do a little bit of a break I
muting<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.200> g<00:02:47.590> string<00:02:47.799> above<00:02:50.400> sometimes<00:02:51.400> even

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
muting the g string above sometimes even

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.220 
muting the g string above sometimes even
the<00:02:51.819> D<00:02:52.000> string<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> g<00:02:53.049> string

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the D string and and the g string

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.140 
the D string and and the g string
because<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.349> makes<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.189> cool<00:02:57.730> way<00:02:58.120> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
because it makes for a cool way to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.170 
because it makes for a cool way to
approach<00:02:58.689> that<00:02:58.959> note<00:02:59.170> it's<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:01.930> subtle<00:03:03.180> but

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
approach that note it's very subtle but

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.929 
approach that note it's very subtle but
it's<00:03:04.599> there<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.230> then<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> apply<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.129> vibrato

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:15.750 

and<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:14.530> note<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.859> can<00:03:14.889> bend<00:03:15.189> up<00:03:15.310> as<00:03:15.489> much<00:03:15.700> as

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
and this note you can bend up as much as

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.809 
and this note you can bend up as much as
you<00:03:16.000> want<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:17.200> not<00:03:17.409> more<00:03:17.680> than<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:17.980> whole<00:03:18.159> set

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.890 

that's<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:21.909> whole<00:03:22.090> step<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.510> if<00:03:22.599> you<00:03:22.689> want<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
that's a whole step but if you want to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.690 
that's a whole step but if you want to
do<00:03:22.989> yes<00:03:23.169> to<00:03:23.319> half<00:03:23.469> step<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.780> works<00:03:25.959> fine<00:03:26.169> this

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
do yes to half step it works fine this

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.680 
do yes to half step it works fine this
just<00:03:27.700> fine<00:03:27.849> as<00:03:28.030> well<00:03:28.150> ok<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:28.959> one<00:03:29.379> more<00:03:29.500> time
