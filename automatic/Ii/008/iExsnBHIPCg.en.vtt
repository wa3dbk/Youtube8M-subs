can use it and remove it and it leaves

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.830 
can use it and remove it and it leaves
absolutely<00:00:09.630> no<00:00:10.050> marks<00:00:10.800> left<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.429> violin

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
absolutely no marks left on the violin

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
absolutely no marks left on the violin
so<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> first<00:00:13.530> step<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.920> removing<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
so the first step in removing it and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.510 
so the first step in removing it and
often<00:00:15.630> times<00:00:15.780> people<00:00:16.080> want<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.890> change<00:00:17.279> them

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
often times people want to change them

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.769 
often times people want to change them
when<00:00:17.640> they<00:00:17.730> change<00:00:17.970> their<00:00:18.180> strings<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
when they change their strings it's a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.710 
when they change their strings it's a
good<00:00:18.930> time<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.130> because<00:00:20.369> they<00:00:20.580> do

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
good time to do that because they do

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.179 
good time to do that because they do
take<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.199> where<00:00:22.380> essentially

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
take a little bit of where essentially

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.340 
take a little bit of where essentially
what<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.609> first<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> release<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
what you do first is you release the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.009 
what you do first is you release the
tension<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.430> outer<00:00:26.580> strings<00:00:29.599> and<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
tension on the outer strings and you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.900 
tension on the outer strings and you
bring<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.679> around<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.130> outside<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.759> nut

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
bring them around the outside of the nut

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.690 
bring them around the outside of the nut
and<00:00:33.320> slip<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.469> under<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.309> end<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and slip them under the end of the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
and slip them under the end of the
fingerboard<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:38.930> sometimes<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.170> give<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
fingerboard I sometimes then give a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
fingerboard I sometimes then give a
little<00:00:40.469> bit<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.920> tension<00:00:41.129> back<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
little bit of tension back just so that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.569 
little bit of tension back just so that
this<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.350> strings<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.829> uphold<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.370> bridge

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this the strings will uphold the bridge

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.110 
this the strings will uphold the bridge
in<00:00:44.730> place<00:00:45.469> then<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.309> inner

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
in place then you do it with the inner

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.250 
in place then you do it with the inner
strings<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:49.680> DNA<00:00:50.070> string<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.750> again<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
strings the DNA string and again you do

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
strings the DNA string and again you do
the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.670> slip<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.120> under

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the same thing and just slip it under

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.899 
the same thing and just slip it under
the<00:00:57.360> end<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> fingerboard

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.550 

okay<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.509> now<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.899> have<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.259> fingerboard

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
okay so now you have the fingerboard

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.260 
okay so now you have the fingerboard
completely<00:01:07.549> exposed<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.119> just<00:01:08.750> peel<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.380> off

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270 

and<00:01:14.270> as<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.570> can<00:01:14.659> see<00:01:14.930> there's<00:01:15.200> there's<00:01:15.619> very

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
and as you can see there's there's very

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.310 
and as you can see there's there's very
little<00:01:16.520> residue<00:01:17.360> left<00:01:17.689> on<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.020> but<00:01:18.140> there

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
little residue left on it but there

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.109 
little residue left on it but there
you'll<00:01:18.799> feel<00:01:19.009> maybe<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.369> little<00:01:19.490> stickiness

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
you'll feel maybe a little stickiness

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.940 
you'll feel maybe a little stickiness
here<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.479> there<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.350> what<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.590> want<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.799> do

it on the rag

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.389 
it on the rag
don't<00:01:29.270> put<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:29.899> on<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.079> rag<00:01:30.229> near<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.829> finish

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
of the violin alcohol can sometimes

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.050 
of the violin alcohol can sometimes
sting<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:35.569> finish<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.049> violin<00:01:36.849> so<00:01:37.849> then<00:01:37.970> you

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
sting the finish of a violin so then you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:49.779 
sting the finish of a violin so then you
just<00:01:38.330> rub<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.049> neck<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:48.439> this<00:01:49.189> for<00:01:49.759> example

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
just rub the neck and this for example

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.330 
just rub the neck and this for example
is<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.209> color<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.140> belly<00:01:51.409> violins<00:01:52.039> very

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
is a color of the belly violins very

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.660 
is a color of the belly violins very
inexpensive<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.860> often<00:01:54.860> times<00:01:55.159> they<00:01:55.399> dye

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
inexpensive and and often times they dye

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.520 
inexpensive and and often times they dye
the<00:01:55.729> fingerboard<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:57.020> can<00:01:57.170> see<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.349> little

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
the fingerboard and you can see a little

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.620 
the fingerboard and you can see a little
bit<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.740> dye<00:01:58.009> came<00:01:58.310> off<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:59.179> you'll<00:01:59.329> find<00:01:59.479> that

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
bit of dye came off but you'll find that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.600 
bit of dye came off but you'll find that
the<00:02:00.110> alcohol<00:02:00.439> will<00:02:00.590> not<00:02:00.740> really<00:02:01.009> discover<00:02:01.399> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
the alcohol will not really discover the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.940 
the alcohol will not really discover the
fingerboard<00:02:01.880> nor<00:02:02.360> will<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.689> affect<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.619> any

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
fingerboard nor will it affect it in any

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.839 
fingerboard nor will it affect it in any
adverse<00:02:04.459> way<00:02:05.380> once<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.530> have<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.099> neck<00:02:07.310> nice

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
adverse way once you have the neck nice

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.180 
adverse way once you have the neck nice
and<00:02:08.090> clean<00:02:08.299> you<00:02:08.539> just<00:02:09.289> go<00:02:09.739> ahead<00:02:09.829> and<00:02:09.920> take

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
and clean you just go ahead and take

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.190 
and clean you just go ahead and take
your<00:02:10.340> strings<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.090> then<00:02:11.239> put<00:02:11.660> them<00:02:11.810> back<00:02:11.959> into

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
your strings and then put them back into

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.650 
your strings and then put them back into
place

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
place

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.509 
place
now<00:02:14.660> usually<00:02:14.900> start<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.340> inner

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
now usually start with the the inner

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:33.090 
now usually start with the the inner
strength
