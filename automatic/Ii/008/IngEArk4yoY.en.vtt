much done but this has a little bit of

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.420 
much done but this has a little bit of
protein<00:01:07.689> in<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.049> so<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.560> keeps<00:01:08.860> my<00:01:09.070> hair<00:01:09.250> nice

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
of both you don't want to just use only

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.389 
of both you don't want to just use only
moisture<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.929> just<00:01:40.229> only<00:01:40.709> protein<00:01:41.189> unless

that's<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:41.789> your<00:01:41.909> hair<00:01:42.090> likes<00:01:42.329> because

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that's what your hair likes because

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.859 
that's what your hair likes because
everyone's<00:01:43.200> hair<00:01:43.469> is<00:01:43.500> different<00:01:44.630> my<00:01:45.630> hair

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
everyone's hair is different my hair

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
everyone's hair is different my hair
personally<00:01:46.319> like<00:01:46.469> just<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.340> bit<00:01:47.459> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
personally like just a little bit of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.270 
personally like just a little bit of
protein<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.659> next<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.109> is<00:01:49.140> protective<00:01:49.950> styles

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
protein so next one is protective styles

protein so next one is protective styles
protective<00:01:50.789> styles<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.209> perfect<00:01:51.899> when

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
protective styles are perfect when

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.240 

like<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.569> mentioned<00:02:45.900> before<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:47.069> want

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
like I mentioned before you really want

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.619 
like I mentioned before you really want
to<00:02:47.340> make<00:02:47.489> sure<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:47.939> what<00:02:48.090> your<00:02:48.209> prosity

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
level is you want to know what kind of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.640 
level is you want to know what kind of
here<00:02:50.430> you're<00:02:50.549> dealing<00:02:50.939> with<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.959> didn't<00:02:52.439> find

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
here you're dealing with I didn't find

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.830 
here you're dealing with I didn't find
out<00:02:52.799> until<00:02:53.040> late<00:02:53.970> last<00:02:54.000> year<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.599> I<00:02:54.659> had<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
out until late last year that I had a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.250 
out until late last year that I had a
little<00:02:55.049> prosody<00:02:55.379> here

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.280 

and<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:03.010> next<00:03:03.250> one<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.939> reduce<00:03:04.120> heat<00:03:04.599> like

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and the next one is to reduce heat like

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.170 
and the next one is to reduce heat like
I<00:03:05.470> mentioned<00:03:05.769> before<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.280> want<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.730> cut<00:03:07.150> down

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
I mentioned before you want to cut down

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.300 
I mentioned before you want to cut down
on<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.720> amount<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.959> heat<00:03:08.170> you're<00:03:08.349> using<00:03:08.620> for

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
on the amount of heat you're using for

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.100 
on the amount of heat you're using for
me<00:03:09.400> for<00:03:09.610> example<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:10.269> went<00:03:10.420> from<00:03:10.599> every<00:03:10.959> single

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
me for example I went from every single

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.410 
me for example I went from every single
day<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.470> once<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.189> month<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.670> then<00:03:12.849> started

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
day to once a month and then started

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.140 
day to once a month and then started
doing<00:03:14.019> challenges<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.010> think<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.700> longest<00:03:16.090> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
doing challenges I think the longest I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.050 
doing challenges I think the longest I
went<00:03:16.329> without<00:03:16.390> heat<00:03:16.780> was<00:03:17.189> four<00:03:18.189> months<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:18.970> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
went without heat was four months so you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.000 
went without heat was four months so you
want<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.329> try<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.230> cut<00:03:20.440> down<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.860> amount

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
want to try and cut down on the amount

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.860 
want to try and cut down on the amount
of<00:03:21.220> heat<00:03:21.400> you're<00:03:21.549> using<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.540> will<00:03:22.690> see<00:03:22.840> a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
of heat you're using or you will see a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.569 
of heat you're using or you will see a
huge<00:03:23.319> change<00:03:23.379> in<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:23.980> way<00:03:24.069> your<00:03:24.340> hair<00:03:24.549> looks

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
huge change in the way your hair looks

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.610 
huge change in the way your hair looks
the<00:03:25.150> way<00:03:25.329> your<00:03:25.510> hair<00:03:25.659> feels<00:03:25.989> where<00:03:26.319> your<00:03:26.440> hair

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
the way your hair feels where your hair

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.130 
the way your hair feels where your hair
moves<00:03:26.980> if<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.060> reduce<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.659> amount<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.870> heat

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
moves if you reduce the amount of heat

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.420 
moves if you reduce the amount of heat
you're<00:03:29.319> using

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.550 

so<00:03:33.970> now<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.150> next<00:03:34.480> one<00:03:34.599> is<00:03:34.750> from<00:03:34.930> my<00:03:35.019> relaxer
