00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.220
 hello everyone here reason 'welcome to 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.080
 channel and welcome once again to the 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.639
 why you have not slept 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.589
 during the last days waiting for 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.900
 come this moment thinking what noses 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:17.300
 You can ask Gonzalo this week in 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.009
 the question of the week 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.449
 and first of all for all those who 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.980
 you have never seen what this is 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.019
 section that is the first time you are 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.180
 in the channel tell me that I like it and 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.310
 he does not like me, I would prefer not to 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.630
 boots and it's at the moment since they're going 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.489
 to use to answer a question 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.110
 that I'm going to make at the end of the video 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.460
 then depending on what it is that 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.650
 you think you will have to 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.730
 answer forgiveness or I like it or not 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.260
 I like it then I hope there's 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.970
 become clear and we go directly to 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.500
 review last week's question 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.300
 that is to say that the results of the week 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.980
 I did not expect them at all, but 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.960
 good for that is this section for 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.760
 realize what is the opinion more 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.079
 or less than most people who 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.059
 you are watching the video or the channel in 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.980
 this case then we repeat as I say 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.090
 Asked last week remember 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.620
 that we referred to the little 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.570
 teaser trailer that had shown the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.949
 bethesda guys and I was wondering 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.449
 I went into doing that company a little 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.729
 what is it but you have more than 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.800
 intermediate games or fallout of a new 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.330
 stop or a new puppets cross the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.890
 votes are more or less equal 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.750
 at the beginning but always as usual 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.640
 in the end he has decided more with a 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.460
 option in this case by the like and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.800
 finally tell you that the 187 people 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.119
 you think that you will see with more desire 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.070
 rather a new fall out while 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.170
 that 122 people 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.850
 with more desire a new day in er scrolls 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.860
 What we like most, for example, is that 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.659
 this case the most voted comments 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.030
 We first as always and 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.310
 they are taking out the usual or 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.960
 of professional already in this to have the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.300
 Most voted comment as always 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.090
 we found with maikel villalta that we 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.259
 says that fallout was precisely one of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.180
 the reasons to buy the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.880
 playstation3 imagine what you like 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.229
 to the lad the mother stick of mine you have 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.240
 I hope you like and certainly 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.890
 enjoy it is a lot and to be the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 main reason to buy a console 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.310
 but well not only does it also have 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.660
 something to say in of course we 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.729
 we find with kimura mx 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.300
 m12 I do not know how he in your name I'm sorry 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.310
 much 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.320
 good atmosphere is the best 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.750
 ensures in the forum video game you do not 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.729
 lack reason boy or girl subject 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.320
 subject ultimately there was also 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.850
 some other person who thought that 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.910
 he liked rather to fuck them for 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.580
 example do not you pique team said that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.580
 it would be the cock 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.580
 to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.970
 and this week's theme has to do 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.290
 a bit with the video games that will 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.960
 gone on sale and that are expected to 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.640
 this year 2013 and is that recently a 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.710
 well-known online videogame magazine 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.290
 called computer and videogames has 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.090
 conducted a kind of survey of their 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.830
 users asking what was the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.720
 video game that most waited or with more 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.580
 I was hoping they would rather be expected for what 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.290
 that remains of this year in this case the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.750
 result has been quite clear and the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.460
 most bet on what's 2 a title 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.200
 that in case you do not know it, I'll leave you 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.460
 the description a link so you can 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.350
 see a trailer of what a little bit is going on 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.940
 theme but good now the question that you 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.940
 I wanted to do I agree with 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.250
 this survey and participated thousands of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.540
 people in the question so I 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.160
 I would like to know your opinion a little 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.290
 from a little more point of view 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 Hispanic or more Spanish or Latin America 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.130
 Ultimately I would like to know if 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.350
 you agree and if so, if you think 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.540
 that the videogame that you want most you have 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.640
 that goes on sale is a lot 2 not 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.110
 Do not hesitate to give it to me, but if 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.850
 the opposite is any other different 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.010
 do not hesitate to give it to me I do not like and 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.120
 step on it in the comments and if 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.590
 you see that someone has put in the 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.240
 comments one of the video games that 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.100
 you are also the one you most expect 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.420
 I like to speak in order to see the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.180
