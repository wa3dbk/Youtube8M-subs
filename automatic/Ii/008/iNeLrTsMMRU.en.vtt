00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
more sense and I thought I'd probably

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090 
more sense and I thought I'd probably
the<00:01:35.549> best<00:01:36.180> way<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> coin<00:01:37.470> balance<00:01:37.890> guys

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100

quit<00:04:15.959> which<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.560> another<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.070> number<00:04:17.310> one<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.639> I

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729
