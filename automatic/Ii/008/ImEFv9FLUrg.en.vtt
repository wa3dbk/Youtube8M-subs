00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
guy really in the last moments of his
life<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.780> video<00:01:10.020> does<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.260> show<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
life the video does not show the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.789 
life the video does not show the
shooting<00:01:12.180> itself<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.869> cuts<00:01:13.080> off<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.500> before

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
shooting itself it cuts off right before

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.920 
shooting itself it cuts off right before
it<00:01:14.010> happens<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.700> helps<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> suspect

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it happens if that helps and I suspect

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
it happens if that helps and I suspect
it<00:01:16.380> may<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.700> thought<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> was

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it may but it's we thought it was

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.950 
it may but it's we thought it was
important<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> show<00:01:20.150> because<00:01:21.150> ridiculous<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
important to show because ridiculous it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.690 
important to show because ridiculous it
is<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.320> give<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> nine-year-old<00:01:22.979> girl<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
is to give a nine-year-old girl that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.090 
is to give a nine-year-old girl that
type<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.150> weaponry<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.600> any<00:01:24.869> weaponry<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.710> all

type of weaponry or any weaponry at all

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
type of weaponry or any weaponry at all
so<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.090> right<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> give<00:01:27.930> an

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so it's right so to give an

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.530 
so it's right so to give an
understanding<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.619> how<00:01:29.460> absurd<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
understanding of how absurd it is and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.520 
understanding of how absurd it is and
you'll<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> nine-year-old

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
something Isis is doing

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you don't give children fully automatic

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.050 
you don't give children fully automatic
weapons<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> ooze<00:02:16.829> ease<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.160> go<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
weapons and ooze ease and go go for it
