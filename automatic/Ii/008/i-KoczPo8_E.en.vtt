that<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> rebuilt<00:00:36.570> replaces<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> piston<00:00:37.829> rings

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that I rebuilt replaces a piston rings

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.869 
that I rebuilt replaces a piston rings
on<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.340> mower<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.760> I'm

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
on and this is just a mower that I'm

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
on and this is just a mower that I'm
working<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.140> transmission<00:00:43.860> trouble

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
working on got some transmission trouble

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.650 
working on got some transmission trouble
with<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.110> rear<00:00:46.110> wheel<00:00:46.350> self<00:00:46.710> propelled

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
with the rear wheel self propelled

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.930 
with the rear wheel self propelled
system<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> got<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> tire<00:00:50.160> off<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.760> on

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
system so I got the tire off there on

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.799 
system so I got the tire off there on
the<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.270> end<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:53.210> there's<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> engine<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the back end and there's the engine that

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
the back end and there's the engine that
I<00:00:54.840> rebuilt<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> thought<00:00:56.399> I'd<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.789> how<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
I rebuilt so I thought I'd see how it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.599 
I rebuilt so I thought I'd see how it
fires<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.510> being<00:00:58.500> about<00:00:58.590> six<00:00:59.010> degrees<00:01:01.609> then

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
fires up being about six degrees then

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.719 
fires up being about six degrees then
batteries<00:01:03.359> don't<00:01:03.989> last<00:01:04.110> worth<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> darn<00:01:05.010> from

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
batteries don't last worth a darn from

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.590 
batteries don't last worth a darn from
these<00:01:06.000> things<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.280> there

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
these things and I got that one there

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
these things and I got that one there
and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> Briggs<00:01:10.860> or

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and then the one for the Briggs or

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
and then the one for the Briggs or
the<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> engine<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> rebuilt

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the one for the engine that I rebuilt

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.240 
the one for the engine that I rebuilt
the<00:01:14.189> black<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:15.200> it's<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.409> over<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the black one it's right over there in

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.510 
the black one it's right over there in
that<00:01:18.000> box<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.770> dead<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that box and it's dead so you have to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.399 
that box and it's dead so you have to
yep<00:01:23.790> charging<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.600> once<00:01:24.869> every<00:01:25.259> month<00:01:26.000> but

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
yep charging like once every month but

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
yep charging like once every month but
I've<00:01:28.409> got<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.890> handy<00:01:29.280> dandy<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.640> nifty<00:01:29.970> key

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
I've got my handy dandy little nifty key

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.800 
I've got my handy dandy little nifty key
no<00:01:30.540> battery<00:01:31.259> charger<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.810> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
no battery charger here and that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
no battery charger here and that
provides<00:01:34.259> enough<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> charging

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
provides enough just on the charging

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.710 
provides enough just on the charging
cycle<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.270> crank<00:01:36.720> these<00:01:36.900> engines<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
cycle to crank these engines up so I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.740 
cycle to crank these engines up so I
decided<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.470> use<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.890> electric<00:01:41.340> start

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
decided to use the electric start

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.060 
decided to use the electric start
instead<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> manual<00:01:43.409> start<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:43.890> it's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
instead of the manual start because it's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.929 
instead of the manual start because it's
more<00:01:44.280> fun<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.140> 1944<00:01:47.040> John<00:01:47.340> Deere<00:01:47.579> said

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
more fun and like I 1944 John Deere said

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.910 
more fun and like I 1944 John Deere said
it's<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:48.899> luxurious

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it's more luxurious

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
it's more luxurious
I<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> electric<00:01:51.149> start<00:01:51.450> he<00:01:51.540> put<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.869> his

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
I like that electric start he put on his

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.760 
I like that electric start he put on his
engine<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:54.299> let's<00:01:54.509> start<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.079> first<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
engine so let's start this one first I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
engine so let's start this one first I
want<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.250> how<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.490> thing<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
want to see how this thing that I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.359 
want to see how this thing that I
rebuilt<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.380> settle<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.100> full

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
rebuilt in this will settle the full

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.770 
rebuilt in this will settle the full
right<00:02:00.270> three<00:02:00.630> times<00:02:04.219> let's<00:02:05.219> crank<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.850> up

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
right three times let's crank it up

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:16.540 
right three times let's crank it up
oh<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.640> first

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.170 

where's<00:02:17.550> my<00:02:17.790> indepth<00:02:18.270> Eva's<00:02:19.760> put<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.880> into

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
where's my indepth Eva's put it into

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.740 
where's my indepth Eva's put it into
this<00:02:21.500> cognition<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:23.300> removed<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
this cognition I removed it from the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.449 
this cognition I removed it from the
frame<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.910> haven't<00:02:27.860> now<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.220> engine

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
frame so I haven't now that this engine

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:51.340 
frame so I haven't now that this engine
on<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.820> frame<00:02:30.030> yet<00:02:48.290> see<00:02:49.290> how<00:02:49.440> she<00:02:49.500> fires<00:02:49.950> up

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
on the frame yet see how she fires up

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:03.860 
on the frame yet see how she fires up
voltage

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.970 

I<00:03:06.110> think<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.260> got<00:03:07.440> fuel

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
I think I got fuel

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.930
