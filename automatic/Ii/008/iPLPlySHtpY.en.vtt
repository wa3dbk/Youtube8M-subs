medium or hard now what i'm doing here
is<00:01:29.460> easy<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:30.270> i'm<00:01:30.630> still<00:01:30.810> trying<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
is easy because i'm still trying to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.590 
is easy because i'm still trying to
learn<00:01:31.229> how<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> game<00:01:32.159> works<00:01:32.340> obviously<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:33.570> i

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
learn how the game works obviously now i

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
learn how the game works obviously now i
think<00:01:33.810> i<00:01:34.020> took<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.530> towards<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.890> end<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
think i took this up towards the end of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.370 
think i took this up towards the end of
the<00:01:35.189> game<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.000> wave<00:01:36.210> 89<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the game I think was wave 89 in the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
the game I think was wave 89 in the
right<00:01:37.740> hand<00:01:37.920> side<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.700> but

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
right hand side you can see it but

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.149 
right hand side you can see it but
things<00:01:39.750> gets<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.140> intense<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
things gets more intense here now you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859 
things gets more intense here now you
can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> zombies<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.329> rush<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
can see the zombies they rush to the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.330 
can see the zombies they rush to the
ones<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.350> ran<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.649> yet<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.009> nothing

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
ones that just ran out yet with nothing

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
ones that just ran out yet with nothing
there's<00:01:45.000> ones<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.270> guns<00:01:45.509> there's<00:01:45.869> ones<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
there's ones with guns there's ones that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.960 
there's ones with guns there's ones that
shoot<00:01:46.350> flamethrowers<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.909> this

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
shoot flamethrowers and I think at this

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.249 
shoot flamethrowers and I think at this
point<00:01:48.090> there's<00:01:48.390> ones<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.810> rocket<00:01:49.229> launchers

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
point there's ones with rocket launchers

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.310 
point there's ones with rocket launchers
and<00:01:49.970> towards<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> end<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.420> giant<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.049> boss

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
and towards the end the giant like boss

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.230 
and towards the end the giant like boss
zombie<00:01:52.829> kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.159> came<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.850> there's<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.210> couple

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
zombie kind of came in there's a couple

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
zombie kind of came in there's a couple
of<00:01:54.509> them<00:01:54.630> come<00:01:54.869> throughout<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> waves<00:01:55.409> now

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
of them come throughout the waves now

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.319 
of them come throughout the waves now
like<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.490> said<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.909> easy

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
like I said this is easy

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.870 
like I said this is easy
so<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.869> medium<00:01:58.170> difficult<00:01:58.710> come<00:01:58.890> along<00:01:59.159> it's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
so as medium difficult come along it's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
so as medium difficult come along it's
gonna<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> lot<00:02:00.329> more<00:02:00.479> hard<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.500> admit<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
gonna be a lot more hard I will admit I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.190 
gonna be a lot more hard I will admit I
