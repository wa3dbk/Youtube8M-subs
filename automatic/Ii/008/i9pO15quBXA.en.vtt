00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
and the clinical staff have access to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.300 
and the clinical staff have access to
the<00:02:11.810> knowledge<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.350> capabilities<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.220> a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the knowledge and the capabilities of a

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.610 
the knowledge and the capabilities of a
complete<00:02:13.670> engineering<00:02:14.120> staff<00:02:14.329> that<00:02:14.959> are<00:02:15.290> here

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
complete engineering staff that are here

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.790 
complete engineering staff that are here
at<00:02:16.070> Mayo

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
at Mayo

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.320 
at Mayo
and<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.280> been<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> part<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> clinic's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and have been a part of the clinic's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.190 
and have been a part of the clinic's
operation<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.020> over<00:02:19.260> 60<00:02:19.620> years<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
operation for over 60 years the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.470 
operation for over 60 years the
development<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.600> devices<00:02:25.580> are<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:27.240> much

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
development of the devices are are much

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.400 
development of the devices are are much
improved<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> engineers<00:02:29.280> are<00:02:30.410> able

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
improved because the engineers are able

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.210 
improved because the engineers are able
to<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.910> part<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.960> treatment<00:02:34.410> process

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to to be a part of the treatment process

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.940 
to to be a part of the treatment process
can<00:02:36.090> understand<00:02:36.660> what<00:02:36.840> needs<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.260> done<00:02:37.410> can

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
can understand what needs to be done can

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.950 
can understand what needs to be done can
build<00:02:38.280> devices<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.060> convey<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.720> brought

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
build devices and convey can be brought

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.560 
build devices and convey can be brought
back<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.610> physician<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
back to the physician and the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300 
back to the physician and the
researchers<00:02:43.050> were<00:02:43.560> really<00:02:43.890> immediate

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
researchers were really immediate

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.260 
researchers were really immediate
testing<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.540> therefore<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:47.270> devices

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
testing and so therefore the devices

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.180 
testing and so therefore the devices
that<00:02:48.300> are<00:02:48.630> prepared<00:02:49.080> are<00:02:49.560> much<00:02:49.800> more<00:02:50.010> useful

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that are prepared are much more useful

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.850 
that are prepared are much more useful
to<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> actual<00:02:51.330> real-world<00:02:51.600> experiences<00:02:52.590> of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
to the actual real-world experiences of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.480 
to the actual real-world experiences of
the<00:02:53.460> other<00:02:53.910> clinical<00:02:54.240> staff
