for the mailings and no part one which

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.410 
for the mailings and no part one which
is<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:10.889> two<00:00:11.099> steps<00:00:11.340> was<00:00:11.759> really

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
is just the first two steps was really

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.570 
is just the first two steps was really
really<00:00:12.660> long<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.200> just<00:00:13.679> was<00:00:13.920> actually<00:00:14.099> seven

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
really long I just was actually seven

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
really long I just was actually seven
minutes<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:16.220> that's<00:00:17.220> fine<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> stop<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.439> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
minutes so that's fine is stop this the

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.250 
minutes so that's fine is stop this the
third<00:00:19.680> set<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.369> probably<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.270> most

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
third set which is probably the most

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
third set which is probably the most
time-consuming<00:00:22.590> set<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.330> actually

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
time-consuming set not in actually

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.990 
time-consuming set not in actually
executing<00:00:25.260> but<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.619> explaining<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.760> me<00:00:27.170> so

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
executing but in explaining it for me so

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.920 
executing but in explaining it for me so
um<00:00:30.470> well<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.650> second<00:00:31.949> step<00:00:32.390> or<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.719> third

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
um well the second step or the third

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.700 
um well the second step or the third
step<00:00:34.140> brother<00:00:35.329> what<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
step brother what you do just like a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
step brother what you do just like a
three<00:00:37.860> by<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.820> work<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
three by three and you work with the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.049 
three by three and you work with the
corners<00:00:39.660> after<00:00:40.110> these<00:00:40.649> five<00:00:41.460> edges<00:00:41.760> are

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
corners after these five edges are

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
corners after these five edges are
commuted<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.750> through<00:00:42.930> three<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.469> made<00:00:44.399> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
commuted I get through three you made so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.410 
commuted I get through three you made so
that<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.879> corners<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:46.399> all<00:00:47.399> how<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> need

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that the corners are all how you need

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.529 
that the corners are all how you need
them<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.059> they

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
them to be or just like this so they

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.340 
them to be or just like this so they
either<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:53.160> their<00:00:53.340> salt<00:00:53.640> or

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
either look like this not their salt or

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
either look like this not their salt or
that<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.680> need<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.010> flipped<00:00:56.399> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that they just need to be flipped in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
that they just need to be flipped in
order<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.360> solved<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:57.960> yeah<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.680> we're

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
order to be solved so yeah so what we're

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.229 
order to be solved so yeah so what we're
going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> third<00:01:00.030> step<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:02.239> first

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
going to do for the third step and first

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.649 
going to do for the third step and first
thing<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.519> now<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:06.210> five

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
thing I want to do is now that all five

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.170 
thing I want to do is now that all five
of<00:01:06.720> these<00:01:06.990> are<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> correct<00:01:07.680> spot<00:01:08.180> look

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
of these are in the correct spot look

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.550 
of these are in the correct spot look
around<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> five<00:01:10.560> corners<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.220> check<00:01:11.520> any

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
around the five corners to check any

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.039 
around the five corners to check any
corners<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.740> correct<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
corners are correct or just like that

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.410 
corners are correct or just like that
just<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.860> sorry<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:18.090> certain

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
just like this one sorry that's certain

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.289 
just like this one sorry that's certain
crackpot<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.049> may<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.350> flipped<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.299> glad

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
crackpot they may be flipped so glad

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.280 
crackpot they may be flipped so glad
this<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.960> then<00:01:24.960> show<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
this one and this one and then show you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.499 
this one and this one and then show you
right<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.880> first<00:01:27.119> thing<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> want

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
right now not the first thing you want

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.530 
right now not the first thing you want
to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.110> sub<00:01:29.100> steps<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to do this right sub steps to this you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.300 
to do this right sub steps to this you
run<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:33.060> you're<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
run up for one if not you're going to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
run up for one if not you're going to
solve<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.140> sell<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> second

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
solve for one and then sell for a second

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.910 
solve for one and then sell for a second
one<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.220> solve<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.390> last<00:01:39.600> three<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
one and solve for the last three and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.870 
one and solve for the last three and
I'll<00:01:41.549> show<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.729> why<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.610> first

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I'll show you why so for some first

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
I'll show you why so for some first
let's<00:01:45.090> look<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.490> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
let's look for one this one here and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.850 
let's look for one this one here and
another<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.200> but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
another one here I know we need to but

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.340 
another one here I know we need to but
that<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.549> work<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.060> 1<00:01:51.329> i'll<00:01:51.899> tell<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.200> why

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that just work with 1 i'll tell you why

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.070 
that just work with 1 i'll tell you why
we<00:01:52.530> won't<00:01:52.710> work<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.430> these<00:01:53.610> two

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
we won't work with these two

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.730 
we won't work with these two
when<00:01:55.830> when<00:01:56.610> when<00:01:57.480> since<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.140> said<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.560> need

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
when when when since I said that we need

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.300 
when when when since I said that we need
to<00:01:58.770> work<00:01:58.980> with<00:01:59.130> two<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.850> get<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.120> last<00:02:00.330> spring

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
to work with two to get the last spring

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.880 
to work with two to get the last spring
the<00:02:02.310> two<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.790> work<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.330> now<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.530> right

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the two that we work for now to be right

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.460 
the two that we work for now to be right
next<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> each<00:02:05.550> other<00:02:05.730> so<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.360> could<00:02:07.050> be<00:02:07.080> these

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
next to each other so it could be these

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
next to each other so it could be these
two<00:02:07.790> these<00:02:08.790> two<00:02:08.960> these<00:02:09.960> two<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.979> these<00:02:11.250> two

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
two these two these two or these two

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.310 
two these two these two or these two
let's<00:02:11.850> be<00:02:12.060> right<00:02:12.330> next<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> each<00:02:12.750> other<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.200> can

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
let's be right next to each other it can

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.180 
let's be right next to each other it can
be<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.650> across<00:02:14.300> that's<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.630> good<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:19.010> if<00:02:20.010> you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
be like across that's so good so if you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.390 
be like across that's so good so if you
don't<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.760> anything<00:02:21.060> done<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.860> do<00:02:23.250> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
don't have anything done just do this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.940 
don't have anything done just do this
once<00:02:23.940> twice<00:02:24.570> or<00:02:24.960> three<00:02:25.080> times<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.560> you'll<00:02:25.800> get

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
once twice or three times and you'll get

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.890 
once twice or three times and you'll get
it<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.490> least<00:02:26.520> one<00:02:26.850> will<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.330> done<00:02:27.510> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
it so that at least one will be done so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
it so that at least one will be done so
on<00:02:28.710> any<00:02:28.890> corner<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:30.090> use<00:02:30.540> this

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
on any corner and then use this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.449 
on any corner and then use this
algorithm<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.970> two<00:02:33.240> are<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> 20<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:38.070> too

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
algorithm you two are you I 20 I you too

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.140 
algorithm you two are you I 20 I you too
all<00:02:39.209> right<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> 20<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.230> you'll<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:45.120> will

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
all right you I 20 I and you'll you will

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:55.550 
all right you I 20 I and you'll you will
get<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:46.500> least<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:46.830> that's<00:02:47.870> correct<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:54.560> if

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
get on at least one that's correct so if

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.230 
get on at least one that's correct so if
you<00:02:55.709> notice<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.070> algorithm<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.790> exactly

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
you notice that algorithm is exactly

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.509 
you notice that algorithm is exactly
like<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.720> beginners<00:02:58.170> method<00:02:58.650> for<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
like the beginners method for the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.020 
like the beginners method for the
terrific<00:03:00.330> except<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.410> every<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.000> I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
terrific except that every you and you I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.170 
terrific except that every you and you I
you<00:03:03.870> do<00:03:04.170> two<00:03:04.470> instead<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.000> that's<00:03:06.000> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
you do two instead of one that's the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.120 
you do two instead of one that's the
only<00:03:06.450> difference<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:07.620> why<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:07.800> isn't

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
only difference that's why this isn't

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.300 
only difference that's why this isn't
right<00:03:08.730> challenging<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.860> first<00:03:11.070> thing<00:03:11.160> you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
right challenging so the first thing you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.870 
right challenging so the first thing you
want<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.519> do<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.930> guy<00:03:13.230> put<00:03:13.620> fine<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.519> corner

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
want to do this guy put fine one corner

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.750 
want to do this guy put fine one corner
like<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.180> said<00:03:15.239> then<00:03:15.810> you're<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.920> get<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
like I said then you're going to get the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.850 
like I said then you're going to get the
one<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.209> its<00:03:18.360> left<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.580> correct<00:03:20.820> spot<00:03:21.860> but

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
one to its left in the correct spot but

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.729 
one to its left in the correct spot but
flipped<00:03:23.280> around<00:03:23.430> or<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.540> cracks<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.140> solved

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
flipped around or in a cracks and solved

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.100 
flipped around or in a cracks and solved
um<00:03:26.180> so

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
um so

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.530 
um so
oh<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:30.310> more<00:03:30.400> thing<00:03:30.460> what<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.210> algorithm

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
oh one more thing what this algorithm

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.350 
oh one more thing what this algorithm
does<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:33.010> move<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.520> only<00:03:33.760> moves<00:03:34.030> these

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
does is it move it only moves these

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.920 
does is it move it only moves these
three<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:36.150> kind<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.450> moving

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
three in kind of a moving

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.960 
three in kind of a moving
counterclockwise<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.310> one<00:03:39.460> was<00:03:39.670> this

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
counterclockwise so this one was this

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.780 
counterclockwise so this one was this
one<00:03:40.150> goes<00:03:40.420> here<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.960> one<00:03:41.110> goes<00:03:41.260> here<00:03:41.500> and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
one goes here this one goes here and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.050 
one goes here this one goes here and
this<00:03:42.790> one<00:03:43.030> goes<00:03:43.240> back<00:03:43.420> here<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:44.850> if<00:03:45.850> you

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
this one goes back here and if you

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.850 
this one goes back here and if you
notice<00:03:46.210> I<00:03:46.600> didn't<00:03:47.050> say<00:03:47.080> anything<00:03:47.440> about<00:03:47.560> this

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
notice I didn't say anything about this

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.430 
notice I didn't say anything about this
one<00:03:48.070> well<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:49.090> algorithm<00:03:49.420> correct<00:03:50.230> and

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
one well this algorithm correct and

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.840 
one well this algorithm correct and
creates<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.190> safe<00:03:51.670> zone<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.840> safe<00:03:53.110> zone<00:03:53.350> is

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
creates a safe zone and the safe zone is

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.110 
creates a safe zone and the safe zone is
right<00:03:54.850> here<00:03:55.709> well<00:03:56.709> um<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.580> one<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.060> one

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
right here well um this one and this one

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.390 
right here well um this one and this one
will<00:03:58.990> not<00:03:59.050> be<00:03:59.350> affected<00:03:59.770> by<00:03:59.890> the<00:03:59.950> algorithm

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
will not be affected by the algorithm

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.730 
will not be affected by the algorithm
which<00:04:00.730> means<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.450> you're<00:04:02.230> trying<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.620> get

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
which means that you're trying to get

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.040 
which means that you're trying to get
the<00:04:03.190> corner<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:04.240> are<00:04:04.300> trying<00:04:04.510> at<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.810> corner

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
the corner you are trying at this corner

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.470 
the corner you are trying at this corner
to<00:04:05.170> be<00:04:05.620> correct<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.820> have<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.030> make<00:04:07.180> sure<00:04:07.209> that

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
to be correct you have to make sure that

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.010 
to be correct you have to make sure that
this<00:04:07.780> corner<00:04:08.230> does<00:04:08.980> not<00:04:09.250> belong<00:04:09.760> over<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.360> or

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
this corner does not belong over here or

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.840 
this corner does not belong over here or
else<00:04:11.200> when<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.620> do<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.860> algorithm<00:04:12.220> starting

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
else when you do the algorithm starting

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.750 
else when you do the algorithm starting
right<00:04:13.090> here<00:04:13.500> new<00:04:14.500> jet<00:04:14.709> on<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.310> will<00:04:15.459> just<00:04:15.580> move

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
right here new jet on it will just move

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.069 
right here new jet on it will just move
these<00:04:15.880> three<00:04:16.090> around<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.570> you'll<00:04:16.900> get

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
these three around and you'll get

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.500 
these three around and you'll get
nowhere<00:04:17.230> so<00:04:17.769> let's<00:04:18.220> check<00:04:19.440> green<00:04:20.440> purple

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
nowhere so let's check green purple

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.800 
nowhere so let's check green purple
white<00:04:22.510> sea<00:04:23.380> green<00:04:23.860> purple<00:04:24.250> go<00:04:24.820> okay<00:04:25.390> that's

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
white sea green purple go okay that's

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.090 
white sea green purple go okay that's
good<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:26.950> we<00:04:27.160> don't<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:29.260> corner<00:04:29.770> brown

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
good so we don't so the corner brown

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.310 
good so we don't so the corner brown
shirt<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.550> not<00:04:30.730> in<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.970> safe<00:04:31.180> zone<00:04:31.320> somewhere

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
shirt is not in a safe zone somewhere

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.110 
shirt is not in a safe zone somewhere
here<00:04:32.919> in<00:04:33.100> their<00:04:33.580> faces<00:04:33.760> here<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.530> I'm<00:04:36.490> just<00:04:36.970> in

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
here in their faces here so I'm just in

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.230 
here in their faces here so I'm just in
case<00:04:37.330> if<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:40.020> if<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.229> were<00:04:41.380> in<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.950> safe<00:04:42.160> zone

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
case if the if it were in the safe zone

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.000 
case if the if it were in the safe zone
but<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.390> would<00:04:43.510> have<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.720> deal<00:04:43.990> semi<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
but you would have to deal semi in a

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.570 
but you would have to deal semi in a
system

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.780 

okay<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.910> see<00:04:53.090> um<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:54.920> a<00:04:54.950> person<00:04:55.520> we<00:04:55.670> were

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
okay you see um this is a person we were

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.490 
okay you see um this is a person we were
starting<00:04:56.030> with<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.540> we<00:04:57.350> need<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:59.260> make<00:05:00.260> the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
starting with and we need to make the

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.340 
starting with and we need to make the
arse<00:05:01.190> all<00:05:01.880> for<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.270> second<00:05:02.630> one<00:05:02.750> which<00:05:03.320> is

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
arse all for the second one which is

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.580 
arse all for the second one which is
which<00:05:03.950> will<00:05:04.190> be<00:05:04.310> this<00:05:04.430> one<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:05.530> when<00:05:06.530> you

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
which will be this one and when you

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.040 
which will be this one and when you
started<00:05:06.890> here<00:05:07.070> nogaro<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.330> this<00:05:08.660> will<00:05:08.930> be

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
started here nogaro and this will be

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.870 
started here nogaro and this will be
your<00:05:09.200> safe<00:05:09.380> zone<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:09.890> this<00:05:10.040> corner<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.790> a

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
your safe zone so this corner is in a

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.850 
your safe zone so this corner is in a
safe<00:05:11.030> zone<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.660> it's<00:05:12.410> still<00:05:12.620> one<00:05:12.740> that

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
safe zone and it's still one that

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.100 
safe zone and it's still one that
belongs<00:05:13.100> here<00:05:13.340> so<00:05:13.910> that's<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.450> that's<00:05:14.900> no

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
belongs here so that's and that's no

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.720 
belongs here so that's and that's no
good<00:05:15.320> we're<00:05:15.980> going<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.220> have<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.460> use<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
good we're going to have to use the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.120 
good we're going to have to use the
algorithm<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.480> move<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.560> move<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:18.890> I

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
algorithm to move this to move this I

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.750 
algorithm to move this to move this I
here<00:05:19.640> and<00:05:19.850> move<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.480> back<00:05:20.660> here<00:05:20.980> so<00:05:21.980> if<00:05:22.700> you

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
here and move it back here so if you

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.870 
here and move it back here so if you
start<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.720> algorithm<00:05:24.050> on<00:05:24.140> here<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.820> this<00:05:25.820> is

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
start the algorithm on here and this is

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.400 
start the algorithm on here and this is
it's<00:05:26.240> in<00:05:26.390> a<00:05:26.420> safe<00:05:26.600> zone<00:05:26.660> so<00:05:27.020> nothing<00:05:27.320> will

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
it's in a safe zone so nothing will

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.810 
it's in a safe zone so nothing will
happen<00:05:27.740> so<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.010> need<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.280> choose<00:05:28.400> another

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
happen so you need to choose another

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.950 
happen so you need to choose another
corner<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.770> choose<00:05:31.400> this<00:05:31.550> one<00:05:31.730> because<00:05:32.240> if<00:05:32.750> we

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
corner so choose this one because if we

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.380 
corner so choose this one because if we
now<00:05:33.710> room<00:05:33.950> will<00:05:34.190> creep<00:05:34.490> make<00:05:34.730> this<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.270> it

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
now room will creep make this and it

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.970 
now room will creep make this and it
will<00:05:35.630> mate<00:05:36.110> we'll<00:05:36.350> put<00:05:36.590> this<00:05:36.710> in<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:36.950> safe

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
will mate we'll put this in the safe

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.160 
will mate we'll put this in the safe
zone<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:37.640> it<00:05:38.000> won't<00:05:38.180> be<00:05:38.270> affected<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.840> these

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
zone so it won't be affected and these

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.610 
zone so it won't be affected and these
three<00:05:39.440> will<00:05:39.620> move<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:40.370> see<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.880> that's<00:05:41.620> good

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
three will move you see and that's good

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.400 
three will move you see and that's good
because<00:05:43.600> we're<00:05:44.600> trying<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:44.840> move<00:05:44.990> this<00:05:45.110> out<00:05:45.290> of

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
because we're trying to move this out of

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.460 
because we're trying to move this out of
the<00:05:45.500> way<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:46.900> we're<00:05:47.900> trying<00:05:48.140> to<00:05:48.200> keep<00:05:48.290> this

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
the way and we're trying to keep this

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.220 
the way and we're trying to keep this
how<00:05:48.650> it<00:05:48.800> was<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:49.340> since<00:05:49.880> it's<00:05:50.060> since<00:05:50.720> it's<00:05:51.080> in

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
how it was and since it's since it's in

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.940 
how it was and since it's since it's in
a<00:05:51.290> safe<00:05:51.470> zone<00:05:51.530> that's<00:05:52.070> good<00:05:52.480> so<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:54.620> is<00:05:54.650> just

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
a safe zone that's good so this is just

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.580 
a safe zone that's good so this is just
in<00:05:55.130> case<00:05:55.310> this<00:05:55.940> is<00:05:56.120> just<00:05:56.660> if<00:05:57.110> you<00:05:57.350> have<00:05:57.470> the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
in case this is just if you have the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.850 
in case this is just if you have the
case<00:05:57.860> where<00:05:58.160> the<00:05:58.760> corner<00:05:59.540> next<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.290> the<00:06:00.500> left

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
case where the corner next to the left

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.159 
case where the corner next to the left
of<00:06:01.040> your<00:06:01.280> first<00:06:01.700> house<00:06:01.910> one<00:06:02.180> is<00:06:02.419> in<00:06:02.900> a<00:06:02.990> safe

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
of your first house one is in a safe

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.070 
of your first house one is in a safe
zone<00:06:03.230> so<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:05.180> use<00:06:05.510> algorithm<00:06:06.110> you<00:06:06.919> two<00:06:07.460> are

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
zone so you use algorithm you two are

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.120 
zone so you use algorithm you two are
you<00:06:09.080> I<00:06:09.110> 2<00:06:09.460> l.i<00:06:10.460> you<00:06:10.940> two<00:06:11.300> are<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:12.669> you<00:06:13.669> I<00:06:13.700> 20<00:06:15.130> and

now<00:06:16.750> that<00:06:17.750> corner<00:06:18.110> this<00:06:18.380> corner<00:06:18.440> is<00:06:18.919> out<00:06:19.160> of

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
now that corner this corner is out of

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.800 
now that corner this corner is out of
the<00:06:19.400> safe<00:06:19.610> zone<00:06:19.790> and<00:06:20.000> it's<00:06:20.210> safe<00:06:20.450> to<00:06:20.660> go<00:06:20.780> back

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
the safe zone and it's safe to go back

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.100 
the safe zone and it's safe to go back
to<00:06:21.440> your<00:06:22.130> original<00:06:22.370> corner<00:06:22.940> do<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.479> with<00:06:23.720> my

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
so you two are you I 20 you to buy are

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.650 
so you two are you I 20 you to buy are
you<00:06:40.560> two<00:06:40.740> are<00:06:41.610> I<00:06:41.670> you<00:06:41.790> to<00:06:42.330> oh<00:06:44.060> now<00:06:45.060> we<00:06:45.120> have<00:06:45.480> it

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
you two are I you to oh now we have it

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.260 
you two are I you to oh now we have it
now<00:06:46.050> this<00:06:46.260> is<00:06:46.410> it<00:06:46.590> now<00:06:46.860> this<00:06:47.220> is<00:06:47.400> salt<00:06:47.670> this<00:06:48.150> is

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
now this is it now this is salt this is

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.780 
now this is it now this is salt this is
solved<00:06:48.600> and<00:06:48.770> all<00:06:49.770> we<00:06:49.950> need<00:06:50.130> is<00:06:50.430> the<00:06:50.610> last

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
solved and all we need is the last

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.950 
solved and all we need is the last
string<00:06:51.060> so<00:06:52.460> in<00:06:53.460> order<00:06:53.610> to<00:06:53.850> switch<00:06:54.300> these<00:06:54.690> three

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
string so in order to switch these three

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.960 
string so in order to switch these three
around<00:06:55.260> we're<00:06:55.890> going<00:06:56.100> to<00:06:56.510> move<00:06:57.510> it<00:06:57.720> move<00:06:57.990> the

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
around we're going to move it move the

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.290 
around we're going to move it move the
mailings<00:06:59.970> to<00:07:00.660> our<00:07:00.780> left<00:07:01.140> and<00:07:02.180> start<00:07:03.180> the

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
mailings to our left and start the

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.930 
mailings to our left and start the
algorithm<00:07:03.480> on<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:04.860> corner<00:07:05.250> we<00:07:05.370> just<00:07:05.610> solved

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
algorithm on the corner we just solved

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.810 
algorithm on the corner we just solved
so<00:07:06.390> it's<00:07:06.990> okay<00:07:07.230> because<00:07:07.440> we<00:07:08.130> were<00:07:08.190> this<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:08.700> in

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
so it's okay because we were this is in

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.340 
so it's okay because we were this is in
a<00:07:08.880> safe<00:07:09.060> zone<00:07:09.120> and<00:07:09.540> it'll<00:07:09.840> just<00:07:09.870> move<00:07:10.230> these

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
a safe zone and it'll just move these

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.420 
a safe zone and it'll just move these
three<00:07:10.590> run<00:07:10.850> so<00:07:11.850> you<00:07:12.300> still<00:07:12.570> are<00:07:13.430> you

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
three run so you still are you

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:20.020 
three run so you still are you
eye-to-eye<00:07:15.650> youtube<00:07:16.650> or<00:07:16.920> I<00:07:17.000> you<00:07:18.000> two<00:07:18.240> are<00:07:19.230> you

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
eye-to-eye youtube or I you two are you

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.220 
eye-to-eye youtube or I you two are you
all<00:07:21.030> right<00:07:21.240> see<00:07:22.140> now<00:07:22.740> all<00:07:23.370> we<00:07:23.520> have<00:07:23.640> to<00:07:23.700> do<00:07:23.880> is

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
all right see now all we have to do is

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.170 
all right see now all we have to do is
permute<00:07:25.230> the<00:07:26.100> last<00:07:26.250> thing<00:07:26.490> or<00:07:26.760> put<00:07:27.000> them<00:07:27.060> in

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
permute the last thing or put them in

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.510 
permute the last thing or put them in
the<00:07:27.240> correct<00:07:27.420> place<00:07:27.660> and<00:07:28.160> first<00:07:29.160> time<00:07:29.370> you

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
the correct place and first time you

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.490 
the correct place and first time you
just<00:07:29.760> you<00:07:30.150> just<00:07:30.180> use<00:07:30.600> your<00:07:30.630> right<00:07:31.050> inverted

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
just you just use your right inverted

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.530 
just you just use your right inverted
downwards<00:07:32.310> it<00:07:32.430> right<00:07:32.610> down<00:07:32.790> algorithm<00:07:33.270> and

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
downwards it right down algorithm and

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.730 
downwards it right down algorithm and
you'll<00:07:34.260> until<00:07:35.010> the<00:07:35.940> corners<00:07:36.270> go<00:07:36.720> to<00:07:37.290> purple<00:07:37.650> on

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
you'll until the corners go to purple on

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.070 
you'll until the corners go to purple on
top<00:07:37.920> just<00:07:38.730> like<00:07:38.850> I<00:07:38.940> threw<00:07:39.150> my<00:07:39.240> face<00:07:39.450> this<00:07:39.930> is

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
top just like I threw my face this is

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.140 
top just like I threw my face this is
the<00:07:40.170> last<00:07:40.320> all<00:07:40.950> right<00:07:41.310> we're<00:07:41.520> done<00:07:41.760> rode<00:07:42.030> it

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
the last all right we're done rode it

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.600 
the last all right we're done rode it
right<00:07:43.070> all<00:07:44.070> right<00:07:44.250> see<00:07:44.880> I<00:07:45.140> rd<00:07:46.140> then<00:07:46.800> just<00:07:47.130> trim

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.610 
right all right see I rd then just trim

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.240 
right all right see I rd then just trim
another<00:07:47.820> on<00:07:48.120> South<00:07:48.390> corner<00:07:48.720> and<00:07:49.080> get<00:07:49.860> deep

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.250 
another on South corner and get deep

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:59.510 
another on South corner and get deep
algorithm

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.870 

then<00:08:00.520> just<00:08:00.730> take<00:08:01.600> the<00:08:01.810> rest<00:08:02.430> notice<00:08:03.430> never

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:03.880 
then just take the rest notice never

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.060 
then just take the rest notice never
have<00:08:04.060> it<00:08:04.210> it's<00:08:04.510> soft<00:08:04.900> and<00:08:05.169> I<00:08:05.350> hope<00:08:05.530> this<00:08:05.710> helped

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.070 
have it it's soft and I hope this helped

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.810 
have it it's soft and I hope this helped
