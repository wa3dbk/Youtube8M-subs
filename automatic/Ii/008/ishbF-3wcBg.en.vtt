00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello welcome back to the ces of las vegas 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.710
 we have an interesting product for the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.199
 lovers of greenery and gardening 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 it's called blog.com is created on the coast 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.390
 rica and is a weather station 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.109
 connects a service via the internet 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.510
 cloud that allows you to monitor the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 local weather and according to conditions 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.640
 dispense water from your area with i 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 own normal home sprinklers 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 in a condition dependent manner 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.899
 weather and not simply based on a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.360
 elementary timer for what happens 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.760
 often in our gardens than ours 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.690
 water timer even if it is raining 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.690
 maybe even for three consecutive days 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 so there is a huge waste of water that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 according to the block maker 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.800
 especially in the united states is the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.140
 main cause of water waste 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.690
 public before ever 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.210
 these exact service 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.000
 the product is supplied with in the version 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.100
 base a power line that serves for 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.320
 connect it if we don't have a wifi in the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 area where our sprinklers arrive and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.119
 or if we have a craving 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.130
 available at its internal point 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.680
 practically as it happens you connect the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.210
 home line and then if they have access 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.789
 to the cloud service that was a leader in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.220
 action at this time and for each 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.979
 of their sprinklers because they 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.899
 can manage up to 12 we can 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.750
 go to select via an app or 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.119
 via the cloud service which kind of 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.460
 plants we connected to that 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.060
 specific irrigator the indication yes 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.429
 connects to one of these hooks e 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.399
 practically from that moment onwards not 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.280
 we will use a simple timer but it will be 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.800
 blossom to supply water when needed 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.750
 if needed and in the right quantities in the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.450
 in case a single sprinkler does not have a 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.539
 only type of plants but more types 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.729
 in the same line we say is the case of 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.170
 set is a quantity of water 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.239
 the greater compared to the heart of the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 selected plants the question I have 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.510
 fact was that it happens if it is no longer 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.430
 optical internet of the collection as 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 it often happens to some of ours 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.220
 unfortunate Italian friends is simple 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.380
 system takes an average of the last 10 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.209
 12 days and continues to irrigate like a 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.040
 timer is simply wanted does this 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.670
 what here our plants do not 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.980
 will die 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.959
 according to our Costa Rican friends among 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.010
 the other the product is having a big one 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.810
 success 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.920
 despite the price not exactly 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.540
 available for around $ 200 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.900
