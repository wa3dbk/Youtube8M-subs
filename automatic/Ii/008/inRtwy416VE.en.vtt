to be yet I'm hoping it'll be between 4

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.420 
to be yet I'm hoping it'll be between 4
to<00:01:14.630> 8<00:01:14.900> which<00:01:15.470> would<00:01:15.680> be<00:01:15.770> really<00:01:15.980> awesome<00:01:16.220> to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
to 8 which would be really awesome to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.220 
to 8 which would be really awesome to
see<00:01:16.730> because<00:01:16.940> in<00:01:17.180> zombies<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:17.720> only<00:01:17.840> usually

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
see because in zombies we only usually

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.230 
see because in zombies we only usually
have<00:01:18.380> four<00:01:18.650> players<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> max<00:01:19.550> but<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.120> have

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
have four players to the max but to have

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.850 
have four players to the max but to have
eight<00:01:20.480> players<00:01:20.870> would<00:01:21.140> be<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> really<00:01:21.620> good

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
eight players would be a really good

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.070 
eight players would be a really good
idea<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.730> definitely<00:01:23.000> recommend<00:01:23.360> them

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
idea and I definitely recommend them

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.720 
idea and I definitely recommend them
doing<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.470> because<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.920> lot<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.250> people<00:01:25.370> would

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
doing that because a lot of people would

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.490 
doing that because a lot of people would
be<00:01:25.850> happy<00:01:25.880> with<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.480> now<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.930> next<00:01:27.110> one<00:01:27.260> we

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
be happy with it now the next one we

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.950 
be happy with it now the next one we
have<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.250> loading<00:01:28.520> screen<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:29.390> extension

now<00:01:34.160> believe<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:34.790> going<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.180> be<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.510> lot<00:01:35.930> of

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
now believe there's going to be a lot of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.600 
now believe there's going to be a lot of
different<00:01:36.080> types<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.710> these<00:01:36.860> aliens<00:01:37.370> in<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
different types of these aliens in the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.310 
different types of these aliens in the
game<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.060> believe<00:01:38.540> there's<00:01:38.720> also<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.230> be

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
game I believe there's also going to be

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.380 
game I believe there's also going to be
a<00:01:39.560> lot<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:39.920> objectives<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.670> which<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.180> guys

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
a lot of objectives in which you guys

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.420 
a lot of objectives in which you guys
can<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.020> complete<00:01:42.350> challenges<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:43.070> I'm

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
can do and complete challenges and I'm

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.550 
can do and complete challenges and I'm
pretty<00:01:43.670> sure<00:01:43.910> there<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.180> also<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.750> custom<00:01:45.320> class

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
pretty sure there is also a custom class

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.410 
pretty sure there is also a custom class
setup<00:01:46.010> sort<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.340> thing<00:01:46.520> when<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.270> make

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
your own custom classes and then jump

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.030 
your own custom classes and then jump
into<00:01:49.850> battle<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.600> fight<00:01:50.870> these<00:01:51.080> alien<00:01:51.620> swarms

progress that is some sort of challenge

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.990 
progress that is some sort of challenge
as<00:02:24.290> well<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:24.980> looks<00:02:25.159> pretty<00:02:25.250> awesome<00:02:25.610> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
as well so that looks pretty awesome and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.670 
as well so that looks pretty awesome and
I<00:02:26.090> really<00:02:26.120> want<00:02:26.659> to<00:02:26.720> try<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:26.989> map<00:02:27.319> out<00:02:27.530> for

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
I really want to try this map out for

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.289 
I really want to try this map out for
myself<00:02:27.799> now<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.489> guys<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.909> see<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.150> looks

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
myself now you guys can see it looks

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.880 
myself now you guys can see it looks
like<00:02:29.480> there's<00:02:29.659> some<00:02:29.810> sort<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.110> killstreak<00:02:30.739> or

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
like there's some sort of killstreak or

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.250 
like there's some sort of killstreak or
rewards<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.909> can<00:02:32.150> use<00:02:32.450> when<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.049> get<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
rewards that you can use when you get a

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.380 
rewards that you can use when you get a
certain<00:02:33.620> amount<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.920> points<00:02:34.129> using<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.849> d-pad

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
certain amount of points using the d-pad

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.149 
certain amount of points using the d-pad
that<00:02:35.840> looks<00:02:36.049> pretty<00:02:36.319> interesting<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.980> well

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
that looks pretty interesting as well

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.800 
that looks pretty interesting as well
I'm<00:02:37.370> guessing<00:02:37.909> it's<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.299> be<00:02:38.420> similar<00:02:38.659> to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
I'm guessing it's going to be similar to

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 
I'm guessing it's going to be similar to
how<00:02:39.049> we<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.379> sort<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.739> killstreaks<00:02:40.310> online

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
how we have sort of killstreaks online

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.190 
how we have sort of killstreaks online
but<00:02:41.150> when<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.420> get<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.599> certain<00:02:41.930> amount<00:02:41.959> of

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
but when you get a certain amount of

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.380 
but when you get a certain amount of
points<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.680> can<00:02:42.890> redeem<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.489> points<00:02:43.700> into

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
points you can redeem the points into

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210 
points you can redeem the points into
getting<00:02:44.720> these<00:02:44.930> certain<00:02:45.290> rewards<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:46.010> can

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
getting these certain rewards that can

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.339 
getting these certain rewards that can
help<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.670> fight<00:02:47.090> against<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.750> extinction

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
help you fight against the extinction

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.110 
help you fight against the extinction
all<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.680> aliens<00:02:49.099> that<00:02:49.250> are<00:02:49.400> in<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.670> game<00:02:49.849> mode

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
all the aliens that are in the game mode

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.460 
all the aliens that are in the game mode
so<00:02:50.540> that's<00:02:50.720> pretty<00:02:50.930> much<00:02:51.109> all<00:02:51.319> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
so that's pretty much all the

as<00:02:56.989> well<00:02:57.019> as<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.470> teaser<00:02:57.709> for<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.670> game<00:02:58.940> mode

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
as well as the teaser for this game mode

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.089 
as well as the teaser for this game mode
now<00:02:59.420> also<00:02:59.660> just<00:03:00.079> notice<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.769> looks<00:03:00.920> like

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
now also just notice that it looks like

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.500 
now also just notice that it looks like
there<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.310> some<00:03:01.609> sort<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:01.879> skill<00:03:02.239> tree

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
there is some sort of skill tree

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.630 
there is some sort of skill tree
involved<00:03:03.049> with<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.799> game<00:03:04.010> as<00:03:04.190> well<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.549> I'm

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
involved with in the game as well so I'm

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.740 
involved with in the game as well so I'm
guessing<00:03:04.849> it's<00:03:05.150> probably<00:03:05.269> going<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.690> be

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
guessing it's probably going to be

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.449 
guessing it's probably going to be
mission<00:03:06.170> based<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:06.859> when<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.099> can<00:03:07.250> play<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
mission based so when you can play the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.069 
mission based so when you can play the
mission<00:03:07.909> you're<00:03:08.060> going<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.390> get<00:03:08.480> points<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
mission you're going to get points and

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.630 
mission you're going to get points and
you're<00:03:09.440> going<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.739> be<00:03:09.859> able<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.159> level<00:03:10.489> up<00:03:10.609> your

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
you're going to be able to level up your

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.420 
you're going to be able to level up your
skill<00:03:11.060> tree<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.840> increase<00:03:12.230> certain<00:03:12.650> stats<00:03:12.980> so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
skill tree to increase certain stats so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.979 
skill tree to increase certain stats so
it's<00:03:13.549> going<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.819> be<00:03:13.909> pretty<00:03:14.090> awesome<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:14.690> really

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
it's going to be pretty awesome I really

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.809 
it's going to be pretty awesome I really
can't<00:03:15.200> wait<00:03:15.349> for<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.590> game<00:03:15.799> mode<00:03:16.069> I'm<00:03:16.220> hoping

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.890 
it's going to top zombies or at least be

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
equivalent to it and especially if they

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.870 
equivalent to it and especially if they
did<00:03:21.109> add<00:03:21.319> that<00:03:21.530> four<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:21.889> eight<00:03:22.040> players<00:03:22.280> that
