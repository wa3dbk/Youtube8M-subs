you might even you know catch some of
the<00:03:58.590> ones<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:58.950> can't<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.760> bait<00:03:59.940> or

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
the ones that just can't see the bait or

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.150 
the ones that just can't see the bait or
you<00:04:00.329> know<00:04:00.450> using<00:04:00.810> their<00:04:01.049> lateral<00:04:01.380> lines<00:04:01.680> only

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
