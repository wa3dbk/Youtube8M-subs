00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
anything that's kind of like yellow

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.500 
anything that's kind of like yellow
orange<00:01:09.770> has<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.700> color<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.330> and

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
orange has that that color to it and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.820 
orange has that that color to it and
then<00:01:11.690> afterwards<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.320> want<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.500> put<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> crew

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
then afterwards you want to put the crew

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.420 
then afterwards you want to put the crew
color<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.250> there<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.210> creates<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.540> like

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
color on there so it creates this like

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.530 
color on there so it creates this like
when<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.460> look<00:01:16.610> at<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:16.970> look<00:01:17.120> at<00:01:17.210> like<00:01:17.360> I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
when I look at this I look at like I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.180 
when I look at this I look at like I
think<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.810> like<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.960> galaxy<00:01:18.380> or<00:01:18.530> something<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
think of like a galaxy or something and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.220 
think of like a galaxy or something and
like<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> just<00:01:19.910> like<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.060> star<00:01:20.510> beam<00:01:20.780> shooting

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.080 
like a just like a star beam shooting
across<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> galaxy<00:01:22.190> so<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.490> call<00:01:22.730> it<00:01:22.850> star

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
across the galaxy so I call it star

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.300 
across the galaxy so I call it star
