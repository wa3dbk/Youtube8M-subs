 because he used to plant people in times of slow race and sometimes the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 memory 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.050
 Soils not wasteland near fence is to blame 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.320
 however this plant 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.400
 it was in architectural movement features added 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.170
 currently murcia a plant that is very fashionable the plant 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.250
 and that is used in both tropical concepts and acts of this type 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.170
 as you know is minimalist 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.429
 and in a plant 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.470
 in common and easy care because 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.220
 efe in a succulent dinner on the floor that may be without water for a long time 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470
 but also put access 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.820
 apart from that but it is an economic alternative 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.840
 iruÃ±ea- plant 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.400
 it can spread very easily 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.000
 of one plant opted for percent and to go 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.280
 manages to have it kind 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.300
 so 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.280
 can be 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.040
 the most beautiful plant in the world as you can in the ugliest silver in the world 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.490
 everything depends on the use that is given 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.560
 the care and maintenance of a plant that requires 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 the elimination of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.160
 madrid plants 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.310
 to always keep the new vivid color dedicated to vital herbie that is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100
 superimpose if we let 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.990
 overlaps too much power what happens is that the eleven gets very long and 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.700
 plant 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.550
 lie down and then lose the effect 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.830
 characteristic 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.380
 it was fine after the species is high three phase 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.700
 because he has 3 phases three colors that he dressed in yellow that he wants 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 when nothing 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.500
 plant hello is still young is going to come by an interesting majadahonda coloring 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 let's see the gray tone of the yellow bull 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 those are the ones that we should efe 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.480
 p the mother plants are the old plants or the plants that have gone 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.930
 losing the colon or that for some reason have been deteriorating we wait 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.620
 that is burned that this event is a daughter 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.190
 that's why we're going to eliminate three zeros whenever we report making a cut 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.909
 cleansed 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.699
 the most stuck to the ground to avoid 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.349
 the one that is seen that there was human intervention
