the case that's on my phone and because

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
the case that's on my phone and because
the<00:02:45.330> way<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.690> cut<00:02:45.989> these<00:02:46.170> cases<00:02:46.769> now<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.160> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
the way they cut these cases now like I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.920 
the way they cut these cases now like I
said<00:02:47.310> story<00:02:47.850> i<00:02:47.940> should<00:02:48.180> actually<00:02:48.300> caveat<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
said story i should actually caveat to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.140 
said story i should actually caveat to
what<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.769> point<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.850> isn't

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
what I'm my point here it isn't

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.570 
what I'm my point here it isn't
necessarily<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> camera<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> ok

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
necessarily the camera because I ok

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.280 
necessarily the camera because I ok
maybe<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> flash<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> little<00:02:54.810> close<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
maybe the flash is a little close to the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.960 
maybe the flash is a little close to the
camera<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.739> let<00:02:56.010> me<00:02:56.160> know<00:02:56.280> what<00:02:56.459> do<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.670> think

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
camera you let me know what do you think

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
camera you let me know what do you think
you<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.239> photography<00:02:57.959> experts<00:02:58.380> out

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
you all have photography experts out

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
you all have photography experts out
there<00:02:59.060> I'm<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.730> were<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.030> hazard<00:03:03.209> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
there I'm not but if I were to hazard a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.699 
there I'm not but if I were to hazard a
guess<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:03.959> say<00:03:04.080> it's<00:03:04.230> because<00:03:04.410> that

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
guess I would say it's because that

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.410 
guess I would say it's because that
flash<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.250> too<00:03:05.400> close<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.940> camera<00:03:06.150> you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
flash is too close to the camera you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.940 
flash is too close to the camera you
know<00:03:06.510> if<00:03:06.600> they<00:03:06.750> put<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.170> flash<00:03:07.410> at<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.769> other

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
know if they put the flash at the other

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.670 
know if they put the flash at the other
side<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.459> camera<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.060> then<00:03:09.720> had<00:03:10.410> two

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
side of the camera and then had two

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.000 
side of the camera and then had two
holes<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> back<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.850> cases<00:03:12.329> then<00:03:13.260> you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
holes on the back of the cases then you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.560 
holes on the back of the cases then you
probably<00:03:14.250> wouldn't<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:14.910> same<00:03:15.329> problem

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
probably wouldn't get that same problem

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.150 
probably wouldn't get that same problem
you<00:03:16.110> wouldn't<00:03:16.380> get<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.530> flushed<00:03:16.980> out

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
you wouldn't get that flushed out

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.740 
you wouldn't get that flushed out
picture<00:03:17.610> now<00:03:17.790> i'm<00:03:17.940> going<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> post<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.540> picture

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750

my i found that if i'm going to have a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.110 
my i found that if i'm going to have a
case<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.110> my<00:03:25.260> phone<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> be<00:03:26.519> one<00:03:27.090> of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
case on my phone it's got to be one of

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
these bumpers and then I never run into

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.910 
these bumpers and then I never run into

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
that problem I don't so much run into it
