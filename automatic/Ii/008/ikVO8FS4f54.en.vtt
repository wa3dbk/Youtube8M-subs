you
the<00:00:50.390> idea<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:51.020> an<00:00:51.200> alien<00:00:51.620> invasion<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.340> an

the idea of an alien invasion of an

the idea of an alien invasion of an
alien<00:00:53.390> civilization<00:00:53.750> at<00:00:54.170> hacking<00:00:54.560> seems

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
alien civilization at hacking seems

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.310 
alien civilization at hacking seems
crazy<00:00:55.130> because<00:00:56.060> basically<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.960> idea<00:00:56.990> of

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
crazy because basically the idea of

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.820 
crazy because basically the idea of
aliens<00:00:57.530> seems<00:00:58.160> crazy<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.570> thing<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.830> the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
aliens seems crazy but the thing is the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.730 
aliens seems crazy but the thing is the
idea<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.430> an<00:01:02.240> alien<00:01:02.720> intelligent<00:01:03.500> species

idea of an alien intelligent species

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.310 
idea of an alien intelligent species
living<00:01:04.460> on<00:01:04.699> another<00:01:04.820> planet<00:01:05.120> really<00:01:05.990> isn't

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
living on another planet really isn't

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.490 
living on another planet really isn't
that<00:01:06.410> crazy<00:01:06.590> at<00:01:06.860> all<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:11.690> chance<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.260> there

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
that crazy at all the chance that there

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.730 
that crazy at all the chance that there
is<00:01:13.150> life<00:01:14.150> that<00:01:14.570> originally<00:01:15.260> evolved

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
is life that originally evolved

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.910 
is life that originally evolved
elsewhere<00:01:15.950> in<00:01:16.400> other<00:01:16.520> solar<00:01:16.760> systems<00:01:17.090> is

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
elsewhere in other solar systems is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.370 
elsewhere in other solar systems is
certainly<00:01:18.920> possible<00:01:19.300> there's<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.810> chance<00:01:21.200> that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
certainly possible there's a chance that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
certainly possible there's a chance that
some<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.100> life<00:01:22.430> became<00:01:23.300> intelligent

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.000 

I<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.659> there's<00:01:27.990> essentially<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.710> hundred

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
I think there's essentially a hundred

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.800 
I think there's essentially a hundred
percent<00:01:29.130> probability<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.180> there's<00:01:30.420> other

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
percent probability that there's other

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.800 
percent probability that there's other
life<00:01:31.080> even<00:01:31.920> within<00:01:32.100> our<00:01:32.310> galaxy<00:01:32.690> certainly<00:01:33.690> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
life even within our galaxy certainly in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.090 
life even within our galaxy certainly in
the<00:01:33.930> universe<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.530> universe<00:01:34.590> is

the universe the universe is

the universe the universe is
extraordinarily<00:01:35.640> huge<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:38.450> our<00:01:39.450> own<00:01:39.600> backyard

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
extraordinarily huge in our own backyard

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.620 
extraordinarily huge in our own backyard
there<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> hundred<00:01:41.220> billion<00:01:41.760> stars<00:01:41.940> in<00:01:42.479> the

there are a hundred billion stars in the

there are a hundred billion stars in the
Milky<00:01:42.690> Way<00:01:43.080> galaxy<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.460> our<00:01:45.360> telescopes<00:01:45.930> can

Milky Way galaxy and our telescopes can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
Milky Way galaxy and our telescopes can
see<00:01:46.470> perhaps<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> hundred<00:01:47.190> billion<00:01:47.910> galaxies

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

see perhaps a hundred billion galaxies
out<00:01:49.050> there<00:01:49.080> do<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> math<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.850> 10,000

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
out there do the math that's 10,000

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.390 
out there do the math that's 10,000
billion<00:01:52.500> billion<00:01:53.009> stars<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.130> that

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
billion billion stars and to think that

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.290 
billion billion stars and to think that
we<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:56.970> only<00:01:57.450> game<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:57.900> town<00:01:59.119> come<00:02:00.119> on

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
we are the only game in town come on

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.690 
we are the only game in town come on
that's<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.410> height<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:02.039> arrogance
