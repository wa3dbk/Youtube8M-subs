00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.429
 to 

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.840
 and now we're going to start doing that 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.899
 little game for digestion because there 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.960
 what indigestion and what belly pain 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.450
 because it always happens that we miss the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.919
 food hand especially the desktop 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.260
 I do not think it 's the most fattening 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.300
 Not that it's the richest thing, not because 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.760
 you remain the chacoteo and the or magicians but 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.280
 we always eat others and then there is no 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.010
 way to digest this liquefied is going to 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.900
 serve or before or after the meal 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.529
 so then write down the ingredients is 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.140
 delicate to the point we're going to need a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.530
 apple heartbroken and in pieces two 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 slices of thin pineapples one and a half 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.840
 cup of papaya in pieces and half a cup 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.630
 of clear water is if your blender is not 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.410
 dora flame maybe they do not need the 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.060
 water tín tín tín tín tín tín tín tín tín 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.370
 ale saints let's make this smoothie 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.590
 let's put some pineapple that the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.180
 pineapple use it a lot in india for 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.190
 soften the meat at first it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.899
 used as a way of conservation and 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.720
 then they realized that the meat was 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.570
 I softened chido and then they realize 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.150
 what 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.500
 the pineapple has an incredible property 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.240
 to make the digestion they ate 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.340
 meat they gave gave me satisfactions 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.490
 but when they ate it marinated in pineapple 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.979
 they never were as bloated and doing 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.479
 of the pineapple is very good to make the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.860
 digestion we are also going to add 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.080
 apple what's up with the apple has 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.000
 pectin on everything and good the pectin the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.150
 they will find in the pulp part 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.990
 and in the fiber part of the shell 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.870
 let's find an acid ok this acid 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 it's called sonic uriz and it serves to create 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.130
 but I want you to say what it is for 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 lose weight 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.750
 God want apple this is like in 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 apple please thank you we're going to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.110
 add also some papaya from the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.330
 Papaya is very good and has a lot 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.010
 fiber apart has papain that what 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.410
 does that make him a little 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.830
 lipid metabolism and also accelerates the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.510
 digestion 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.400
 here we have a lot of fiber for 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.530
 accelerate that digestion and that we do not 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.550
 drop weigh the food then there are leds 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.200
 and now we are going to pour this and we 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.200
