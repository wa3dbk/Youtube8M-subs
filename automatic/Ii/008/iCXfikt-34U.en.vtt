00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
usually like replay the feed levels that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.130 
usually like replay the feed levels that
I<00:02:43.959> plan<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.200> record<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.739> then<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.150> then<00:02:46.959> like

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
I plan to record and then and then like

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.979 
I plan to record and then and then like
go<00:02:47.260> into<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> but<00:02:47.739> um<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.310> just<00:02:48.879> decided<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.840> go

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
go into it but um I just decided to go

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.440 
go into it but um I just decided to go
into<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> blindly<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.709> time<00:02:50.890> because<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
into it blindly this time because I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.490 
into it blindly this time because I
thought<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.569> might<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:52.810> more<00:02:53.019> interesting<00:02:53.410> or

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
thought it might be more interesting or

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.430 
thought it might be more interesting or
some<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.599> graph<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.049> witches<00:02:56.319> or

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
some also have graph of witches or

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.170 
some also have graph of witches or
something<00:02:56.769> but<00:02:56.950> hopefully<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.060> won't

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
something but hopefully that won't

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.940 
something but hopefully that won't
happen<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.720> haven't<00:02:59.379> really<00:02:59.530> been<00:02:59.590> seeing<00:02:59.859> them

what I was talking about earlier in the
game<00:05:38.620> where<00:05:38.889> pretty<00:05:39.790> much<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.090> entire<00:05:40.360> plot

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
game where pretty much the entire plot

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.030 
game where pretty much the entire plot
is<00:05:40.870> driven<00:05:41.080> by<00:05:42.960> premise<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.050> entire<00:05:44.560> plot<00:05:44.800> is
