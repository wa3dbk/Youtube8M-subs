one has some insulating material on the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.990 
one has some insulating material on the
inside<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.950> see<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.490> real<00:02:34.850> nice

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
inside you see that some real nice

inside you see that some real nice
insulating<00:02:35.480> material<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:36.140> helps<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:36.590> just

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
insulating material that helps not just

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.040 
insulating material that helps not just
with<00:02:37.100> temperature<00:02:37.670> that's<00:02:38.600> not<00:02:38.780> as<00:02:38.870> big<00:02:39.020> a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
with temperature that's not as big a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.440 
with temperature that's not as big a
concern<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.709> me<00:02:40.000> even<00:02:41.000> though<00:02:41.060> we're<00:02:41.209> here<00:02:41.330> in

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
concern for me even though we're here in

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
concern for me even though we're here in
Texas<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.320> really<00:02:42.440> helps<00:02:42.739> with<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.920> sound

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
Texas but it really helps with the sound

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.590 
Texas but it really helps with the sound
because<00:02:43.580> you've<00:02:43.700> got<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.820> lot<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.060> reflection

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
because you've got a lot of reflection

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.540 
because you've got a lot of reflection
of<00:02:44.690> sound<00:02:44.870> off<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.500> windshield<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.370> off

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
of sound off of the windshield and off

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.120 
of sound off of the windshield and off
of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.910> top<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.390> by<00:02:47.570> having<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.870> material<00:02:48.650> on

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
of the top so by having that material on

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.650 
of the top so by having that material on
there<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.370> really<00:02:49.610> helps<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.060> sound<00:02:50.420> and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
there it really helps with the sound and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.690 
there it really helps with the sound and
keeping<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.019> quiet<00:02:51.230> inside<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.709> machine<00:02:51.980> this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
keeping it quiet inside the machine this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.910 
keeping it quiet inside the machine this
has<00:02:52.940> an<00:02:53.180> aftermarket<00:02:53.690> accessory<00:02:54.470> windshield

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
that lift kit yeah that's a little hard

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.990

to<00:03:57.810> see

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
to see

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.570 
to see
now<00:04:00.000> lift<00:04:00.240> kit<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.690> just<00:04:00.960> this<00:04:01.860> bracket<00:04:02.430> right

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
now lift kit is just this bracket right

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.720 
now lift kit is just this bracket right
here<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:04.260> across<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:04.860> side<00:04:05.040> so

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
here going across to the side so

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.430 
here going across to the side so
originally<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.420> shock<00:04:06.690> mounted<00:04:07.200> right<00:04:07.380> here

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
originally the shock mounted right here

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.540 
originally the shock mounted right here
and<00:04:07.920> now<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.340> mounts<00:04:08.670> here<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:10.550> it's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
and now it mounts here so it's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.980 
and now it mounts here so it's
essentially<00:04:12.000> what<00:04:12.120> we<00:04:12.240> get<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.600> lift<00:04:12.750> kit
