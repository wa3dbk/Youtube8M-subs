00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
minutes so that it cools down slightly

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.630 
minutes so that it cools down slightly
and<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.420> will<00:02:22.900> be<00:02:23.050> easier<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.650> me<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.250> handle

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and that will be easier for me to handle

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.240 
and that will be easier for me to handle
it<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.600> can<00:02:25.780> see<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.230> not<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.800> soft

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it as you can see it's not like a soft

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.270 
it as you can see it's not like a soft
dough<00:02:27.520> like<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:28.000> make<00:02:28.660> for<00:02:28.930> chapatis<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.130> it's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
dough like we make for chapatis so it's

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.610 
dough like we make for chapatis so it's
been<00:02:30.490> about<00:02:30.610> five<00:02:31.000> minutes<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:32.380> mixture

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
been about five minutes and the mixture

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.410 
been about five minutes and the mixture
has<00:02:32.800> slightly<00:02:33.400> cooled<00:02:33.640> down<00:02:33.850> look<00:02:34.150> at<00:02:34.240> this

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
has slightly cooled down look at this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.990 
has slightly cooled down look at this
it's<00:02:34.630> like<00:02:34.750> crumble<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.920> like<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.160> dough

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
it's like crumble it's not like a dough

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's like crumble it's not like a dough
so<00:02:37.300> I'm<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.080> going<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.350> take<00:02:38.620> small<00:02:39.250> portion

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
so I'm just going to take small portion

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880 
so I'm just going to take small portion
out<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.300> dough<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.750> get<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.470> onto<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
out of this dough and get it onto the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.250 
out of this dough and get it onto the
work<00:02:42.100> surface<00:02:42.340> I'm<00:02:43.330> just<00:02:43.570> going<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.870> knead<00:02:44.230> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
work surface I'm just going to knead it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.630 
work surface I'm just going to knead it
till<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.550> very<00:02:45.970> very<00:02:46.330> soft<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.640> smooth

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
till I get a very very soft and smooth

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.630 
till I get a very very soft and smooth
dough<00:02:49.239> out<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.890> we'll<00:02:50.890> lightly<00:02:51.280> sprinkle

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
dough out of it we'll lightly sprinkle

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.130 
dough out of it we'll lightly sprinkle
some<00:02:52.000> water<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:53.489> knead<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:55.390> make<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.810> very

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
some water and knead to make a very

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.750 
some water and knead to make a very
smooth<00:02:56.620> ball<00:02:57.340> out<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:59.370> make<00:03:00.370> sure<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.580> you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
smooth ball out of it make sure that you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:23.320 
smooth ball out of it make sure that you
need<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.330> very<00:03:01.750> well

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.570 

so<00:03:24.140> once<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.500> get<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.680> soft<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.160> out<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.400> it

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
so once you get a soft you out of it

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.690 
so once you get a soft you out of it
just<00:03:26.420> shape<00:03:27.020> it<00:03:27.230> into<00:03:27.410> 2-inch<00:03:28.450> lock<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.700> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
just shape it into 2-inch lock and the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.210 
just shape it into 2-inch lock and the
length<00:03:31.910> should<00:03:32.450> be<00:03:32.630> about<00:03:33.290> six<00:03:33.740> inches

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
length should be about six inches

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.390 
length should be about six inches
because<00:03:35.030> we<00:03:35.300> are<00:03:35.390> going<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.870> press<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:37.130> dough

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
because we are going to press this dough

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.250 
because we are going to press this dough
in<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.300> shape<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:39.190> some<00:03:40.190> spirals<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:41.110> drop<00:03:42.110> it

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
in the shape of some spirals and drop it

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.830 
in the shape of some spirals and drop it
into<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.620> hot<00:03:42.800> oil<00:03:42.830> for<00:03:43.280> deep-frying<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:44.660> for

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
into the hot oil for deep-frying so for

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.600 
into the hot oil for deep-frying so for
pressing<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.230> dough<00:03:45.500> we<00:03:45.890> need<00:03:46.070> this<00:03:46.220> miroku

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
pressing the dough we need this miroku

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.880 
pressing the dough we need this miroku
maker<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:47.450> have<00:03:47.480> two<00:03:47.810> attachments<00:03:48.530> for<00:03:48.680> this

I'm going to press it onto the plastic

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.820 
I'm going to press it onto the plastic
bag<00:04:45.690> basically<00:04:46.690> I'm<00:04:46.780> using<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.200> ziplock<00:04:47.590> bag

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
bag basically I'm using the ziplock bag

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.690 
bag basically I'm using the ziplock bag
and<00:04:48.330> make<00:04:49.330> sure<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:50.440> make<00:04:50.680> just<00:04:51.460> one

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
and make sure that you make just one

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.810 
and make sure that you make just one

otherwise<00:04:55.300> they<00:04:55.870> are<00:04:55.960> going<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.260> split<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:57.040> the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
otherwise they are going to split in the

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.300
