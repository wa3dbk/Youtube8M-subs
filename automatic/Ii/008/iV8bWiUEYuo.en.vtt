00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.360
 hi friends 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.530
 tonight I bring you the unboxing of 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.010
 processor 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:19.880
 intel core i5 the 2400 what is that 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.310
 we found here is 11 55 this 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.039
 processor is a four processor 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.560
 nuclei does not have hyper training 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.629
 this teacher comes with a card 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 graphic integrated to the hd 2000 is 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.960
 lower processing to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 amd apu processors but this one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.489
 processor has a performance and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.050
 performance in processing very 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.739
 superior to app processors 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.760
 possibly depending on the form of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.100
 work but that we find here as 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 as main features is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 from four cores and has the inter 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.680
 turbo cache 2.0 hd graphics 2000 the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.700
 smart cache 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.049
 integrates an integrated memory 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.930
 it has supports dual channel ddr3 and has 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.490
 3 years warranty I will see what is it 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 that we found inside the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.820
 box 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.000
 and what we are going to find inside 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.000
 It is the following 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.230
 how can you tell 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.230
 this is the heatsink 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.610
 it's a pretty small district I think 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.610
 which is a 40-millimeter search engine 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.910
 As you can see, it's pretty 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.490
 great 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:25.980
 this is a 95 watt processor 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:28.110
 of consumer thought that the heatsink wm 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.060
 the processor controls the speed of the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.730
 bread 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.700
 we have the plastic connectors that are 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.800
 the most dangerous a minimum of pasta 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.800
 thermal to maximize 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.690
 heat transfer from the heatsink 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.580
 we see what 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.480
 the aluminum that we used in this 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.400
 case is much smaller but in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.520
 change in the case of md is a bit more 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.750
 high consumption that this must have a 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.930
 best 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.930
 heat transfer rate 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.030
 and here we find the processor 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.960
 he sandy bridge 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.340
 and 52 thousand 400 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.560
 we have the speed of 3.1 giga hertz 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 they can not realize on the other side to 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.130
 difference of the processors 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:53.130
 of md that have light or legs in this 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.740
 case not of almengor comes with legs 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.740
 to make them the connection to the interface 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.000
 inside the box we find the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.510
 Installation guide and warranty and for 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.510
 latest 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.980
 simple 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.590
 twenty 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.709
 this is what we find inside 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.709
 of the heatsink processor box 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.450
 and the box that contains them 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.380
 good friends, I hope you liked it 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:39.700
 my an intel and core processor boxing 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:42.880
 5 the 2400 that since 11 55 and yes 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.310
 I have any questions I'll see 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.289
 put with a major 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.960
 the Celtic 68 m 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.469
 and I'm going to do choosing overclocking 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.699
 to see how this processor works and 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.699
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.200
 thanks for coming
