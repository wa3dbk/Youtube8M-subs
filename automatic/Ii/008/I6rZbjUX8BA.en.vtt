00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 and lets pass can not no 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.849
 so began the commitment in the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.970
 stadium second aranda towers with this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.480
 pretense of melgar just started the 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.480
 commitment 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:22.270
 so the box responded 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.190
 of pacific with this cantor center and 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.110
 the clay hand and the very clear hand do not 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.540
 I think the penalties have been 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.260
 determinants now yesterday by 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.320
 alliances to decide not that when the 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.730
 defense goes out has intercepted through 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.830
 a ball you have to be with your hands 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.379
 that shortens the trajectory of the ball 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.910
 as if before raising your hand they have 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.680
 to be cutting just what 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.440
 we call the wrong ball trajectory 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 singing kicked it did not too bad the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.239
 shoot normally strong wanted 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.530
 place them and merit the butrón that could 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.390
 tackle is that value is not what we see 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.430
 and the second shot that makes us go 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.140
 to go later also 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.950
 guess is not from the free kick 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.330
 the very strong shot and I told you in 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.630
 the second penalty we're going to see the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.630
 later equal 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.330
 this goes towards the stick you can not see but the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.250
 ball goes well stretched hits intuits very 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.400
 well very well up another type of singing 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.120
 what we see a lot was winning in 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.550
 reality those 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.650
 of mourning whether they say it or not 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 had been created by the chances of goal 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.440
 that opened up to sing that was more 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.150
 that all the work he did very good 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.510
 very good match I would not like to see the 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.360
 press 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.790
 to walk so much gold 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.250
 télam 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.300
 take advantage of neutral there is no diffusion 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.300
 to give 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.940
 for merit because you have traveled 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.580
 enough has come very well maybe has 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.360
 lost speed but at a good pace 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.300
 aydin down the strong tomato will take 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.250
 if it is stick but difficult is very 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.240
 difficult no matter how much I want to live very 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.800
 difficult to achieve what matches 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.470
 do not end until you touch the sil goes to 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.630
 stop that and honestly when it's 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.240
 playing a game is behind Phoenician 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.820
 you can not doubt nor can you trust 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.820
 that ball has to come well 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.730
 bernardo costs breaking the line but 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.220
 have the band save you have to 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.770
 bust the note any room the 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.610
 second one exact the stadium the forgiveness 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.100
 of course and crouching still has 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.440
 a player our meter 90 and he has left 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.700
 fair 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.700
 to look
