Assassin's<00:00:00.570> Creed<00:00:00.750> has<00:00:00.780> been<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.199> env3<00:00:02.100> since

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.249 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since
the<00:00:02.669> beginning<00:00:03.060> so<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.449> know<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> develop

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
the beginning so we know how to develop

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.410 
the beginning so we know how to develop
for<00:00:04.710> ps3<00:00:05.009> but<00:00:05.700> now<00:00:05.850> we're<00:00:06.029> really<00:00:06.180> enjoying

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.570 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying
developing<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.200> ps4<00:00:07.710> first<00:00:08.130> thing<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.519> is

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
developing for ps4 first thing that is

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.890 
developing for ps4 first thing that is
going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.760> change<00:00:08.940> drastically<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
going to change drastically as the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.110 
going to change drastically as the
graphics<00:00:10.349> because<00:00:10.920> we<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.519> visually

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
graphics because we think that visually

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.780 
graphics because we think that visually
with<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> stronger<00:00:13.110> GPU<00:00:13.530> stronger<00:00:13.920> CPU<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> lot

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
with the stronger GPU stronger CPU a lot

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.760 
with the stronger GPU stronger CPU a lot
of<00:00:14.910> RAM<00:00:15.150> we're<00:00:15.480> gonna<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:15.809> able<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.139> exploit<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
of RAM we're gonna be able to exploit a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.740 
of RAM we're gonna be able to exploit a
lot<00:00:17.039> discounsel<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.820> push<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> bar<00:00:18.359> visual

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
lot discounsel and push the bar visual

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.870 
lot discounsel and push the bar visual
it's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.199> lot<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:19.560> intuitive<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.400> engineers

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
it's a lot more intuitive for engineers

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's a lot more intuitive for engineers
it's<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> lot<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.869> compute<00:00:22.500> shaders

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it's a lot more like compute shaders

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.099 
it's a lot more like compute shaders
that<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.189> add<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.640> put<00:00:23.880> them<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.359> ps4<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that we add and put them on the ps4 and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.349 
that we add and put them on the ps4 and
all<00:00:25.980> these<00:00:26.220> new<00:00:26.580> texts<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.029> we're<00:00:27.119> pushing

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
all these new texts that we're pushing

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.339 
all these new texts that we're pushing
are<00:00:27.810> natively<00:00:28.680> fitting<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> ps4<00:00:30.349> all

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
are natively fitting in the ps4 all

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
are natively fitting in the ps4 all
little<00:00:31.920> details<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.969> cannot<00:00:33.300> right<00:00:33.630> now

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
little details that you cannot right now

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
little details that you cannot right now
put<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> current<00:00:35.010> generation<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
put on the current generation of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
put on the current generation of
consoles<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.750> council<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.200> being

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
consoles because the council is being

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
consoles because the council is being
fully<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.340> running<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.640> hundred

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
fully like it's running a hundred

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.299 
fully like it's running a hundred
percent<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:39.300> now<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.590> cannot<00:00:40.800> add<00:00:41.010> all

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
percent right now so you cannot add all

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
percent right now so you cannot add all
these<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.820> details<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
these little details that are going to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.299 
these little details that are going to
make<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> game<00:00:43.200> even<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.710> beautiful<00:00:43.860> more

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
make the game even more beautiful more

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.330 
make the game even more beautiful more
immersive<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.600> overall<00:00:46.140> ps4<00:00:46.860> experience

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
immersive the overall ps4 experience

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.979 
immersive the overall ps4 experience
that<00:00:47.550> make<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> game<00:00:48.149> look<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.750> better

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that make the game look so much better

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.709 
that make the game look so much better
on<00:00:49.289> ps4<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.760> definitely<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.480> share

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
on ps4 I think definitely the share

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
on ps4 I think definitely the share
button<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:52.980> cool

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
button is something really really cool

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.510 
button is something really really cool
because<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.649> love<00:00:55.649> us<00:00:55.800> keep<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
because now it will love us keep the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.099 
because now it will love us keep the
single-player<00:00:56.940> experience<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
single-player experience but make it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.560 
single-player experience but make it
connected<00:00:58.710> trying<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> blend<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.420> together

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
connected trying to blend more together

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.209 
connected trying to blend more together
like<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.170> friends<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.590> still<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.800> even

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
like your friends are still there even

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.709 
like your friends are still there even
if<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.609> playing<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.969> single-player<00:01:03.390> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
if you're playing in single-player you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.609 
if you're playing in single-player you
don't<00:01:03.899> necessarily<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> play

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
don't necessarily want to play

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
companion gaming so it's going to be a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.780 
companion gaming so it's going to be a
nice<00:01:12.630> evolution<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.500> terms<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> gaming

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
nice evolution in terms of the gaming

world the assassins creed 4 black flag
will<00:01:17.159> merge<00:01:17.610> ground<00:01:18.299> gameplay<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> naval

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
will merge ground gameplay and naval
