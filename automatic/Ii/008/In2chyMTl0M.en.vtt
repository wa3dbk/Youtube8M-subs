00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.190
 good greeting to all my friends from 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.189
 hd android in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.500
 teach how to root the galaxy is 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.759
 good in easy and simple process well 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.160
 like in the previous one that I have also 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.080
 of the rut and good here we see with this 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.150
 application that is what I named him in the 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.430
 past video of the rut in the checkbook rut 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.990
 it does not go verifi let's verify 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.860
 when the origin 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.020
 congratulations your device is 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.310
 accepted good has a root if you do not 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.280
 will appear in red 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.590
 then what we are going to do is copy 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.610
 to the root of the cd the file 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.050
 ginn jr a role that I have in the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.010
 description let's repeat the steps 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.060
 prior to the previous video we're going 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.310
 to enter into recovery mode 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.520
 I do not understand press the home button and the 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.520
 power 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.470
 let's go appear sants logo 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.809
 well the disadvantage that the root has is 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.949
 which for example loses the guarantee 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.320
 so here we can remove the root and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.400
 Take it to the guarantee if we want something 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.920
 we're going to apply equally and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.259
 for the item we apply the ginger root and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.540
 for this we will apply james and 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.700
 ginger a roth 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.509
 then we will give here leads 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.509
 resist av 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.720
 We will wait for it to start, we will check with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.720
 the root application 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.270
 let's hope it starts 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.010
 of this ute or not 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.159
 and I'm going to put the pin code 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.580
 and good here is what is already the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.580
 device on 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.220
 I hope that approach we will use the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.220
 application 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.130
 I do not know how to find it 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.099
 here ritcher 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.170
 here we understand now verify that that 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.170
 focus 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.459
 here you can see say lucas sets and sorry 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.560
 and does not have good neutral access that has 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.390
 been everything we can also check that 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 does not have the application 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.900
 and well this has been all for this video 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.900
 we see in a next video
