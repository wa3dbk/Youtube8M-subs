00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello and heartily women at high tide 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.350
 james tv today it's about that again 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.210
 theme breast training I often get 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.970
 asked mario what are you doing for yours 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 breast as you train you doing 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.480
 I want to give you an exercise today 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.230
 I really like that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.689
 It's the butterfly or flying on the cable 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.269
 I'll show you now that's one 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.279
 Do you breast for the inner area of ​​the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.890
 breast in front of what we have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.509
 a big sequence of movements and me 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 can explain you how the chest muscle 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.149
 works functionally 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.949
 It is this exercise as well as that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.620
 Muscles and down the works 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.640
 means he goes in front of those in the arm 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.410
 far back and leads the arm forward 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.679
 and if you're hooking yourself up expensive 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.739
 Breast fills a hand on the chest lays 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.790
 and take the poor from up here 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.899
 back to the front and 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.420
 relaxed automatically in the bus must 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.670
 will feel down to the smallest detail then 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.940
 here too in the inner area of ​​the breast 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.369
 the muscles are already controlled 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:16.420
 that's exactly what we do not do 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:20.159
 apart from top to bottom 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.050
 we do both have 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.510
 important in this world 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.940
 I show you now is the first 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.030
 I've been watching for myself in many 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.610
 gyms of often the disaster 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.980
 here we are here with both 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.560
 legs together with one leg 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.500
 earlier really far forward as 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.299
 that they stably stand the heels 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.520
 best approach 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.900
 so you guys 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.550
 janssen 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.550
 right city here 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.550
 Wegelin 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.220
 hermann angle 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.220
 this is virtually our starting point 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.539
 our starting position and then from here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.880
 Let's go with the arm bent 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.550
 almost stretched together far forward 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.600
 the elbow joint is moving in the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.760
 whole movement 1 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.439
 that means she is going forward again 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.910
 stretches slowly year by year 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.180
 forward 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.970
 slowly back again 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.390
 puts forward thinking of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.580
 we stick to one place and we 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.090
 you will stand against that 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.090
 dish 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.150
 when we look at each other from the side 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.400
 you see that you're behind it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.400
 and my people in a suit 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.620
 so I really do not put too few 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:12.409
 right on the move in and have my 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.920
 are in a line with the breast, so to speak 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.670
 here 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.629
 right here is my body center right in here 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.079
 I'm rehearsing a line not two 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.079
 Customer 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.880
 stays at chest height all the time 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.880
 my hands 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.970
 stretch my arms further forward 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.890
 every meaningful course of movement 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.890
 very special 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.829
 okay that's it 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.849
 It is important that we do not go too far 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.939
 goes down 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.469
 We want our breasts too 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.109
 We can isolate the movement 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:07.609
 do it on a bank and take us 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.609
 our drive the device 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.370
 and go to a bank then we can 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.319
 here on the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.790
 a part of the breast isolate what he does 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.480
 we just did it 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.110
 below that means we train the crazy 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.380
 lower part consciously inside lower 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.180
 share such an unworthy always second 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.920
 or third exercises on programs 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.070
 only as first exercises would always 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.400
 recommend makes reason and mass building in 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.370
 force the bank to press with long or 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.500
 banks with dumbbells because individual 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.830
 Remember when you build muscle 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.990
 wool construction works then that works 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.660
 only managed if you have enough power 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.840
 have and for the build up of strength 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.610
 one side around 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.139
 force here you can on the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.639
 other side again heavy and 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.389
 to train more intensively for muscles 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.720
 build 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.430
 the principle always suggests that 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.470
 power the function 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.889
 what i have just shown you i 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.360
 me a functional 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:13.800
 and to define the muscles 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.979
 in the sense of forming and shaping 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.420
 definition elaborate details the 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.250
 does not run over many anymore 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.690
 relaxation but runs only about what 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.690
 So you have it near you
