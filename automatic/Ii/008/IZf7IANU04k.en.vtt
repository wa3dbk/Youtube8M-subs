watermelon a watermelon this this drink
is<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.340> alkalinizing<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> body

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
is so alkalinizing for the body

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.630 
is so alkalinizing for the body
alkalinizing<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> acidity<00:00:44.520> level

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
alkalinizing so on the acidity level

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
alkalinizing so on the acidity level
it's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.450> low<00:00:45.690> acid<00:00:46.140> when<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.649> acid

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
it's a very low acid when we have acid

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.180 
it's a very low acid when we have acid
thrown<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:47.730> bodies<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.809> signals<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
thrown in our bodies it signals the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.279 
thrown in our bodies it signals the
bacteria<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.090> our<00:00:51.149> bodies<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.719> break<00:00:51.930> down<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
bacteria in our bodies to break down it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.170 
bacteria in our bodies to break down it
basically<00:00:52.559> says<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:52.980> dead<00:00:53.219> okay<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:53.940> we

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
basically says we're dead okay so we

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.080 
basically says we're dead okay so we
want<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> drink<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> eat<00:00:55.949> alkalinizing<00:00:56.730> food

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
want to drink and eat alkalinizing food

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.319 
want to drink and eat alkalinizing food
not<00:00:57.329> acid<00:00:57.840> precinct<00:00:58.320> foods<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> watermelon

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and that's it it digests so quickly that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
and that's it it digests so quickly that
if<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> eat<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:08.939> any<00:01:09.299> other<00:01:09.390> food<00:01:09.810> it
