00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello everyone today I bring you a brief 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.709
 analysis and reflection of the carcasses with 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.509
 mobile battery specifically I have 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.759
 the hand a case for iphone 6 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.400
 plus of 4000 milliamps of the brand 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.470
 one by one when picking it up we are not facing the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.570
 typical housing or cover to protect 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.550
 our mobile is an accessory that occupies 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.199
 a considerable volume and that is going to 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.810
 add the thickness and weight in exchange for 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.550
 gain autonomy basically what 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.910
 we have to do is connect the mobile to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.650
 the housing and place the frame the mobile 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.570
 has been connected to the battery of the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.489
 housing thanks to which we have plugged the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.469
 mobile phone connector inside the 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.629
 housing as you see having a mobile 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.579
 big by itself as is the iPhone 6 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.800
 Plus this type of case makes 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.140
 substantially increase the size 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.940
 also if it matches the connector 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.160
 the headphones is in the part 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
 lower we will need a cable to mode 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.570
 of extension to connect the helmets if 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.190
 we look at the back we have four 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.500
 LEDs that indicate the load if 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.059
 we press the button that we have if we 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.610
 they light everyone means we have 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.280
 between 75 and 100% battery 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.259
 available in the housing if we want it 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 our mobile is charged we must press 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.049
 the button three seconds 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.390
 will begin to spend the battery of the 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.460
 housing and start recharging the phone to 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 me what really disturbs me about this 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.600
 type of charges is the increase of 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.140
 size of the weight of the mobile housing 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.049
 weighs about 130 grams that is to say that together 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 to the mobile we go to almost 320 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.220
 grams I find a lot of weight to carry 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.200
 in the pocket 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.299
 alternative to this kind of carcasses with 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.009
 batteries are the power bands for example 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.799
 I have the one of xiaomi that is more than 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.899
 10,000 milliamps and weighs about 260 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.060
 grams can also prove a bit 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.159
 uncomfortable to carry in a pocket of a 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.470
 pants but there are more 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.810
 small in my opinion and for the use that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.549
 I give it to me with a power bank and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.860
 that I will not only be able to charge my mobile 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.539
 it also works for a tablet camera 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.420
 or any device that loads 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.720
 by usb for travel I really think 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.580
 useful notwithstanding this type of casings 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.440
 with batteries for mobile 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.690
 it seems to me that they increase the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.700
 thickness of the size of the mobile and for very 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.769
 I do not feel great, but if 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.810
 we have a 4-inch mobile we're going 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.640
 to be able to put a shell of this type and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 keep bringing in your pocket without 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.480
 weigh us almost 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.489
 so for specific moments and trips 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.170
 It may be useful but as I said 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.609
 If I had to buy a type of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.620
 External battery for mobile I 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.019
 would be with the power bands in front of 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.760
 housings with battery in case one has 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.319
 remained with doubts of what is coming 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.049
 with this case that I have shown you 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.299
 I mean it brings a usb cable a 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.790
 manual and the cable to extend the jack 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.459
 of the headphones its quality is decent 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.319
 and has good finishes and materials 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.269
 this particular case will allow us 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.760
 recharge the battery twice 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.650
 our iPhone 6 plus enough to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.989
 be a couple of days in a nearby outlet 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 If you want more information about her, 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.189
 I leave some links in the description this has 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.959
 been everything in case you liked the video 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.959
