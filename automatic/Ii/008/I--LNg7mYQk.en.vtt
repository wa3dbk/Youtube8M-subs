00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of you can tell the sound the style like

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.729 
of you can tell the sound the style like
changes<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.190> almost<00:00:50.610> each<00:00:50.879> song<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.739> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
changes with almost each song and the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.290 
changes with almost each song and the
ulm<00:00:52.890> itself<00:00:53.190> doesn't<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.550> flow<00:00:53.940> too<00:00:54.000> well

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ulm itself doesn't really flow too well

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
ulm itself doesn't really flow too well
is<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.600> three<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:54.870> four<00:00:54.960> songs<00:00:55.350> around<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is about three or four songs around I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.869 
is about three or four songs around I
think<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.469> New<00:00:58.469> World<00:00:58.710> Order<00:00:59.100> fast<00:00:59.520> lane

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
think it was New World Order fast lane

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
think it was New World Order fast lane
and<00:01:00.210> Black<00:01:00.539> Swan<00:01:00.899> knows<00:01:01.230> those<00:01:01.530> flow<00:01:01.739> pretty

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and Black Swan knows those flow pretty

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.910 
and Black Swan knows those flow pretty
well<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> rest<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
well but the rest of them it kind of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
well but the rest of them it kind of
jumps<00:01:05.250> around<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> album's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

it was a leftover song from around the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.260 
it was a leftover song from around the
cryptic<00:01:39.649> writings<00:01:39.860> time<00:01:40.310> because<00:01:41.240> it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
cryptic writings time because it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.279 
cryptic writings time because it
definitely<00:01:41.450> feels<00:01:41.720> like<00:01:41.840> came<00:01:42.140> off<00:01:42.259> that

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
definitely feels like came off that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.529 
definitely feels like came off that
album<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.850> song<00:01:44.030> itself<00:01:44.180> kind<00:01:44.509> of

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
album and the the song itself kind of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.800 
album and the the song itself kind of
slowly<00:01:44.930> changes<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.680> their<00:01:46.220> newer<00:01:46.490> stuff<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
slowly changes to their newer stuff the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.240 
slowly changes to their newer stuff the
riff<00:01:47.990> randomly<00:01:48.409> changes<00:01:48.740> towards<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.100> end

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
riff randomly changes towards the end

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.919 
riff randomly changes towards the end
and<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:50.030> feels<00:01:50.119> like<00:01:50.270> an<00:01:50.450> older<00:01:50.720> song

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929
