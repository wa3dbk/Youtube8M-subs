00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 while in the occupied Crimea continues 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.640
 food crisis 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.830
 self-proclaimed prime minister sergei 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.510
 Axenov instructs the Crimean manufacturer

 provide products not only 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 Peninsula but the whole of Russia is 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 the assignment he made at the meeting with 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 representatives of the trade networks of Crimea 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 According to Aksyonov, the rise in prices of products 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.010
 nutrition is the main theme of the appeal 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.900
 to him the Crimean us today is not a crisis 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.400
 zero reality in which we live and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.930
 drowned reality will come next 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 develop our task is to get out 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 provisions to precisely hold prices on 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.160
 food drugs 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.630
 at an acceptable level which 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 corresponds to ours today 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 colleagues and would like to appeal 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 to you understanding what to throw out today 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.480
 or business with a view 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.520
 that we all understand that we are 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 we are boats today and of course we want 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.100
 there was no speculation different exactly 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.270
 based on the current situation statement 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.219
 Aksenova about the fact that the Crimean 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.010
 manufacturers must provide 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.550
 products including Russia 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.870
 common press service 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.199
 occupying government 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.159
 raises questions just a month ago 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.299
 self-proclaimed prime minister announced 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.040
 negotiations with Turkish 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 entrepreneurs about the possibility 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 feed the Turkish peninsula 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 large entrepreneurs interested in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.390
 supplies and batteries skit Kirshin skie 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 ports directly food 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 really at prices which 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.729
 today will not exceed 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.920
 our large retail chains on 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259
 the peninsula today have difficulties 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
 with the presence of different product groups due 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.850
 problems with their supplies from mainland 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 parts of Ukraine and prices in the Crimea under the hour 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 higher than Moscow and St. Petersburg 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.640
 oksana confidence in that peninsula 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.159
 can feed himself too 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 it is doubtful whether it will become the Russians 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.510
 buy products at Crimean prices 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.280
 I think no on stage is overpriced 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.250
 I have people familiar in 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.780
 St. Petersburg they have bananas worth 40 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 rubles we have bananas worth 100 rubles 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.190
 altogether 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 because let 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.250
 the night was not superfluous of all if only 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.560
 money wrestler and prices as the price 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.820
 of course bites 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 according to the Crimean branch 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.840
 Federal Statistical Service for 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.700
 last year consumer prices in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.710
 Crimea grew by an average of 50 percent 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.140
 while some groups are real 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.150
 goods have risen in price several times 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.640
 one rapid price jump occurred 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.070
 in January, however, official data about him 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.070
 occupation authorities have not yet submitted
