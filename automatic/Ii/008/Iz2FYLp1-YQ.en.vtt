00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
flowers and it's easiest to take flowers

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.970 
flowers and it's easiest to take flowers
that<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.489> flat<00:00:38.930> already<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.410> right<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.949> i

that are flat already like right here i
have<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> periwinkle<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:42.720> some<00:00:42.989> others<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.379> i

have a periwinkle or some others that i
don't<00:00:43.890> recommend<00:00:44.250> drawing<00:00:44.790> flat<00:00:45.150> at<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.480> such

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
don't recommend drawing flat at all such

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.399 
don't recommend drawing flat at all such
as<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.769> daisy<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.540> black-eyed<00:00:48.960> susan

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
as a daisy or like a black-eyed susan

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.710 
as a daisy or like a black-eyed susan
that<00:00:49.589> have<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.909> big<00:00:51.180> thing<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
that have with the big thing in the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.920 
that have with the big thing in the
middle<00:00:51.839> aisle<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.860> turn<00:00:53.040> picture

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.430 

so<00:01:00.860> those<00:01:01.130> are<00:01:01.160> never<00:01:01.910> going<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.240> dry<00:01:02.480> flat<00:01:02.750> you

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
so those are never going to dry flat you

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.010 
so those are never going to dry flat you
might<00:01:03.650> individually<00:01:04.489> dry<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.760> petals<00:01:05.269> but

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
might individually dry the petals but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.280 
might individually dry the petals but
you<00:01:06.140> can't<00:01:06.380> dry<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:06.680> whole<00:01:07.010> flower

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.970 

this<00:01:13.040> is<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.460> bit<00:01:13.910> of<00:01:14.120> an<00:01:14.270> azalea<00:01:14.660> it<00:01:15.350> has<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
this is a bit of an azalea it has the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.000 
this is a bit of an azalea it has the
all<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.340> sex<00:01:19.670> organs<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.450> middle<00:01:20.890> now<00:01:21.890> you

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
all the sex organs in the middle now you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.820 
all the sex organs in the middle now you
want<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.220> take<00:01:22.340> all<00:01:22.550> those<00:01:22.820> out<00:01:23.120> and<00:01:23.530> then<00:01:24.530> just

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
want to take all those out and then just

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.510 
want to take all those out and then just
find<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.460> notch<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.860> should<00:01:28.010> be<00:01:28.130> really

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
find a notch and it should be really

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.590 
find a notch and it should be really
easy<00:01:28.550> to<00:01:28.970> split<00:01:29.210> down<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.390> middle<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:31.600> then

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
easy to split down the middle and then

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.250 
easy to split down the middle and then
flatten<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.290> up<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.690> don't<00:01:35.690> worry<00:01:35.900> if<00:01:35.990> you

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260

flatten it up and don't worry if you
make<00:01:37.190> little<00:01:37.640> tears<00:01:39.250> but<00:01:40.250> you're<00:01:40.400> going<00:01:40.550> to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610

look<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.930> they've<00:03:00.140> dried<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.500> little<00:03:00.620> bit

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
look like so they've dried a little bit

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.120 
look like so they've dried a little bit
but<00:03:02.240> now<00:03:02.420> I'm<00:03:02.510> going<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.720> flip<00:03:02.930> them<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.620> dry

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
but now I'm going to flip them and dry

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.760 
but now I'm going to flip them and dry
them<00:03:04.160> for<00:03:04.490> 30<00:03:04.670> more<00:03:04.880> seconds<00:03:09.970> dry<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.030> still

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
them for 30 more seconds dry is still

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.309 
them for 30 more seconds dry is still
okay<00:03:12.770> so<00:03:12.830> make<00:03:13.130> sure<00:03:13.160> they're<00:03:13.430> all<00:03:13.459> separated

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
okay so make sure they're all separated

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.710 
okay so make sure they're all separated
and<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.470> still<00:03:15.739> seems<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.610> being<00:03:16.910> kind<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.450> damp

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
and it still seems to being kind of damp

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.680 
and it still seems to being kind of damp
you<00:03:17.959> can<00:03:18.140> do<00:03:18.319> another<00:03:18.770> 30<00:03:19.160> seconds<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.540> you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
you can do another 30 seconds but you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.530 
you can do another 30 seconds but you
don't<00:03:20.930> want<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.200> do<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.550> any<00:03:22.550> longer<00:03:23.000> than<00:03:23.360> 30

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
don't want to do it any longer than 30

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.840 
don't want to do it any longer than 30
seconds<00:03:24.020> increments<00:03:24.709> because<00:03:25.100> because<00:03:25.670> it's

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
seconds increments because because it's

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.630 
seconds increments because because it's
such<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> small<00:03:26.390> amount<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.489> material<00:03:28.489> you're

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
such a small amount of material you're

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.100 
such a small amount of material you're
putting<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.120> microwave<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.600> don't<00:03:29.930> want

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
putting in the microwave you don't want

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.830 
putting in the microwave you don't want
anything<00:03:30.410> bad<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.800> happen<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.550> 30<00:03:32.150> seconds<00:03:32.720> at

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
anything bad to happen so 30 seconds at

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.040 
anything bad to happen so 30 seconds at
the<00:03:32.870> most

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.330 

you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.100 

okay<00:03:48.340> now<00:03:48.580> there's<00:03:48.940> just<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.450> little<00:03:49.780> bit<00:03:49.960> of

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
okay now there's just a little bit of

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.460 
okay now there's just a little bit of
moisture<00:03:50.730> left<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.690> want<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.050> have<00:03:53.230> that

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
moisture left and you want to have that

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.410 
moisture left and you want to have that
little<00:03:53.680> bit<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:53.950> moisture<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.760> has<00:03:55.620> some

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
little bit of moisture so it has some

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.380 
little bit of moisture so it has some
pliability<00:03:58.420> when<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.760> when<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.790> set<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.240> to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
pliability when you when you set it to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.970 
pliability when you when you set it to
dry<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:01.990> next<00:04:02.440> step<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:05.350> now<00:04:05.530> just<00:04:05.890> the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
dry it in the next step so now just the

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.370 
dry it in the next step so now just the
edges<00:04:06.460> i<00:04:06.580> started<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.120> be<00:04:07.300> starting<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.260> be

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
edges i started to be starting to be

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.860 
edges i started to be starting to be
really<00:04:08.680> dry<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:10.120> middle<00:04:10.390> part<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.750> still

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.260 
really dry and the middle part is still
kind<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.320> what<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.800> that's<00:04:12.460> perfect<00:04:13.180> that's

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270

the reason to do all this instead of

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.270 
the reason to do all this instead of
just<00:06:00.780> putting<00:06:01.080> them<00:06:01.380> into<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.770> book<00:06:02.010> and

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
just putting them into a book and

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.190 
just putting them into a book and
letting<00:06:03.090> them<00:06:03.210> dry<00:06:03.510> for<00:06:03.930> a<00:06:04.230> long<00:06:04.440> time<00:06:04.740> is<00:06:06.200> that

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
letting them dry for a long time is that

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.740 
letting them dry for a long time is that
if<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.620> drive<00:06:07.980> them<00:06:08.220> faster<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.150> take<00:06:09.390> out<00:06:09.570> as

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
if you drive them faster and take out as

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.970 
if you drive them faster and take out as
much<00:06:09.930> water<00:06:10.110> as<00:06:10.260> possible<00:06:10.820> faster<00:06:11.820> than

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
much water as possible faster than

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.410 
much water as possible faster than
you're<00:06:13.980> not<00:06:14.250> going<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.490> lose<00:06:14.670> any<00:06:14.730> of<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.240> good

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
you're not going to lose any of the good

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.420 
you're not going to lose any of the good
colors<00:06:15.870> this<00:06:16.200> is<00:06:16.350> especially<00:06:16.590> important<00:06:17.310> if

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
colors this is especially important if

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.390 
colors this is especially important if
you're<00:06:17.550> drying<00:06:17.820> leaves<00:06:18.120> because<00:06:18.720> leaves<00:06:19.650> have

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
you're drying leaves because leaves have

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.190 
you're drying leaves because leaves have
the<00:06:20.940> most<00:06:21.120> water<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.660> they<00:06:21.750> have<00:06:21.900> a<00:06:21.930> lot<00:06:22.170> of

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
the most water and they have a lot of

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.830 
the most water and they have a lot of
vasculature<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:24.000> make<00:06:24.120> sure<00:06:24.360> you<00:06:24.510> know<00:06:24.660> it's

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
vasculature to make sure you know it's

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:33.500 
vasculature to make sure you know it's
okay<00:06:25.200> to<00:06:25.260> take<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.620> flowers

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.640 

you

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.460 

and<00:06:36.190> just<00:06:36.400> remember<00:06:36.520> that<00:06:36.970> flowers<00:06:37.360> do<00:06:37.630> die<00:06:37.900> so

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
and just remember that flowers do die so

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.780 
and just remember that flowers do die so
what<00:06:39.430> a<00:06:39.460> great<00:06:39.790> way<00:06:39.970> to<00:06:40.030> preserve<00:06:40.360> them

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.180 

I<00:06:44.930> hope<00:06:45.930> this<00:06:46.080> is<00:06:46.260> helpful<00:06:46.530> it<00:06:46.740> was<00:06:46.860> hard<00:06:47.130> for

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
I hope this is helpful it was hard for

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.040 
I hope this is helpful it was hard for
me<00:06:47.340> to<00:06:47.520> show<00:06:47.700> it<00:06:47.730> but<00:06:48.090> i'll<00:06:48.240> try<00:06:48.420> to<00:06:48.540> show<00:06:48.660> it

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
me to show it but i'll try to show it

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.410 
me to show it but i'll try to show it
again<00:06:49.170> I'll<00:06:49.560> maybe<00:06:50.010> when<00:06:50.340> other<00:06:50.670> flowers<00:06:51.180> come

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
again I'll maybe when other flowers come

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.880 
again I'll maybe when other flowers come
up<00:06:51.540> I'll<00:06:51.720> show<00:06:51.750> different<00:06:52.320> techniques<00:06:52.710> on

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
up I'll show different techniques on

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.710 
up I'll show different techniques on
getting<00:06:53.250> them<00:06:53.400> flat<00:06:53.670> in<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:53.940> first<00:06:54.210> place<00:06:54.360> and

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
getting them flat in the first place and

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.900 
getting them flat in the first place and
so<00:06:55.380> you'll<00:06:55.560> be<00:06:55.740> able<00:06:55.770> to<00:06:56.010> use<00:06:56.100> more<00:06:56.520> and<00:06:56.730> more
