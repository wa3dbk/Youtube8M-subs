00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.469 
form I thought they wanted with
temperament<00:04:17.159> and<00:04:17.310> they<00:04:17.729> wanted<00:04:18.060> on<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.209> set

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
temperament and they wanted on a set

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.949 
temperament and they wanted on a set

the park

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.560 
the park
into<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> back<00:04:28.170> of<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.410> net<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:29.420> think<00:04:30.420> they

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.360 
into the back of the net I think they
showed<00:04:30.810> more<00:04:31.080> discipline<00:04:31.680> than<00:04:31.710> than<00:04:32.250> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.570 
thought in many ways it was disgraceful
much<00:04:39.470> for<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> amount<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.890> fouls<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.400> went

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
much for the amount of fouls that went

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.850

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
the first half there was just as many in

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.330 
the first half there was just as many in
the<00:04:45.810> second<00:04:46.170> half<00:04:46.350> as<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:46.980> said<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.310> the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340
