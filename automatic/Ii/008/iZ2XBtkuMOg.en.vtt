this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.510> benchmark<00:00:18.810> speed<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:20.480> my

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
this is the benchmark speed for my

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.259 
this is the benchmark speed for my
device<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:22.830> right<00:00:23.070> below<00:00:23.279> HTC<00:00:24.180> One<00:00:24.390> X<00:00:24.680> so

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
device it was right below HTC One X so

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.929 
device it was right below HTC One X so
you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.689> how<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> device<00:00:28.710> performs<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you can see how the device performs and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.990 
you can see how the device performs and
it's<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.570> slow<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.080> all<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.640> really

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's not slow at all so I was really

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.530 
it's not slow at all so I was really
impressed<00:00:33.239> about<00:00:33.719> how<00:00:33.930> smooth<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.460> f3<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
impressed about how smooth the f3 is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.860 
impressed about how smooth the f3 is
compared<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> Galaxy<00:00:38.340> Nexus<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
compared to Galaxy Nexus at first I

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.380 
compared to Galaxy Nexus at first I
didn't<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.410> expect<00:00:40.739> much<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.610> Galaxy

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
didn't really expect much because Galaxy

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
didn't really expect much because Galaxy
Nexus<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.780> also<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> dual-core<00:00:44.040> processor<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
Nexus is also a dual-core processor is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
Nexus is also a dual-core processor is
now<00:00:44.969> slow<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.570> mine<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.980> overclocked<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
now slow and mine was overclocked so it

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
now slow and mine was overclocked so it
was<00:00:49.050> supposed<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> running<00:00:49.710> faster<00:00:50.430> than

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
was supposed to be running faster than

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.020 
was supposed to be running faster than
the<00:00:51.000> original<00:00:52.399> usual<00:00:53.399> Galaxy<00:00:53.879> Nexus<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
the original usual Galaxy Nexus but I

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
the original usual Galaxy Nexus but I
noticed<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.090> lg<00:00:57.809> optimus<00:00:58.050> f3<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:59.550> acting

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
noticed that lg optimus f3 was acting

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.429 
noticed that lg optimus f3 was acting
more<00:01:00.629> smooth<00:01:01.410> even<00:01:02.399> though<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.359> got<00:01:03.750> lot

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
more smooth even though it's got lot

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100 
more smooth even though it's got lot
where's<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.949> Metro<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.659> got<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
touch waves on top of the Android so

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.230 
touch waves on top of the Android so

at first

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.749 
at first
I<00:01:31.920> bought<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.180> portable<00:01:34.140> charger<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
I bought the portable charger for the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.380 
I bought the portable charger for the
battery<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.900> didn't<00:01:37.799> work<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.579> didn't<00:01:39.270> have

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
battery and didn't work I didn't have

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
battery and didn't work I didn't have
extra<00:01:39.570> room<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.290> pocket<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:40.860> any<00:01:41.159> every

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
extra room in my pocket at any every

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
extra room in my pocket at any every
time<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.350> good

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
time so it was not good

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.840 
time so it was not good
later<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> decided<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.869> buy<00:01:46.250> extra<00:01:47.250> battery

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
later I decided to buy extra battery

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
later I decided to buy extra battery
even<00:01:48.840> though<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.439> extended<00:01:50.040> battery<00:01:50.310> from

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
even though I have extended battery from

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.330 
even though I have extended battery from
Verizon<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.930> needed<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.619> batteries<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
Verizon I still needed more batteries so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.840 
Verizon I still needed more batteries so
I<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:54.149> one<00:01:54.450> battery<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:56.280> charger

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
I got one battery and one charger

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.420 
I got one battery and one charger
that<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.930> charge<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.710> other<00:01:58.799> battery<00:01:59.250> when

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that I can charge the other battery when

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.530 
that I can charge the other battery when
one<00:02:00.060> battery<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:02.540> well

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
one battery is actually in use well

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.899 
one battery is actually in use well
there<00:02:04.409> worked<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.770> pretty<00:02:04.979> good<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.579> it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
there worked out pretty good but it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.600 
there worked out pretty good but it
didn't<00:02:06.390> still<00:02:07.170> last<00:02:07.590> full<00:02:07.979> day<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
didn't still last full day so

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.690 
didn't still last full day so
I<00:02:09.640> ended<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.450> buying<00:02:10.780> another<00:02:11.200> battery<00:02:12.010> which

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
I ended up buying another battery which

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.990 
I ended up buying another battery which
came<00:02:13.270> in<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.260> package<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.890> two<00:02:14.920> because<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.850> was

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
came in a package of two because it was

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.710 
came in a package of two because it was
it<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.200> little<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.590> money<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.130> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
it was just a little more money and I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.570 
it was just a little more money and I
thought<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.780> might<00:02:19.930> need<00:02:20.380> two<00:02:21.040> more<00:02:21.160> batteries

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
thought I might need two more batteries

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.860 
thought I might need two more batteries
so<00:02:22.140> total<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.350> had<00:02:23.530> four<00:02:23.950> batteries<00:02:24.480> two<00:02:25.480> top

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
so total I had four batteries two top

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.610 
so total I had four batteries two top
charger<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.940> would<00:02:28.180> last<00:02:28.570> me<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:29.350> one

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
charger and that would last me for one

so<00:03:02.340> lg<00:03:03.340> optimus<00:03:03.510> after<00:03:04.510> II<00:03:04.540> however<00:03:05.040> I'm

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
so lg optimus after II however I'm

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.699 
so lg optimus after II however I'm
guessing<00:03:06.580> it's<00:03:06.840> one<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.050> reason<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.440> last

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
guessing it's one of the reason it last

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.270 
guessing it's one of the reason it last
is<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.510> new<00:03:10.690> one<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.170> at<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.980> end<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
is it's a new one but at the end of the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.220 
is it's a new one but at the end of the
end<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.820> day<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.000> had<00:03:14.459> more<00:03:15.459> than<00:03:15.730> 40%

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
end of the day I had more than 40%

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.990 
end of the day I had more than 40%
battery<00:03:19.019> if<00:03:20.019> even<00:03:20.709> though<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:20.890> was<00:03:21.250> using<00:03:21.700> it

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
battery if even though I was using it

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000 
battery if even though I was using it
constantly<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.230> was<00:03:23.350> sinking<00:03:23.860> through

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
constantly and it was sinking through

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.810 
constantly and it was sinking through
the<00:03:24.190> Google<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.530> everything<00:03:26.530> was<00:03:27.160> set<00:03:27.489> up<00:03:27.519> as

of good things about this phone but one
other<00:03:46.450> thing<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.959> never<00:03:47.230> worked<00:03:47.590> for<00:03:47.830> me<00:03:47.890> was

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.500 
that the smart screen it keep screen on
while<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.100> device<00:03:51.400> detects<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.239> your<00:03:52.480> eye

while the device detects that your eye
and<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.920> will<00:03:54.010> see<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.310> eye<00:03:54.340> icon<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.269> top

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
and you will see the eye icon on the top

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.460 
and you will see the eye icon on the top
left<00:03:55.510> corner<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:57.330> it's<00:03:58.330> supposed<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.900> stay<00:03:59.140> on

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
left corner and it's supposed to stay on

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.360 
left corner and it's supposed to stay on
if<00:03:59.709> I'm<00:03:59.860> looking<00:04:00.040> at<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.340> but<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.989> doesn't<00:04:02.380> it

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
if I'm looking at it but it doesn't it

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.690 
if I'm looking at it but it doesn't it
never<00:04:03.730> worked<00:04:04.150> for<00:04:04.450> me<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.170> that's<00:04:05.920> one<00:04:06.370> thing

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
never worked for me so that's one thing

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.000 
never worked for me so that's one thing
that<00:04:08.850> LG<00:04:09.850> kind<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.870> did<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> same<00:04:11.620> thing<00:04:11.890> as

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
that LG kind of did the same thing as

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.960 
that LG kind of did the same thing as
the<00:04:12.130> Samsung<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:13.239> it's<00:04:14.230> not<00:04:14.860> working<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.459> think

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
the Samsung but it's not working I think

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.650 
the Samsung but it's not working I think
it<00:04:16.150> should<00:04:16.510> be<00:04:17.280> related<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.760> camera<00:04:19.239> at

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
it should be related to the camera at

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.840 
it should be related to the camera at
the<00:04:19.720> camera<00:04:20.289> front-facing<00:04:20.859> camera<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.609> this

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the camera front-facing camera on this

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.820 
the camera front-facing camera on this
device<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.390> not<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.810> great<00:04:24.960> very<00:04:25.960> low

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
device is not that great very low

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.920 
device is not that great very low
quality<00:04:28.169> camera<00:04:29.169> on<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.620> front<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.930> may

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
quality camera on the front so that may

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.180 
quality camera on the front so that may
that<00:04:32.110> may<00:04:32.169> be<00:04:32.530> why<00:04:33.240> it's<00:04:34.240> not<00:04:34.830> detecting<00:04:35.830> my

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
that may be why it's not detecting my

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.690 
that may be why it's not detecting my
eyes<00:04:36.460> when<00:04:37.180> I'm<00:04:37.300> looking<00:04:37.450> at<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.550> want

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
eyes when I'm looking at it and I want

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.520 
eyes when I'm looking at it and I want
to<00:04:39.849> briefly<00:04:40.150> mention<00:04:40.270> about<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.930> speed<00:04:41.229> test

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
to briefly mention about the speed test

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.740 
to briefly mention about the speed test
results<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:43.210> there's<00:04:43.630> 15<00:04:44.110> tests<00:04:44.590> done<00:04:44.800> and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
results so there's 15 tests done and

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.940 
results so there's 15 tests done and
most<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:46.990> time<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.590> got<00:04:48.520> fairly<00:04:48.910> good<00:04:49.270> speed

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
most of the time I got fairly good speed

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.920 
most of the time I got fairly good speed
sometimes<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:51.099> get<00:04:51.340> eight<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.210> sometimes<00:04:52.750> I

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
sometimes I get eight and sometimes I

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.920 
sometimes I get eight and sometimes I
get<00:04:53.140> 40<00:04:53.560> 2.74<00:04:56.580> with<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.729> Verizon's<00:04:58.210> Network<00:04:58.660> I

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
get 40 2.74 with the Verizon's Network I

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.150 
get 40 2.74 with the Verizon's Network I
