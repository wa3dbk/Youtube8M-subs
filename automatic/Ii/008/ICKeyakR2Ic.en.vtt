 the mold of two types of hearts one 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.399
 bigger because the other one does not 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.810
 you do not feel like doing 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.509

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 true hearts are super hearts 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.380
 easy that the truth as they are up to 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.750
 bad facts good but then here they look 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.869
 very pretty so good you what 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.610
 they can do or they print these 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.710
 molds that are going to find a page in 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.020
 facebook and good 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.090
 after we have printed it we will have 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 other basic things that were good 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.830
 let's avoid going to be the black down 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.530
 and I'm taking a gel pen 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.320
 white if they do not have white color 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.710
 can also occupy the corrector that 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.420
 that comes in pen also a pair of scissors 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.500
 and glue any glue that 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.680
 you have and a mobile eye 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.310
 just an ojito and well then that's 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.750
 all 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.690
 as I told you they are going to print their 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.660
 hearts are going to need two of a 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.700
 same size and the one that is going to be the base 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.790
 that is going to open and I explained how 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.040
 is that we do this so that it opens up in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.720
 the first video taught him to be the puppy 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.690
 there he taught them how to do this super 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 easy and good then let's start let's go 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 to put our heart in this way 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.250
 well, we're going to start with 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.330
 put the head the head we're going to 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.010
 put like this 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.319
 Nikkei 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.569
 and so while we will put also 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.060
 the little tail I call to the tail 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.569
 how is it called the fins not how 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.760
 is that they call him I put him in the mold 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:02.390
 the tail ay ay ay how come here I put him 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.579
 head and tail and today there is someone who 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.350
 explain how it's called good I here you 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.110
 I put my tail 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.900
 and let's see so we like how 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.830
 is going to be our little fish after 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.300
 that it does that we have seen calculated 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.650
 that we will like there, well, there 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.079
 we leave it 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.720
 and we're going to start putting glue on 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.760
 in this case I am using in bar 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.860
 only 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.970
 so be a part of the heart to the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.450
 I'm going to put half of my heart 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.409
 glue in bar bastantito so that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.409
 do not take off 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.120
 yes and now we are going to start 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.120
 hit him 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.440
 yes 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.560
 I believe that there is 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.770
 A) Yes 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.290
 this is how we will stay now 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.900
 here so that it really looks like a 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.910
 little mouth of fish what I do that 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.690
 I do here the little tips I make you as well as 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.690
 a wave 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.430
 yes 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.020
 and here it stays and the beak of 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.260
 a good little fish now we are going to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.660
 keep putting the other part of the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.060
 tail that I call or fins do not 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.840
 I know how they call themselves equally 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.600
 Lets put 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.660
 what you can do here you are going to 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.919
 see how far they want the fins in the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.250
 colita as you see there so I think there's me 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.470
 like or we get it like that more like that and where 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.239
 you like how they stay there can 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.600
 make a mark with pencil 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:05.689
 they just slowly make marquez 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.009
 as you see here it does not look good 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:12.409
 We go there is the brand with the stylus to 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.349
 guide me and I can put there the 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.709
 glue know exactly where it puts the 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.709
 glue 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.059
 there 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.059
 Now let's stick it back 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.800
 5 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.009
 the cousins ​​well for them to stick 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.089
 with our gel pen 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:49.300
 we make here a hairline as well as if 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:51.819
 was cooked to highlight the 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.029
 heart this look more beautiful our 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.599
 fish as you see here equally here you 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.599
 I make one 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.219
 so that simply so that it 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.219

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.390

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.390
 I dont know 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.720
 Now let's make our mouth the 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.840
 mouth so we are going to do as a 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.840
