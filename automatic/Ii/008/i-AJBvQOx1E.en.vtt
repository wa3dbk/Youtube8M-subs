00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:10.670
 [Music] 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.880
 I come in this minute the second and 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.490
 as you can see from the video right now 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.470
 this moment and for the title I have them 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.169
 the review in a way that in English it 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.050
 called smart moving but I wanted it 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:27.140
 translate as best movements of 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.449
 crouch scale jump nothing the truth 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.489
 because this mode is infinity of things 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.170
 for making an apology first of all 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.960
 because today I'm going to use this kind of 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.460
 view and never use it I've never 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.870
 used so they are going to enjoy a 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.070
 little things in case they do not have 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.989
 pictures because if I want to paste it 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.890
 Squared hit him that factor do not come out 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.079
 good things 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.070
 well this mod uses more than anything the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.070
 control key is its greatest use in the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.949
 control letter but to say we have 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.960
 this line of pictures a picture a 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.809
 picture a picture instead of skipping the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.809
 a typical and boring way because I do not 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.630
 we see as an action movie 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.150
 climbing the boxes and leaving you 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.670
 flattened to control as you flip them 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.340
 but supporting you a little more realistic than 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.430
 just jump a meter in the sky or 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.500
 it gives you a little more realism 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.020
 jumping 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.630
 climbing rather well also what you 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.090
 adds is this kind of movements by 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.689
 decide look 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.520
 you are here and you give double the right da 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.929
 a jump to the right if the two of the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.299
 left also with the left and it 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.250
 makes one back was a little 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.240
 harder to do it or sorry for 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.759
 that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.530
 good to a jump back but this is 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.630
 it's making it difficult for me to do that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.490
 can you serve us by saying you're 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.720
 activating a monster we are going to lower a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:54.430
 little bit the sound is a monster or not we 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.229
 and elusive and elusive hiding for this 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.500
 sight and dodge or be loved the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.610
 I jump and there we are going to remove the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 peaceful so that they are not doing 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.060
 noise 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.640
 to see if they had it done 22 for a 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.950
 good side what we saw of stooping 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.250
 it breaks you 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.260
 they have to leave a flattened file and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 later to the control and already they are going away to be able 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.640
 put in what are pictures of one by 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.640
 one as if they were dragging 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.720
 in that position 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.150
 another thing what the mode adds is that 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.910
 now we can make three jumps like 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.300
 a little more realistic parkour type 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.060
 we jump and we grab and we give 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.980
 up 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.920
 now let's see it again because this 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.220
 view does not help me at all 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.280
 another ready let's do it again 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.740
 and ready for those difficult jumps this 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.500
 it's going to be much more than perfect because 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.090
 can jump 33 frames up and 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.090
 they can be grabbed because if they fall 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.230
 let's try it if it is falling today 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.150
 you grab the club and you also grab 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.030
 what adds them are animations I do not 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.280
 I want to fall as you want, nothing happens 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.170
 they are fall animations by saying 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.940
 now they will be able to see what it looks like 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.610
 as if a normal person and 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.650
 they will also give as one more person 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.780
 normal you want more realism until the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 fall animation as you can see now 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.370
 the animation of swimming 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.900
 there is the swim the toad the swim of the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.860
 mermaid we are now swimming from 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.060
 frijolito and now of pancake because 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.980
 as you are sticking the need to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.650
 I just said if we go up a bit more to 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.120
 the surface we will be able to swim as 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.760
 if we were already out of the water already 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.280
 can see how the Olympics from 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.350
 down it looks like this because we're swimming 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.020
 fast and then from above and we're 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.170
 swimming like toad again again 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.520
 and if we stay like that, we just float 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.460
 perform the rhythm of the water 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.160
 the other animation is to fly and we 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.840
 Superman will be able to fly but if 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.940
 they stop flattening to fall and they continue 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.400
 only to fly will only fall 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.630
 super am i 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.820
 these good but not 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.190
 but if you give the animation it's like 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.810
 out to superman or anything not 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.540
 going to say stop running in the air 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.459
 as we normally see it or be the same 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.830
 well walking but we will not see in 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.300
 the air and then this link 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.790
 elling misfortune we are going to be there 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.530
 is going to be a link to minecraft eo there 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.000
 gives everything you need for 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.610
 to be able to install this link until the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.820
 instructions the link the mod and they will 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.710
 have everything and I hope you like it and then 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.150
 do not forget to like it and and here we are 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.610
 pleasing because they had wanted more 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.080
 motorcycles here have more mod and therefore 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.740
 dismiss and corner and see you until 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.740
 the next
