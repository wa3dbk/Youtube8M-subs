00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello and welcome youtube to your cuban warrior and that is 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.430
 my first part of the ten thousand subscribers special confess Warburger 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.599
 mimic on the map on 9 and I packed my suitcase the 1 Emma 1 so 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.519
 the leak on my ass 1 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.359
 and everything worked out 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.570
 as a lack of space balance roughly 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.230
 so I totally 7 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.669
 to Walldorf 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.309
 because I do not need a psychological advantage and need the essays 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.010
 Tactical more than safe shit on but taken care of with this time 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.270
 To the opponents just just scared of me and race way 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.070
 like this wrong 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.840
 so the problem is 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.900
 The animal does not completely focus on the opponents to focus on new ones 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.440
 Kammer dismissed how title stumbles that makes deficit easy 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.070
 the air 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 and the Kogel are caught that way 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840
 that does not meet 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
 the spot it is unfortunately taking and I must honestly say Ferreira 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.470
 Martin Hohmann says Friedersdorff on state television 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.260
 I'm so neat with this Commander Kriegers board Lameck time a ninth 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.700
 Despite brought so that I can no longer apply this cadre Friedersdorf 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.960
 because otherwise weather conditions boring 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.130
 a and i would just july confused 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.640
 that is just the most important point I must say that I am in this 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.540
 during the entire market games 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.590
 I took off all my clothes before we started 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.710
 is dissected splinter naked why just around me 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.900
 Feel at ease and positions 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 to focus on this game 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850
 and that's actually the most important condition you can pass through 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.840
 The game is way too easy for the IKA to do it right here with one 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 Mug from ORF tried to kill the opponent 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.200
 First time, capturing rose and stained 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.380
 and of course we have successful as well as it should be different plague 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.050
 secured extremely dominant 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.650
 and would have Tower Compact 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.360
 Percent spent scores the typical definitely over London with 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.440
 Well what should I say great about it 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.110
 I look around here with a flash of shopping in the sand 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.770
 the box discussion would be red 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.070
 pursued in the remote duel 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.480
 and if the opponents did not all have servers switched 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.150
 Berlin and the dust around 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.390
 yes - protect 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.559
 helicopter pilots finally in the middle of the night with my pension market 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:13.419
 Reason responsible for the crisis 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.099
 Well, at least an assist creeps for that, that makes the guy so nice when we are 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.669
 shot down 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.830
 and I continue on my way 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.970
 Of course, we now have to consider which strategy we should take 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.570
 and those are now that no server is little you will be powerless again 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.609
 4 yes 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.509
 says Romana warrior flop 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.619
 and right a friend comes to help 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.559
 Of course he has to knife me away 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.839
 Anyone who sees them must also be aware of the focus 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.419
 that I play naked games 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.619
 I do not know if it was because the mountain mates had 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.969
 and yes why I think I have not met I know up in Kerpen 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.969
 suspected because the chamber is open and valued 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.569
 but unfortunately not mentioned 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.309
 works in any case 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.179
 yes, I'm trying to experience it with the helicopter now and now 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:02.019
 If you look closely what happens I now draw exactly on the left eye of the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.399
 Pilots like stress test too and what happened is just calling with that 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.729
 right eye on 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.379
 that's unfair 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.539
 you can not fool me here I have a change so Dreyer 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.769
 bräunlingen-döggingen made backwards 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.099
 Steffi Kammerer on and show you how to get through with the ballistic knife 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.099
 the area jump looks around the camera 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.319
 unfortunately a bit too high targeted but back to the Walek here 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.179
 «But with 34 points for Steger is just because so few are total 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.089
 dominant 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.699
 Under the type means kill and records server already with sorrow that 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.099
 they give me 30 points 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.249
 flanking the guys for many years already there are two people 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.779
 and again lets the server 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:44.960
 with a tool 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.329
 the second hit 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.809
 for the society 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.259
 nobody has met 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.689
 what else can you do? percent you can only play the game 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.639
 But I think that is extremely stupid in Arnsberg 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.359
 Ghasni projects around the rats out so Leuchtmann 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.329
 fumigate 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.679
 who has been shot of course I courageously go back rain 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.679
 and the type Ortes client are minimized 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.899
 trying to fill the well basin but that's not natural 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:18.749
 because with the touch up and running from orc fact Barth TSG Wehrheim says 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:20.419
 it's that easy 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.169
 and I'm being saved from all sides but I have the title 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.809
 what strength core get 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.569
 and I must say quite honestly from here was closing time from here was really 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.309
 end of working day 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.519
 Tor I think the thing Christmas again pulled off the socks 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.199
 There was a bit of filming here and from the ORF 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.460
 thanks, Sir Alex 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.569
 Not Bowles 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.729
 we have written down here 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.349
 I do not know what people say the titles even directly or whatever 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.469
 It definitely is an absolute impudence 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.379
 the chopper Gonzalez totally recognizes the cathedral is in the air and I'm mine 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.379
 I think I'm shooting once in the left leg 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.789
 business man with Marco Maier shot in the left leg 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.789
 then I want to shoot in the right leg 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.129
 we stay here now comes the 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.169
 the fine blade in the head 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.669
 quite clearly hit I realized it's not just about shooting so 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.199
 have to throw that from the ground under your feet 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.659
 but I must honestly say yes with the magic mountain would have a chance 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.139
 Concerned Thomas Schumann can definitely call thanks to my bad 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.339
 Teams region from 3 90 to 201 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.969
 I have two letters to complete but not because the last time 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.669
 give 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.229
 I've got it all by accident. "That was my first case sometime 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.460
 the next few weeks to make a second from the show Look mer times 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.370
 then it will come 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.599
