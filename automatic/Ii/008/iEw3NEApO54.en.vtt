00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
really great idea but what we don't tend

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.759 
really great idea but what we don't tend
to<00:02:38.849> think<00:02:38.940> about<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> acoustics<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> how

the sound bounces off all the hard
surfaces<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.560> great<00:02:43.739> idea<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.310> use

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
surfaces a really great idea is to use

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.100 
surfaces a really great idea is to use
drugs<00:02:44.819> because<00:02:45.329> not<00:02:45.480> only<00:02:45.510> does<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.870> look

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
drugs because not only does it look

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.080 
drugs because not only does it look
right<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.099> also<00:02:47.220> help<00:02:47.610> with<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> sound

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
