00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
virtual console that that makes me so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.040 
virtual console that that makes me so
happy<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.750> enough<00:02:34.590> like

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
happy but it's not enough like

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.740 
happy but it's not enough like
admittedly<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.370> do<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.910> some<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.540> newer

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
admittedly I do like some of the newer

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.250 
admittedly I do like some of the newer
games<00:02:40.020> order<00:02:40.470> better<00:02:41.160> than<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> older<00:02:41.610> games

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
games order better than the older games

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.710 
games order better than the older games

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
but many many more of the older games

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.080 
but many many more of the older games
are<00:02:45.900> better<00:02:46.370> they're<00:02:47.370> trying<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> make<00:02:47.910> stuff

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
are better they're trying to make stuff

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
are better they're trying to make stuff
either<00:02:48.450> too<00:02:48.750> complicated<00:02:49.170> or<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.620> trying<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
either too complicated or just trying to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.759 
either too complicated or just trying to
appeal<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.580> eyes<00:02:50.790> now<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.900> what's<00:02:52.709> a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
appeal to the eyes now like what's a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:53.330 
appeal to the eyes now like what's a
good<00:02:52.800> example

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
good example

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.970 
good example

rocked the one for the plantation that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.259 
rocked the one for the plantation that
one<00:03:00.300> was<00:03:00.420> good<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.130> ones<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.459> DS<00:03:02.700> I

the<00:03:33.720> touchscreen<00:03:33.930> for<00:03:34.260> almost<00:03:34.560> everything<00:03:35.250> in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the touchscreen for almost everything in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.680 
the touchscreen for almost everything in
it<00:03:35.730> bugged<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.510> crap<00:03:36.660> out<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.200> me<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.480> never

it bugged the crap out of me and I never
actually<00:03:40.170> finished<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.650> game<00:03:40.769> because<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
actually finished the game because of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.710
