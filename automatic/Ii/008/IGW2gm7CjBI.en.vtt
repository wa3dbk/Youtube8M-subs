00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.309
 here may be the ultrabook almost 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 perfect this summer 2015 is the shot at 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.349
 100 of toshiba and we will do a little 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.349
 owner's tower 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.580
 so this 13.3-inch ultrabook 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.580
 first seduced us by its finish 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.080
 aluminum and magnesium finesse lightness 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.670
 frankly there is not much to say 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 another good point of this laptop pc 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 who gathers 2 is the xxl size of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 his screen rather the definition of his 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 image 2560 among the four hundred 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.660
 forty pixels of what works with 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.190
 two open windows cot cot without 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 have to scroll like a sick person for 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.520
 able to read all the lines and then 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.170
 well for it to be almost perfect this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.329
 toshiba of course and lack of it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.410
 that endurance and he has it over eight 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.360
 hours in water of reading autonomy 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 video and a little over five hours and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 half in use says versatile it's up to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.550
 say sister is working more web and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.140
 frankly it still works 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 unfortunately who says almost perfect 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.039
 there is almost in and that's the screen 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.690
 who fish there too because the brightness 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.160
 is a little at half compared to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.600
 with very good contrast but contrasts 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.430
 brightness really not up to par 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 result we have a little impression that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.570
 the picture was always at the radius of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.650
 the screen there was a slight lack of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.630
 refreshment of the slab this is at 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.460
 to say that in fact when we play with the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.380
 touchscreen and well we have seen 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.520
 pink streaks the time all 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.320
 the colors stabilize and that the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 pixels is stabilizing so y'a that the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.170
 fussy who will see again in 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.430
 the others maybe it will go unnoticed 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.570
 but for a machine over 1200 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.939
 euros so it embarrassed us a bit 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.250
 finally impossible to find a machine 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.259
 with 16 gigabytes of memory in the range of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.540
 toshiba you have to be satisfied with 8 gigas 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.860
 or directly the motherboard alone 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.409
 element that we will be able to change is 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 the ssd we can go from 256 to 512 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 jitter spas just he will have 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.780
 think about cloning his system on the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.930
 again to try to do all these 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.930
 data 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.270
 then the kir to his de toshiba is 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.890
 sold 1200 euros but right now 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.659
 sales period is there way to find it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.850
 in the neighborhood of 1000 1100 euros 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.869
 it's not perfect but it is not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.869
 far and we love each other very much
