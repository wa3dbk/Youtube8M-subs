I<00:01:01.570> don't<00:01:01.780> know<00:01:01.899> why<00:01:02.109> and<00:01:02.469> then<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.489> get<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.850> 55

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
I don't know why and then you get the 55

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.560 
I don't know why and then you get the 55
to<00:01:05.140> 210<00:01:05.650> that's<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.790> that's<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.150> entire

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
to 210 that's it that's the entire

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:16.140 
to 210 that's it that's the entire
amount<00:01:09.510> lens<00:01:10.510> lineup<00:01:11.190> into<00:01:12.190> him<00:01:12.370> so<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:15.150> want

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
amount lens lineup into him so I want

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.840 
amount lens lineup into him so I want
more<00:01:16.330> lens<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.650> could<00:01:17.860> get<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.070> doctor<00:01:18.490> but

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
more lens you could get a doctor but

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.940 
more lens you could get a doctor but
then<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.180> run<00:01:19.360> into<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:20.020> quality<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.410> adapter

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
then you run into the quality of adapter

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.720 
then you run into the quality of adapter
and<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.970> lens<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:24.130> probably<00:01:24.400> either

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
and the lens that you probably either

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.850 
and the lens that you probably either
already<00:01:24.970> have<00:01:25.270> or<00:01:25.720> it's<00:01:26.260> not<00:01:26.380> worth<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:26.740> you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
already have or it's not worth it you

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.090 
already have or it's not worth it you
buy<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.430> my<00:01:27.670> opinion<00:01:28.000> just<00:01:28.420> for<00:01:28.690> this<00:01:29.230> so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
buy it in my opinion just for this so

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.210 
buy it in my opinion just for this so
not<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.420> lot<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.780> lens<00:01:32.110> connect<00:01:32.470> collection<00:01:32.860> but

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
not a lot of lens connect collection but

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.860 
not a lot of lens connect collection but
since<00:01:33.400> i<00:01:33.490> bought<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.730> they're<00:01:34.210> not<00:01:34.420> going<00:01:34.660> into

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
since i bought it they're not going into

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.360 
since i bought it they're not going into
that<00:01:34.990> Club<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.830> it's<00:01:36.550> fine<00:01:37.980> another<00:01:38.980> thing<00:01:39.190> is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
that Club so it's fine another thing is

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.000 
that Club so it's fine another thing is
the<00:01:39.400> electronic<00:01:40.180> viewfinder<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.560> great

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
the electronic viewfinder it is great

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.200 
the electronic viewfinder it is great
sometimes<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.900> not<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.650> great<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
sometimes it is not so great some of the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.540 
sometimes it is not so great some of the
times<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.780> um<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.740> has<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> lot<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.160> noise

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
times is that um it has a lot of noise

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.440 
times is that um it has a lot of noise
and<00:01:49.260> it's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:52.600> as<00:01:52.810> clear<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.740> then<00:01:53.980> there's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and it's not as clear and then there's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.450 
and it's not as clear and then there's
crop<00:01:55.450> factor<00:01:55.800> built<00:01:56.800> in<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:57.490> just<00:01:58.800> I've<00:01:59.800> been

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
crop factor built in it's just I've been

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.900 
crop factor built in it's just I've been
much<00:02:00.940> happier<00:02:01.180> if<00:02:01.750> this<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.020> optical<00:02:02.620> or<00:02:03.100> of

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
much happier if this is optical or of

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.390 
much happier if this is optical or of
the<00:02:04.240> old<00:02:04.480> ad<00:02:04.750> electronic<00:02:05.650> viewfinder<00:02:06.130> gets<00:02:06.340> a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
the old ad electronic viewfinder gets a

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.910 
the old ad electronic viewfinder gets a
little<00:02:06.520> bit<00:02:06.670> better<00:02:06.910> before<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.440> many<00:02:08.590> jumps

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
little bit better before so many jumps

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.619 
little bit better before so many jumps
onto<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.550> then<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.179> know<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.390> wish

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
onto it and then just you know I wish

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.890 
onto it and then just you know I wish
this<00:02:11.230> camera<00:02:11.650> were<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.250> 99<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.330> then<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.750> give

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
this camera were a 99 and then just give

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.430 
this camera were a 99 and then just give
me<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.200> optical<00:02:15.190> viewfinder

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
me a optical viewfinder

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220 
me a optical viewfinder
much<00:02:17.440> happier<00:02:17.770> that's<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> case<00:02:19.050> screen<00:02:20.050> I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
much happier that's the case screen I

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.640 
much happier that's the case screen I
wish<00:02:20.470> you'd<00:02:20.620> use<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.890> touchscreen<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
wish you'd use the touchscreen but it's

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.680 
wish you'd use the touchscreen but it's
not<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.520> biggest<00:02:24.760> button<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.570> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
not and the biggest button that the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.970

biggest<00:02:25.960> problem<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.230> have<00:02:26.440> was<00:02:26.650> with<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980

flash<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.780> event<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.230> don't<00:03:56.380> have

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
flash in the event that you don't have

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.240 
flash in the event that you don't have
one<00:03:58.049> another<00:03:59.049> problem<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.650> you<00:04:00.040> see

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
one another problem is that you see

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.009 
one another problem is that you see
these<00:04:00.430> two<00:04:00.790> control<00:04:01.180> dials<00:04:01.510> here<00:04:01.630> they<00:04:01.870> have

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
these two control dials here they have

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.470 
these two control dials here they have
no<00:04:02.230> marking<00:04:02.680> on<00:04:02.830> them<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.310> because<00:04:03.549> their

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
no marking on them it's because their

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.680 
no marking on them it's because their
function<00:04:04.900> changes<00:04:05.880> based<00:04:06.880> on<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.239> mold<00:04:07.510> that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
function changes based on the mold that

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.539 
function changes based on the mold that
you're<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:08.890> you're<00:04:09.010> an<00:04:09.070> aperture

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
you're in so if you're an aperture

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.030 
you're in so if you're an aperture
priority<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.870> thing<00:04:11.170> controls<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
priority this thing controls the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.270 
priority this thing controls the
aperture<00:04:12.519> this<00:04:13.120> controls<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:14.280> exposure

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
aperture this controls the exposure

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.210 
aperture this controls the exposure
compensation<00:04:17.700> well<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:19.350> would<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.829> to

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
compensation well I would like that to

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.310 
compensation well I would like that to
be<00:04:21.250> changed<00:04:21.910> because<00:04:22.030> when<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.479> mean<00:04:22.750> aperture

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
be changed because when I mean aperture

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.529 
be changed because when I mean aperture
priority<00:04:23.979> mode<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.640> like<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.300> be<00:04:25.419> an

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
priority mode I like this to be an

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.600 
priority mode I like this to be an
aperture<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.349> like<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:27.099> beat<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.430> ISO

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
aperture and I like this to beat the ISO

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.790 
aperture and I like this to beat the ISO
setting<00:04:28.150> but

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
setting but

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.159 
setting but
great<00:04:30.069> sony<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.879> made<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.300> soft<00:04:31.599> control

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
great sony you made the soft control

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.460 
great sony you made the soft control
button<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.800> button<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.639> dial<00:04:34.470> function

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
button so the button the dial function

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.890 
button so the button the dial function
changes<00:04:35.500> based<00:04:36.250> on<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.909> menu<00:04:37.270> or<00:04:37.569> the<00:04:37.599> mold

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
changes based on the menu or the mold

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.080 
changes based on the menu or the mold

allow<00:04:40.270> user<00:04:40.659> to<00:04:40.750> customize<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:44.460> whoa<00:04:45.460> that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
allow user to customize it so whoa that

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.110 
allow user to customize it so whoa that
seems<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:47.050> like<00:04:47.229> one<00:04:47.620> step<00:04:47.949> short<00:04:48.009> of<00:04:48.520> being

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
seems to be like one step short of being

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.170 
seems to be like one step short of being
a<00:04:49.300> perfect<00:04:49.569> camera<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.710> know<00:04:50.770> it's<00:04:50.949> like<00:04:51.180> yes

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
a perfect camera you know it's like yes

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.170 
a perfect camera you know it's like yes
this<00:04:52.780> just<00:04:53.740> all<00:04:53.949> software<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:54.879> we<00:04:55.000> don't

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
this just all software but we don't

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.330 
this just all software but we don't
allow<00:04:55.360> you<00:04:55.419> to<00:04:55.810> customize<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:57.870> great<00:05:00.720> so<00:05:01.720> I

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
allow you to customize it great so I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.820 
allow you to customize it great so I
don't<00:05:03.340> like<00:05:03.819> fat<00:05:04.150> but<00:05:04.870> then<00:05:05.020> again<00:05:05.199> since<00:05:05.710> the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
don't like fat but then again since the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.100 
don't like fat but then again since the
software<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.520> hope<00:05:07.300> Sony<00:05:07.539> fix<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.960> in<00:05:08.050> the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
software I hope Sony fix it in the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.339 
software I hope Sony fix it in the
future<00:05:08.229> or<00:05:09.419> someone<00:05:10.419> hacked<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.930> firmware

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
future or someone hacked the firmware

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.209 
future or someone hacked the firmware
release<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:13.110> custom<00:05:14.110> firmware<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:14.830> I<00:05:15.009> can

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
release a custom firmware so I can

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.490 
release a custom firmware so I can
change<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:16.000> function<00:05:16.479> of<00:05:16.599> this<00:05:16.750> two<00:05:17.050> dials

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500

be awesome you know either print it or

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.980 
be awesome you know either print it or
use<00:05:44.349> it<00:05:44.380> online<00:05:44.620> still<00:05:45.610> usable<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.509> pixels

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
use it online still usable the pixels

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.089 
use it online still usable the pixels
are<00:05:47.080> extremely<00:05:47.830> extremely<00:05:48.310> small<00:05:48.669> so<00:05:50.099> just

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
are extremely extremely small so just

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.100 
are extremely extremely small so just
that's<00:05:51.550> why<00:05:51.669> I<00:05:51.699> got<00:05:51.819> the<00:05:51.940> 16-millimeter<00:05:52.330> no

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
that's why I got the 16-millimeter no

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.170 
that's why I got the 16-millimeter no
