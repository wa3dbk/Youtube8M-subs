00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
winning performance and I think we are

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.510 
winning performance and I think we are
ready<00:05:22.180> for<00:05:22.600> that<00:05:22.750> challenge

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.060 

Singapore<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.550> one<00:05:31.730> of<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:31.940> toughest<00:05:32.240> razor<00:05:32.510> I

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.200 

you<00:07:26.900> know<00:07:27.020> Formula<00:07:27.380> One<00:07:27.470> World<00:07:27.710> title<00:07:28.310> is<00:07:28.460> it

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
you know Formula One World title is it

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.900 
you know Formula One World title is it
is<00:07:29.630> the<00:07:29.900> ultimate<00:07:30.020> goal<00:07:30.500> in<00:07:30.740> motorsport<00:07:31.400> and<00:07:31.700> I

think this moment is the beginning of

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.790 
think this moment is the beginning of
the<00:07:35.150> realization<00:07:35.990> of<00:07:36.080> actually<00:07:36.530> what<00:07:36.680> he's

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
the realization of actually what he's
