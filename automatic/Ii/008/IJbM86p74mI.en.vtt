00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 blow everyone is your vision is 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.819
 found again in my 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.049
 company for a new tutorial for a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.360
 new video today is one to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.210
 look at how a little bit 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.130
 remove a partition from a hard drive 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 so what does that mean already 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 partition of a hard drive and well that's 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.689
 just look look here I have 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.269
 a local hard drive that makes 29 that makes 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 by which 190 giga and basically in fact 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.189
 there we do 240 but I chose to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.080
 a little bit cut in two yes finally to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 cut in half cut into pieces my 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 disc like anything you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.260
 take with a knife and cut it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.489
 and so I have here it's called 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 to partition but in fact that means 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.440
 chunk out his hard drive 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.489
 uncle to you see I have another 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.850
 next disc but in fact it's the same 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.579
 it's just virtual it's the disk where 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 I had far cry but I'm starting 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.149
 to be a little bit of gestures in the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.399
 first so I said go hop I'm going 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.140
 come back all this is so I'm going to you 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.940
 show right away how we do 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.899
 so I had a little trouble this morning 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 on forums etc 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 but I was able and in the end I managed 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.729
 so be aware that I'm on 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.439
 windows 8 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.140
 and yes I wanted to put myself 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.850
 a little bit up to date but it's 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.729
 no big deal so you go in if 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.080
 you're in on windows 7 you're going 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.070
 click on the start menu open the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.580
 control panel 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.920
 so me here is where there no excuse me 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 up can put it in big we will go 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.490
 in the system and security on windows 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.299
 7 believe it's something like that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 also and there we do not go in 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.210
 sworn storage space species of 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.270
 storage we go in tools 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 administration 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.369
 alas once we are tools 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.820
 of administration or go into the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.159
 computer management and we go in 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.939
 storage on the left and we click on 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.259
 disk management 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 So here we have our 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.960
 small hard drive to turn a little bit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.979
 and loaded it all the discs there 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.520
 so it was very simple to 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.640
 understand 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.799
 it's like on our computer so if 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.180
 I do that we'll see better so when 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.250
 you see that the disc c it is there the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.960
 disc I know which one to format me 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 finally the one we want to gather 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.520
 it is there and there where there is far cry so that 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.990
 it's my record that my reader 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.150
 disk under the cell 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.420
 system with windows on it and that's 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.810
 my hard drive that I have of covers 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.190
 just record my videos 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.140
 so now it's pretty simple in 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.460
 do we go right click on disk 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.020
 hard or finally the one you want to gather 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.880
 have done right click and actually remove 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.170
 the volume and there we tell you well 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.950
 obviously that it will be deleted and c 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.050
 is there we see that we still have not 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.700
 the giga together that is to say that the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:52.290
 see it at 198 giga again but 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.000
 we have 24.71 gia which are useless 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.310
 allocated so now it takes 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.980
 enlarge the score so we click on 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.100
 the c and stretch the volume and we will 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.580
 extend it like that and that's it 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.950
 and now we have 223 giga look 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
 it's magic 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.290
 hop we'll do a little 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.990
 refreshment and we have 200 23 and 54 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.450
 giga free so it's very very 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.420
 simple it's really I discovered that 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.650
 this morning on a small forum but I was 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.610
 a little skeptical but because I 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.590
 thought it was necessary to reformat everything 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.590
 everything I was there it'll be galley to everything 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.540
 wet my record was even been 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.650
 really full and oussalah all formatted 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.760
 that's all really really it's 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.020
 really very well I thought that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.510
 I was going to go through the bios etc 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.250
 but in truth that tile is hyper easy 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.710
 she so I'll tell you ciao the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.690
 next door, see you soon for 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.360
 a new tutorial for new video I 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.450
 think about battle cry 3 on aftermath or 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.190
 still a little bit on far cry and very 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.170
 soon on war z ranking released the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.300
 horde of zombies I'm in a hurry to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.490
 to show you that it's really excellent 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.000
 go ciao take care of yourself and the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.000
 next
