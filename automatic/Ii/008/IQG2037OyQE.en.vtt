00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 I did not miss anything I had the money on 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.629
 success is a beautiful wife because 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.610
 we have to take a vacation, you know it 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 they are lost convents but then a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.160
 day he arrives dear as he was 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.350
 the atmosphere with pipes and sergio all in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 as an actor he loves actors so he loves 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.650
 the actor's work then has fun 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 then to build the scene with the actor 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 automatically creates a climate of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.930
 Work of fun and desire to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.700
 do and among other things then 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.830
 and less so in the demanding statute 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.870
 to find a very demanding president 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.420
 of the river director, however, you feel like it 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.850
 to get to what he intense 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.440
 I had because he is so passionate 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.810
 especially in the proper part of the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.080
 acting of the nuances 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.050
 those things that point a lot 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.670
 important in the worker 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 I ask to find them so it was 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:02.170
 obviously roads trickle but we can 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.180
 of the sergio set makes you do 30,000 claps 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.670
 he's used to it every time he's already there 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.369
 call yourself prepare yourself spiritually or 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.500
 no no try at least here are another 30 thousand 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.630
 because I have recently seen the waves of 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.390
 off-stage of habemus papam 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.770
 ah here they are high but it was a 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.240
 reason now I don't want to take away the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.250
 word daisy there was a reason for 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.440
 which we repeated in ciak and I lived 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.910
 for the few dinners I have had 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.259
 with merit every so often when 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.330
 she improvised she was laughing 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.360
 fun to live for his laugh 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.240
 but oh well because in short I often do 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.760
 even a very intimate film in short 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.110
 rather sad atmospheres bye so 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.939
 here then instead they found themselves in 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.400
 climb where if you are video we do this 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.600
 hallucinatory things because no but 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.979
 however I don't message a person a lot 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.549
 know what he wants then until he does 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.549
 he got it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.690
 the good, however, is a person 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.450
 rather quiet on this is not that 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.030
 be obsessive in the repetition of the claps 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.050
 please forgive me for what you are like 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.360
 I am 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.090
 He had a film on how to cure 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.740
 antagonists because I think how 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.480
 saw learn to know ours 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.590
 enemy is not an ethical diktat but is a 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380
 emani knows our enemy 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.000
 disable antagonism and even one 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.250
 way to live better because 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.800
 antagonism consumes us wears us out for 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.230
 which is more moral than my film 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.770
 there are utilitarian reasons 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.700
 so in my opinion it is more advice for 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.200
 how to live better 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.970
 I always wanted that in the damn themes 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.610
 the day I met you in this 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 character faced the saux fear and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.920
 terror of everything in the midst of a certain 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.720
 point we begin to face it 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.040
 began to see horror movies in between 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.690
 he went to England 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.180
 if you are so like an actress if you like it 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.709
 face roles that are challenging and 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.540
 that you put fear there are 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.580
 those who put you in fear but none 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.720
 all the roles of fear cialis e 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.280
 one always has the feeling of not 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.500
 to be able to do certain then I have not 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.470
 never exposed perhaps to things for me too 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.010
 complicated too much beyond mine 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.620
 possibility however I mean 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.950
 now I would be very ready to do too 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.069
 things totally different from those 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.110
 which I've done so far is a bit too 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.420
 this role in his small way however is a 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.269
 flight that for me say ten years ago 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.709
 in short, it was unthinkable to do it now 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.720
 I feel no vain question ready 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.370
 read together in ruminants inspires 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.200
 you can also go through the car 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.959
 camera is half a mind you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.519
 would like to watch saliva done immediately 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.930
 that is, in the sense that we have him and I think 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.239
 that he already had this goal 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.290
 just started 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.670
 so he gave me the station when 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.129
 let's do the station the theater already had 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.319
 the idea of ​​making a movie so you go to 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.480
 directing so many people 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.819
 certainly the straight stripes are not a leader 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.739
 I do not like to stay right on behalf 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.889
 mine and have little to do with him 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.750
 others for which the idea of being on the set 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.069
 however, every day of things can 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.639
 be that one day I feel like 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.659
 tell a story and try to do it 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.659
 but I don't doubt
