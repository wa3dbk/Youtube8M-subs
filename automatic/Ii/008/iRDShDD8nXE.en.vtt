that you're looking at this combination

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.680 
that you're looking at this combination
the<00:02:45.310> awning<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.540> cabin<00:02:46.989> combined<00:02:48.690> it's

connected to the trailer you only set

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.850 
connected to the trailer you only set
the<00:02:58.570> only<00:02:58.840> separate<00:02:59.200> pole<00:02:59.440> you've<00:02:59.590> got<00:02:59.709> on<00:02:59.800> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
whole system is this is which is called

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.750 
whole system is this is which is called
the<00:03:01.600> key<00:03:01.810> pole<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:02.830> just<00:03:03.040> connect<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.580> two

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
the key pole so you just connect the two

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.130 
the key pole so you just connect the two
halves<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.209> camp<00:03:04.480> lit<00:03:04.630> together

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
connect one into there connect that into

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
connect one into there connect that into
the<00:03:07.989> edge<00:03:08.080> push<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.530> down<00:03:09.959> zip<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.080> back<00:03:11.170> up

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the edge push it down zip it back up

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.759 
the edge push it down zip it back up
