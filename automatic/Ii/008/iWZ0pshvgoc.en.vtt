00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
made of Canada squirrel and they are

made of Canada squirrel and they are
also<00:00:15.509> from<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.900> flagship<00:00:16.410> series<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
also from the flagship series with the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.179 
also from the flagship series with the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
24 karat plated gold ferrule the orange

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
24 karat plated gold ferrule the orange
handle<00:00:20.550> hand<00:00:21.000> painted<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.810> little<00:00:21.990> decal<00:00:22.410> on

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
handle hand painted the little decal on

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.140 
handle hand painted the little decal on
the<00:00:22.740> end<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.970> think<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.090> are

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
the end and the I think these are

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.870 
the end and the I think these are
probably<00:00:28.019> decals<00:00:28.800> or<00:00:29.130> maybe<00:00:29.490> their<00:00:29.670> hand

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
probably decals or maybe their hand

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.680 
probably decals or maybe their hand
painted<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> beverly<00:00:30.900> hills<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> MS<00:00:32.690> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
painted the beverly hills and the MS the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
painted the beverly hills and the MS the
little<00:00:33.899> model<00:00:34.260> number<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> over<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.640> on

little model number is over here so on

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.430 
little model number is over here so on
both<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.750> said<00:00:36.780> they're<00:00:37.170> made<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
both of these as I said they're made of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860 
both of these as I said they're made of
Canada<00:00:37.800> squirrel<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
Canada squirrel which is all the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.630 
Canada squirrel which is all the
squirrel<00:00:40.260> hairs<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.739> how<00:00:40.950> cool<00:00:41.100> hoto<00:00:41.309> uses

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
squirrel hairs that how cool hoto uses

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.630 
squirrel hairs that how cool hoto uses
are<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.290> ridiculously<00:00:43.290> soft<00:00:43.620> hair<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.280> these

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
are like ridiculously soft hair so these

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.750 
are like ridiculously soft hair so these
are<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.450> soft<00:00:45.870> brushes<00:00:46.760> these

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
are very very very soft brushes these

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
are very very very soft brushes these
two<00:00:48.000> brushes<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.750> opinion<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.010> my

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
two brushes in my opinion so in my

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
two brushes in my opinion so in my
opinion<00:00:50.610> these<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:50.910> brushes<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.390> nearly

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
opinion these two brushes are nearly

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.279 
opinion these two brushes are nearly
identical<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.730> website<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> lists<00:00:54.989> that

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
identical on the website it lists that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.020 
identical on the website it lists that
their<00:00:55.530> difference<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> only<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.789> millimeter

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
their difference is only one millimeter

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.700 
their difference is only one millimeter
in<00:00:57.390> length<00:00:57.570> pretty<00:00:58.320> much<00:00:58.530> so<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> definitely

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
in length pretty much so you definitely

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
in length pretty much so you definitely
I<00:01:02.070> don't<00:01:02.250> think<00:01:02.609> would<00:01:02.760> need<00:01:02.910> both<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> these

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
I don't think would need both of these

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.200 
I don't think would need both of these
brushes<00:01:03.719> by<00:01:04.170> any<00:01:04.409> means<00:01:04.680> they're<00:01:05.549> both<00:01:05.760> very

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
brushes by any means they're both very

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.770 
brushes by any means they're both very
nice<00:01:06.420> brushes<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.439> terms<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:08.130> quality<00:01:08.790> quality

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
nice brushes in terms of quality quality

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.500 
nice brushes in terms of quality quality
of<00:01:09.869> hair<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.860> taper<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.369> beautiful<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510

brushes<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.990> Mac<00:01:21.860> 139

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
brushes so my Mac 139

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
brushes so my Mac 139
I<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:23.939> 139<00:01:24.540> hold<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> second<00:01:25.259> by<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:26.270> number

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
I think 139 hold a second by my number

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
I think 139 hold a second by my number
fell<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> by<00:01:28.560> Mac<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
fell off it's the one by Mac that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
fell off it's the one by Mac that
everybody<00:01:29.220> has<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> lays<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.700> color<00:01:30.600> very

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
everybody has it lays down color very

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.499 
everybody has it lays down color very
well<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.829> favorite<00:01:32.009> for

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
well this is like my favorite for

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.390 
well this is like my favorite for
packing<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.630> colored<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.280> see

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
packing on colored but so you can see

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550 
packing on colored but so you can see
they're<00:01:35.549> bigger<00:01:35.759> than<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
they're bigger than that and then this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.270 
they're bigger than that and then this
is<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> Mac<00:01:38.070> 217

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
is the Mac 217

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
is the Mac 217
so<00:01:41.280> they're<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.729> shorter<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.259> they're<00:01:43.409> not

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
so they're bit shorter so they're not

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
so they're bit shorter so they're not
super<00:01:44.189> long<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.820> anything<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
super long or anything like that and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.190 
super long or anything like that and
then<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> 217<00:01:46.740> turned<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> side<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.200> then

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
then the 217 turned to the side and then

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.920 
then the 217 turned to the side and then
the<00:01:49.500> 217<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.430> made<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> goat<00:01:50.909> hair<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the 217 is made of goat hair so that

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
the 217 is made of goat hair so that
means<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> hairs<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.860> thicker<00:01:53.189> than

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
means that the hairs are thicker than

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
means that the hairs are thicker than
the<00:01:54.180> hairs<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.600> canada<00:01:55.020> squirrel<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.530> even

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the hairs of canada squirrel so even

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.740 
the hairs of canada squirrel so even
though<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.610> look<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> ferrule<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
though you look down at the ferrule and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.749 
though you look down at the ferrule and
it<00:01:57.899> looks<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.409> they're<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.520> same

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it looks like they're about the same

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
it looks like they're about the same
thickness<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.020> may<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.290> little<00:02:01.380> bit

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
thickness this one may be a little bit

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.560 
thickness this one may be a little bit
more<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.250> gonna<00:02:02.490> seem<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.390> are

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
more it's gonna seem like these are

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.020 
more it's gonna seem like these are
thinner<00:02:03.869> because<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.950> actual<00:02:05.369> hairs<00:02:05.700> are

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
thinner because the actual hairs are

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.270 
thinner because the actual hairs are
thinner<00:02:06.500> hopefully<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.680> makes<00:02:07.860> sense<00:02:08.039> like

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
thinner hopefully that makes sense like

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.770 
thinner hopefully that makes sense like
these<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.789> look<00:02:09.030> skinny<00:02:09.360> cuz<00:02:09.629> they

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
these don't just look skinny cuz they

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.150 
these don't just look skinny cuz they
were<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.110> washed<00:02:10.379> i<00:02:10.619> mean<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.009> what

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
were just washed i mean this is what

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.620 
were just washed i mean this is what
it's<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> keep<00:02:11.640> looking<00:02:11.849> like

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
it's going to keep looking like

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.600 
it's going to keep looking like
whereas<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.290> Mac<00:02:13.500> one<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.100> going<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.400> look

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
whereas the Mac one is going to look

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.030 
whereas the Mac one is going to look
fluffier<00:02:15.150> regardless<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.470> know<00:02:16.560> think<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
fluffier regardless you know think of a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.430 
fluffier regardless you know think of a
girl<00:02:17.280> who<00:02:17.520> has<00:02:17.730> very<00:02:18.000> thin<00:02:18.360> hair<00:02:18.600> versus<00:02:19.410> a

brushes<00:02:40.830> very<00:02:41.820> much<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.480> because<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.430> just

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
brushes very much just because I just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.030 
brushes very much just because I just
based<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.760> my<00:02:44.820> brush<00:02:45.210> preferences<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.410> don't

have<00:02:47.250> much<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.700> use<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:48.090> these<00:02:48.180> brushes

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
have much of a use for these brushes

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.470 
have much of a use for these brushes
things<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.460> imagined<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.030> could<00:02:51.240> use

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
things that I imagined you could use

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.860 
things that I imagined you could use
them<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.890> would<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.070> highlight<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:54.750> would

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
them for would be a highlight it would

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
them for would be a highlight it would
be<00:02:54.960> beautiful<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.680> highlights<00:02:56.040> very<00:02:56.400> soft

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
be beautiful for highlights very soft

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.910 
be beautiful for highlights very soft
you<00:02:57.660> could<00:02:57.870> even<00:02:58.050> use<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.440> probably<00:02:58.800> to

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
you could even use it probably to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.920 
you could even use it probably to
highlight<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.520> guess<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.240> face<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
highlight I guess your face but it is a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.230 
highlight I guess your face but it is a
little<00:03:01.110> bit<00:03:01.230> small<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:02.820> just<00:03:03.030> not

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
little bit small for that it's just not

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.120 
little bit small for that it's just not
everything<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.230> would<00:03:04.380> use<00:03:04.680> these<00:03:04.800> for<00:03:05.100> I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
everything that I would use these for I

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.800 
everything that I would use these for I
have<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> brush<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.270> little<00:03:06.450> bit<00:03:06.630> more

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
have a brush that's a little bit more

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.140 
have a brush that's a little bit more
ideal<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> prefer<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.070> use<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.820> that's<00:03:08.940> why

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
ideal that I prefer to use so that's why

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.840 
ideal that I prefer to use so that's why
I<00:03:09.180> say<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.830> know<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.010> could<00:03:11.250> use<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.640> to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
I say I'm you know you could use this to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.900 
I say I'm you know you could use this to
pack<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.270> color<00:03:12.540> onto<00:03:12.960> your<00:03:13.290> lid<00:03:13.560> if<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.920> had<00:03:14.520> a

very you know very very buttery i shadow
x'<00:03:18.600> however<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:20.400> not<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.180> easiest<00:03:21.690> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
x' however it's not like the easiest to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.990 
x' however it's not like the easiest to
use<00:03:22.320> for<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:23.190> i<00:03:23.370> prefer<00:03:23.610> something

use for that like i prefer something

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.310 
use for that like i prefer something
quicker<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.870> easier<00:03:25.260> such<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.130> my<00:03:26.250> Mac<00:03:27.320> -

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
quicker and easier such as my Mac -

quicker and easier such as my Mac -
let's<00:03:29.070> see<00:03:29.190> what<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.460> it<00:03:29.610> 2:38<00:03:30.210> I<00:03:30.420> think<00:03:30.750> or<00:03:31.440> 239

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
let's see what is it 2:38 I think or 239

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.580 
let's see what is it 2:38 I think or 239
my<00:03:33.000> number<00:03:33.270> wore<00:03:33.450> off<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:33.870> whatever<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.440> one

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
my number wore off so whatever that one

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.080 
my number wore off so whatever that one
is<00:03:34.770> that's<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.210> um<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.700> prefer

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
is that's the one that um that I prefer

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.170 
is that's the one that um that I prefer
to<00:03:39.120> use<00:03:39.240> for<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.780> purpose<00:03:40.400> also<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.970> very

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
to use for this purpose also it's very

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940 
to use for this purpose also it's very
soft<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.870> could<00:03:43.110> cut<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> crease<00:03:43.620> with<00:03:43.800> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
soft so you could cut the crease with it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.090 
soft so you could cut the crease with it
technically<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:45.570> know<00:03:45.690> because<00:03:46.140> they<00:03:46.410> they

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
technically you know because they they

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.190 
technically you know because they they
do<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.120> can<00:03:48.300> easily<00:03:48.510> cut<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.990> crease

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
do this so you can easily cut the crease

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.470 
do this so you can easily cut the crease
with<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.560> because<00:03:50.220> even<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:50.880> way
