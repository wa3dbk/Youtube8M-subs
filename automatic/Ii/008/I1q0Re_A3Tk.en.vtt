 And it seems the facts are a bit too 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.810
 leave on a march where your car 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.529
 through handlebar 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529
 only in this case 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 it will be natural again 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.560
 come true is an idea my catchers is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.560
 made by neighboring country 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.570
 find out 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.880
 yes yes good day in conversation with eric 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.010
 struijs van roeland from eight times 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.590
 have things and eric yes we are here 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.440
 with the cow 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.840
 street and that is an idea that she is 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.739
 developed by you together with the bag 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.170
 having sex with 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.330
 poorly awake and then car wash that is possible 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.339
 then a car wash of course I will 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.470
 his dog wash there to see where the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.050
 cow was this was news 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.910
 Well it's crazy came up with the idea to 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.180
 us from what i actually want something 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.610
 innovate and my school does 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.440
 good street making you want to help us 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.410
 you realize that you can help develop further 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.480
 the found 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.910
 so invert and yes 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.010
 these plaques always stemmed from yes 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.930
 we it is it is a single product agenda 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.570
 so no two things the first first 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.490
 world you go through is very special because yes 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.290
 is actually designed with the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.900
 thought when you say well it comes 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.940
 cow welfare for good it 's the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.120
 so cows want when they come in 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.360
 first posselt 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.640
 six 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.230
 brushed 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.080
 and 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.440
 well then the cows can become then 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.380
 I don't have to walk away with water 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.590
 man 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 in and dance with the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.230
 I had little or blue bath and then 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.790
 cleaned up a claw 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.830
 and yes then we can in principle the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.960
 Car wash regularly in they cook it 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.010
 crops and everything else is 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.010
 dried or photo 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.250
 a ventilation system it is for though 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.200
 that turning the passion into 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.480
 automatically 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.319
 start also is the centrosomes 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.629
 because yes that is something 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.269
 how often do you have in mind that what 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.579
 is going to happen how often did a cow then 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.950
 cows have to go through such long sentences 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.519
 nothing mother missed him wanting to be free again 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.379
 track-hd that is the forest floor emma was up 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.709
 stand there to be brushed here 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.540
 years old so that is a free system we 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.450
 want yes but how 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.469
 Grab your style now a theory that it 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.879
 also like it 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.950
 actually more or less in line 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.620
 for something so yes and you know what the new 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.860
 the van text is completely new 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.350
 we must do that too 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.570
 of all traces 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.880
 with looking believe yes you expect 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.950
 through the market when I think yes 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.410
 am really asking yes 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.240
 give boys 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.950
 how long have you been with us for years? 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.050
 been busy putting it together like this 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.060
 like and shame well I think the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.000
 first conversations that are all I think 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.600
 and have been three quarters of years ago 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.819
 and yes 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.939
 to be 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.430
 and drugs in the good yes yes that 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.989
 is a bit closer to walking and hosters 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.790
 yes, we are closer now 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.859
 stand up and view here on the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.019
 brushes the cow comes to volunteer one 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.209
 let's look under the region 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.519
 to no cars or in the woods and 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.700
 electric cell that you the rates but 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.109
 rotate the brush without starting 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.489
 and therefore also becomes water immediately 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.290
 I tensed that he 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.000
 nature and struggled with is actually is 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.920
 the pure and the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.130
 keep the first and so or too 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.660
 remove and 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.680
 and if they then run that game then it becomes 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.660
 was good ajax at home and then we go 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.660
 continue along the along that along the line 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.020
 prepared here 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.520
 location thumb that is again a photos 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.260
 of looking to be normally they 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.770
 For a long time I also have watering 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.340
 on and then they actually become 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.769
 look with a kind of Lego radius than 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.840
 twitter day above all to the fan 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.540
 ah just gotta blow the foot then again 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.400
 more or less dry and how long does it take 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.230
 processes and we are therefore influencing 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.550
 as early as once inside his finger 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.650
 principle most beautiful plus 10 minutes nothing 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.120
 from yayasan so it is completely free will 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.980
 I find this very nice among the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.030
 chest then yes then they stay there 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.790
 stand 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.070
 oh yes very durable go check it here 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.050
 I will actually assume if 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.100
 the stable is put into use with the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.790
 cows 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.530
 This also comes in there is direct 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.570
 you will also be curious because 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.340
 it is of course to my first year 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.950
 a prototype and very curious how you 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.170
 respond to the cows 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.210
 Yes asks you off course 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.990
 used the necessary energy I think yes 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.520
 dad tawny jannes if you stand in it like 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.350
 I 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.700
 it strikes me that bad yes and then she 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.160
 had use on the road 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.830
 well baked is just one 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.330
 water recycle systems the schooner 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.860
 meet someone talk to or call you 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.629

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.969
 understood the out and development fund 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.839
 of a spirit or a certain kind 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.919
 appear on chili 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:40.660
 yes with the eps an integral sustainable 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.580
 stables and day 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.590
 Well here I am very curious will 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.450
 I will definitely long a time for 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.410
 do you ever look bad in practice 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.540
