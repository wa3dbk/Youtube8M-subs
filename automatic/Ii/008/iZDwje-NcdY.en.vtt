00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
now it happens that the hiking pole that

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240 
now it happens that the hiking pole that
I<00:00:12.420> like<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.840> use<00:00:12.990> most<00:00:13.290> often<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.830> something<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
I like to use most often is something is

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.890 
I like to use most often is something is
called<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.639> pacer<00:00:15.089> pole<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.480> has<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> very

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
called a pacer pole and has a very

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080 
called a pacer pole and has a very
different<00:00:16.199> handle<00:00:16.859> than<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.789> fact<00:00:17.940> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
different handle than this in fact it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.760 
different handle than this in fact it
was<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> long<00:00:18.539> time<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:19.140> me<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.410> figure<00:00:19.560> out

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
was a long time for me to figure out

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279 
was a long time for me to figure out
just<00:00:19.800> how<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:21.090> could<00:00:21.480> use<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:22.050> pace

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
just how it is that I could use my pace

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.550 
just how it is that I could use my pace
to<00:00:22.439> pull<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> spreader<00:00:23.850> bar<00:00:24.090> because<00:00:24.560> here's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
to pull as a spreader bar because here's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.830 
to pull as a spreader bar because here's
the<00:00:25.769> handle<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:27.150> know<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.480> wonderful

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the handle you know it's a wonderful

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.470 
the handle you know it's a wonderful
thing<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> grip<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.609> how<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:29.939> we

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
thing got a grip like so but how do we

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
thing got a grip like so but how do we
how<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.289> Center<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> force<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
how do we Center the force is the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.610 
how do we Center the force is the
problem<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> solution<00:00:34.410> for

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
problem and so I have a solution for

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.160 
problem and so I have a solution for
that<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.160> I'll<00:00:35.370> show<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that and I'll show you that so the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.900 
that and I'll show you that so the
patient<00:00:37.350> prole<00:00:37.680> comes<00:00:37.950> apart<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
patient prole comes apart just as this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.950 
patient prole comes apart just as this
lucky<00:00:39.420> did<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:40.890> dog<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.219> insert<00:00:41.960> slide

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
lucky did and my dog will insert slide

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
lucky did and my dog will insert slide
it<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:48.320> then<00:00:49.320> shove<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> all<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.340> way

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it in and then shove it all the way

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.360 
it in and then shove it all the way
until<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:51.960> farther<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> then

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
until we're going off farther and then

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.290 
until we're going off farther and then
twist<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:55.399> tightly<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.520> it'll<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.910> until

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
twist it as tightly as it'll go until

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900 
twist it as tightly as it'll go until
it's<00:00:57.600> completely<00:00:58.350> firmed<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> other

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it's completely firmed now on the other

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
end right here we have another piece of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
end right here we have another piece of
dowel<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.670> need<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.059> doll<00:01:03.390> for

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
dowel that's in here need more doll for

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.830

right here in a ways it will see as you
can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.549> I've<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> polyester

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
can see I've got a bit of polyester

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920 
can see I've got a bit of polyester
record<00:01:23.040> 1<00:01:23.250> inch<00:01:23.430> polyester<00:01:24.119> core<00:01:24.299> strong<00:01:24.600> cord

record 1 inch polyester core strong cord
it<00:01:25.740> has<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> particular<00:01:26.990> topology<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it has a particular topology to it and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.899 
it has a particular topology to it and
it's<00:01:29.220> sewn<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.100> thinking<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.369> terms<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
it's sewn on and so thinking in terms of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's sewn on and so thinking in terms of
this<00:01:33.420> being<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> inside<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.280> where<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this being the inside this is where the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.380 
this being the inside this is where the
the<00:01:36.750> webbing<00:01:36.930> has<00:01:37.170> been<00:01:37.350> folded<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.670> sewn

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the webbing has been folded in and sewn

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.880 
the webbing has been folded in and sewn
as<00:01:39.659> opposed<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> outside<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.770> might

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
as opposed to the outside you might

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.160 
as opposed to the outside you might
think<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> wrong<00:01:41.729> side<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.420> sewing

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
think of it as the wrong side in sewing

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
think of it as the wrong side in sewing
and<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.130> pointing<00:01:44.729> towards<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> tree

and with this pointing towards the tree

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.940 
and with this pointing towards the tree
then<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.770> does<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:48.899> bring<00:01:49.860> the

is I'm going to pass the pole through

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.639 
is I'm going to pass the pole through
this<00:02:04.770> loop<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.340> through<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.509> ring<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.079> then

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
this loop and through that ring and then

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.210 
this loop and through that ring and then
I<00:02:07.680> will<00:02:07.920> fix<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.420> webbing<00:02:10.379> here<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.770> top<00:02:11.009> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I will fix the webbing here on top of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.760 
I will fix the webbing here on top of
the<00:02:11.340> pole

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.290 

so<00:02:14.770> there's<00:02:14.980> my<00:02:15.160> loop<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:17.020> goes<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.680> tip<00:02:18.300> it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
so there's my loop and goes the tip it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.000 
so there's my loop and goes the tip it
goes<00:02:19.570> through<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.960> ring<00:02:20.170> as<00:02:20.380> well<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.830> can

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
goes through the ring as well you can

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.980 
goes through the ring as well you can
see<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:22.510> pass<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.960> pole<00:02:23.410> through<00:02:24.990> getting

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
see now pass the pole through getting

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.440 
see now pass the pole through getting
closer<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.500> closer<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.160> head<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:30.450> we've

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
closer and closer to the head and we've

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.510 
closer and closer to the head and we've
got<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.320> orange<00:02:34.290> handle<00:02:35.290> want<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.310> pass

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
got this this orange handle want to pass

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.750 
got this this orange handle want to pass
that<00:02:36.850> through<00:02:37.120> here<00:02:37.360> get<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.930> way

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
that through here get it out of the way

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.300 
that through here get it out of the way
and<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:39.940> work<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.330> up<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.130> we're

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and we work this up and now we're

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.570 
and we work this up and now we're
getting<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> point<00:02:42.940> where<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:44.560> have<00:02:44.830> these

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
getting to the point where we have these

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.330 
getting to the point where we have these
folds<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.480> I'm<00:02:47.260> going<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.500> fold<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:48.070> over

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
folds and I'm going to fold it up over

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.520 
folds and I'm going to fold it up over
the<00:02:49.090> bottom<00:02:49.770> palm<00:02:50.770> edge<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.990> pace<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.380> pool

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the bottom palm edge of the pace of pool

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.130 
the bottom palm edge of the pace of pool
like<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:56.910> now<00:02:57.910> with<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.120> little<00:02:58.270> flip<00:02:58.870> thing

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
like so now with a little flip thing

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.840 
like so now with a little flip thing
about<00:02:59.380> I<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.780> Center<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.850> webbing

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
about I can do is I can Center a webbing

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.110 
about I can do is I can Center a webbing
over<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> pandal<00:03:05.290> over<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.830> pole<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.370> so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
over the pandal over the pole and so

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.020 
over the pandal over the pole and so
when<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.690> under<00:03:07.960> force<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.760> force

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
when this is under force then the force

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.570 
when this is under force then the force
will<00:03:10.300> be<00:03:10.480> transmitted<00:03:11.410> down<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.040> center<00:03:12.400> of

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
will be transmitted down the center of

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.150 
will be transmitted down the center of
the<00:03:13.150> pole<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:14.260> poles<00:03:14.470> gone<00:03:14.710> through<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the pole and the poles gone through the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.130 
the pole and the poles gone through the
ring<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.270> now<00:03:16.420> I'll<00:03:16.570> put<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:16.930> all

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
ring and so now I'll put this all

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.479 
ring and so now I'll put this all
together<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.100> see<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.400> it

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
together and you can see that it

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.880 
together and you can see that it
actually<00:03:18.520> works<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.540> need<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.959> dispatch<00:03:23.140> my

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
actually works so I need to dispatch my

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.210 
actually works so I need to dispatch my
suspension<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:24.670> I'll<00:03:24.730> get<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> soft<00:03:25.239> shackle

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
suspension so I'll get the soft shackle

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.280 
suspension so I'll get the soft shackle
it<00:03:27.220> comes<00:03:27.520> off

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.110 

now<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.319> need<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.650> attach<00:03:35.129> this<00:03:35.489> ring<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:36.000> I'm

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
now I need to attach this ring what I'm

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.690 
now I need to attach this ring what I'm
going<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.299> do<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.629> I'm<00:03:37.230> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.469> loop<00:03:38.129> this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
going to do is I'm going to loop this

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.869 
going to do is I'm going to loop this
piece<00:03:39.420> right<00:03:39.659> around<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.409> ring<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.700> do

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
piece right around this ring so to do

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:49.729 
piece right around this ring so to do
that<00:03:41.909> I<00:03:42.359> need<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.900> unhook<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:48.560> put<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.590> on

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
that I need to unhook it and put it on

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.349 
that I need to unhook it and put it on
the<00:03:49.859> side<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:52.200> I'll<00:03:52.319> rehook<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:53.359> these

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
the side and then I'll rehook it these

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.789 
the side and then I'll rehook it these
soft<00:03:54.689> shackles<00:03:55.109> are<00:03:55.230> great<00:03:55.379> aren't<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:56.329> so

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
soft shackles are great aren't they so

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.410 
soft shackles are great aren't they so
now<00:03:58.799> I've<00:03:59.010> got<00:04:00.409> the<00:04:01.409> topology<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.189> needed

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
now I've got the topology that I needed

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.050 
now I've got the topology that I needed
which<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.750> say<00:04:03.780> I've<00:04:04.470> got<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.099> wrong<00:04:05.669> side

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
which is to say I've got the wrong side

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.869 
which is to say I've got the wrong side
facing<00:04:06.569> me<00:04:06.959> I've<00:04:07.590> got<00:04:07.889> this<00:04:08.370> little<00:04:08.579> nub

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
facing me I've got this little nub

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.970 
facing me I've got this little nub
that's<00:04:09.359> going<00:04:09.689> towards<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.079> tree<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.500> now

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
that's going towards the tree and now

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.619 
that's going towards the tree and now
what<00:04:11.129> I<00:04:11.159> need<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.400> do<00:04:11.609> is<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.909> reattach<00:04:12.299> the

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
what I need to do is to reattach the

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.909 
what I need to do is to reattach the
suspension<00:04:15.109> so<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.259> I've<00:04:16.349> got<00:04:16.530> my<00:04:16.650> soft

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
suspension so here I've got my soft

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.240 
suspension so here I've got my soft
shackle<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.489> rescue<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:19.070> now<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.099> have

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
shackle to the rescue and now I have

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.339 
shackle to the rescue and now I have
reattached<00:04:20.729> my<00:04:20.849> suspension<00:04:21.479> now<00:04:21.959> before<00:04:22.139> I

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
reattached my suspension now before I

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.770 
reattached my suspension now before I
put<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> pole<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.639> I've<00:04:24.150> created<00:04:24.389> a<00:04:24.539> problem

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
put the pole in I've created a problem

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.629 
put the pole in I've created a problem
for<00:04:24.930> myself<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.949> is<00:04:26.130> i<00:04:26.160> have<00:04:26.460> just

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
for myself and that is i have just

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.060 
for myself and that is i have just
lengthened<00:04:27.389> this<00:04:27.960> side<00:04:28.229> of<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.590> suspension

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
lengthened this side of the suspension

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.879 
lengthened this side of the suspension
triangle<00:04:29.610> by<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.570> much<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.320> i'm<00:04:31.650> going<00:04:31.830> to

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
triangle by this much and i'm going to

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.129 
triangle by this much and i'm going to
have<00:04:32.099> to<00:04:32.130> add<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.460> much<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.690> other<00:04:33.840> side

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
have to add that much to the other side

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.080 
have to add that much to the other side
because<00:04:34.949> i<00:04:34.979> don't<00:04:35.340> have<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> way<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.940> adjusting

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
because i don't have a way of adjusting

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.330 
because i don't have a way of adjusting
the<00:04:36.720> lengths<00:04:37.020> up<00:04:37.139> at<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.380> top<00:04:37.530> remember<00:04:38.280> at

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the lengths up at the top remember at

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.370 
the lengths up at the top remember at
the<00:04:38.430> top<00:04:38.639> one<00:04:39.360> side<00:04:39.599> is<00:04:39.780> buried<00:04:40.139> into<00:04:40.260> the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
the top one side is buried into the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.320 
the top one side is buried into the
other<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.070> have<00:04:41.250> an<00:04:41.340> extra<00:04:41.610> piece<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:42.210> I'm

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
other so I have an extra piece that I'm

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.330 
other so I have an extra piece that I'm
going<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.599> just<00:04:42.810> add<00:04:42.990> on<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:43.889> just<00:04:44.220> to

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
going to just add on to this just to

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.790 
going to just add on to this just to
cause<00:04:44.699> this<00:04:45.030> side<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.840> be<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.080> same<00:04:46.289> length<00:04:46.590> as

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
cause this side to be the same length as

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.560 
cause this side to be the same length as
this<00:04:47.190> side<00:04:47.430> so<00:04:50.690> we<00:04:51.690> know<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.990> drill<00:04:52.199> by<00:04:52.260> now

myself<00:07:08.610> I<00:07:09.000> find<00:07:09.270> that<00:07:09.389> the<00:07:09.509> lightweight<00:07:09.839> pole

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
myself I find that the lightweight pole

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.649 
myself I find that the lightweight pole
that<00:07:10.229> I<00:07:10.289> carry<00:07:10.650> down<00:07:11.250> there<00:07:11.550> I<00:07:11.580> can't<00:07:12.120> move<00:07:12.300> way

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
that I carry down there I can't move way

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.480 
that I carry down there I can't move way
more<00:07:12.930> than<00:07:12.990> an<00:07:13.169> ounce<00:07:13.259> or<00:07:13.469> two<00:07:13.650> and<00:07:13.860> so<00:07:14.339> that's

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
more than an ounce or two and so that's

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.369 
more than an ounce or two and so that's
worth<00:07:14.759> it<00:07:14.909> to<00:07:15.000> me<00:07:15.150> that<00:07:15.330> carried<00:07:15.719> along<00:07:15.930> so

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:16.379 
worth it to me that carried along so

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:17.719 
worth it to me that carried along so
overall<00:07:16.949> it's<00:07:17.159> a<00:07:17.219> fairly<00:07:17.430> lightweight

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
overall it's a fairly lightweight

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.640 
overall it's a fairly lightweight
package

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650
