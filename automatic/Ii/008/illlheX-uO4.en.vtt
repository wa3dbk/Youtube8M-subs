I'm<00:00:00.510> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.930> show<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.170> how<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> make<00:00:01.800> a

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.679 
I'm going to show you how to make a
simple<00:00:02.190> latex<00:00:02.490> prosthetic<00:00:02.730> but<00:00:03.270> first<00:00:03.510> we're

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
simple latex prosthetic but first we're

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.090 
simple latex prosthetic but first we're
going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.959> review<00:00:04.230> what<00:00:04.410> we<00:00:04.500> won't<00:00:04.680> be<00:00:04.920> doing

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
going to review what we won't be doing

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.860 
going to review what we won't be doing
the<00:00:05.460> classical<00:00:06.000> methods<00:00:06.299> they<00:00:06.450> show<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.660> in

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
the classical methods they show you in

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.450 
the classical methods they show you in
the<00:00:06.960> books<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.560> websites<00:00:08.010> where<00:00:08.370> you

the books and on the websites where you

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.730 
the books and on the websites where you
make<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> plaster<00:00:09.150> mold<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:09.630> face<00:00:09.840> pull

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
make a plaster mold of your face pull

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740 
make a plaster mold of your face pull
the<00:00:10.860> mold<00:00:11.070> off<00:00:11.280> fill<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.240> something<00:00:12.599> else

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the mold off fill it with something else

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.180 
the mold off fill it with something else
to<00:00:12.960> make<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> positive<00:00:13.380> mold<00:00:13.920> from<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
to make a positive mold from the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460 
to make a positive mold from the
negative<00:00:14.670> mold<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.599> pop<00:00:15.870> out<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.230> dry

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
negative mold then pop out that dry

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.439 
negative mold then pop out that dry
positive<00:00:16.980> mold<00:00:17.190> build<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> shape<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.390> your

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
positive mold build up the shape of your

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.390 
positive mold build up the shape of your
prosthetic<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.350> make<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> mold<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> that

latex appliance out of the mold and then

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.560 
latex appliance out of the mold and then
put<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.740> here's<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> be

put it on here's what we are going to be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.200 
put it on here's what we are going to be
doing<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.650> we'll<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.279> we're<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
doing what we'll do is we're going to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.420 
doing what we'll do is we're going to
build<00:00:33.450> our<00:00:33.600> shape<00:00:33.840> our<00:00:34.100> appliance<00:00:35.100> we're

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
build our shape our appliance we're

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.549 
build our shape our appliance we're
going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> coat<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.690> liquid<00:00:36.960> latex<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
going to coat it with liquid latex and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
going to coat it with liquid latex and
several<00:00:37.800> layers<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:39.270> we're<00:00:39.510> done<00:00:39.750> now

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
several layers and then we're done now

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
several layers and then we're done now
I'll<00:00:40.500> show<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.040> live<00:00:41.250> video<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I'll show you the live video of this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
I'll show you the live video of this
process<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:44.480> make<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.960> sculpture<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:46.680> going

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
process to make the sculpture I'm going

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.240 
process to make the sculpture I'm going
to<00:00:47.129> :<00:00:47.489> latex<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.239> using<00:00:48.629> pottery<00:00:49.140> clay<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.680> use

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to : latex I'm using pottery clay I use

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130 
to : latex I'm using pottery clay I use
pottery<00:00:50.640> clay<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.360> even<00:00:51.660> though<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> gets

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
pottery clay because even though it gets

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
pottery clay because even though it gets
hard<00:00:52.590> when<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.039> dries<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> air

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
hard when it dries in the air

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.760 
hard when it dries in the air
it<00:00:54.600> still<00:00:55.289> melts<00:00:55.680> away<00:00:57.350> when<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> dip<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it still melts away when you dip it in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.810 
it still melts away when you dip it in
water<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.510> just<00:01:00.510> becomes<00:01:00.899> goo<00:01:01.820> that's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
water and just becomes goo that's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
water and just becomes goo that's
important<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.619> coat

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
important because if I'm going to coat

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.810 
important because if I'm going to coat
this<00:01:05.519> clay<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.909> latex<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> latex<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.670> in

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this clay with latex the latex like in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
this clay with latex the latex like in
this<00:01:08.970> eye<00:01:09.630> socket<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.680> made<00:01:10.890> doesn't<00:01:11.729> melt<00:01:11.850> away

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this eye socket I made doesn't melt away

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
this eye socket I made doesn't melt away
it's<00:01:12.390> water-resistant<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.350> waterproof

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it's water-resistant it's waterproof

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's water-resistant it's waterproof
rubber<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> coat<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.500> clay<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.310> latex

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
rubber so if I coat the clay with latex

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.700 
rubber so if I coat the clay with latex
and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.270> dip<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.570> water<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.350> clay<00:01:19.530> will

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and then I dip it in water the clay will

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.469 
and then I dip it in water the clay will
just<00:01:19.860> melt<00:01:20.070> away<00:01:20.189> acting<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> release

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
just melt away acting as a release

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
just melt away acting as a release
separating<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.680> layers<00:01:22.890> apart<00:01:23.280> that's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
separating the two layers apart that's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 
separating the two layers apart that's
really<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:25.049> useful<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.070> going

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
really really useful and it's not going

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
really really useful and it's not going
to<00:01:26.400> happen<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> use<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.240> oil-based

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
to happen if you use an oil-based

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
to happen if you use an oil-based
modeling<00:01:28.320> clay<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.890> example<00:01:32.100> I'm

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
modeling clay so for this example I'm

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.270 
modeling clay so for this example I'm
making<00:01:33.000> an<00:01:33.060> 8<00:01:33.210> type<00:01:33.600> nose<00:01:33.990> upper<00:01:34.829> lip<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
making an 8 type nose upper lip and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670 
making an 8 type nose upper lip and
bridge<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.299> nose<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.110> did<00:01:37.259> last<00:01:37.439> year

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bridge of the nose like I did last year

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.039 
bridge of the nose like I did last year
just<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.579> example<00:01:38.880> I've<00:01:39.540> made<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> wide

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
just for the example I've made a wide

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.100 
just for the example I've made a wide
skirt<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> clay<00:01:41.159> around<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> sculpture<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
skirt of clay around the sculpture that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.190 
skirt of clay around the sculpture that
way<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.790> cut<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> shape<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.960> face

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
way I can just cut it to shape the face

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.910 
way I can just cut it to shape the face
of<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> wearer

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
of the wearer

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.980 
of the wearer
since<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.579> didn't<00:01:47.850> use<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> mold<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.720> make<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
since I didn't use a mold to make it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.520 
since I didn't use a mold to make it
accurate<00:01:49.729> I'm<00:01:50.960> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.079> painting<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
accurate I'm going to be painting a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.789 
accurate I'm going to be painting a
layer<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.860> latex<00:01:53.189> directly<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> clay<00:01:54.799> so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
layer of latex directly on the clay so

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.560 
layer of latex directly on the clay so
if<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.009> let<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> clay<00:01:56.460> dry<00:01:56.820> pretty<00:01:57.119> thoroughly

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
if I let the clay dry pretty thoroughly

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
if I let the clay dry pretty thoroughly
before<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.930> start<00:01:58.200> painting<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.590> latex<00:01:58.950> on

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
before I start painting the latex on

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.550 
before I start painting the latex on
then<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> will<00:02:00.210> absorb<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.930> moisture<00:02:01.079> from

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
then it will absorb the moisture from

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560 
then it will absorb the moisture from
the<00:02:01.680> latex<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> inside<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.270> latex

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
the latex on the inside and the latex
layers<00:02:03.899> will<00:02:04.170> dry<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.380> quickly<00:02:04.829> which

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
layers will dry really quickly which

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.089 
layers will dry really quickly which
makes<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> quicker<00:02:06.259> I've<00:02:07.259> got<00:02:07.469> water<00:02:07.710> here

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
makes it quicker I've got water here

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.010

layers<00:03:35.669> will<00:03:36.030> dry<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:37.379> fast<00:03:37.709> and

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
layers will dry really really fast and

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:51.809 
layers will dry really really fast and
the<00:03:38.340> thick<00:03:38.519> layers<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.849> take<00:03:39.239> forever

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.610 

I'm<00:03:52.329> not<00:03:52.569> going<00:03:52.719> to<00:03:52.780> do<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.140> whole<00:03:53.319> piece

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
I'm not going to do it the whole piece

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.500 
I'm not going to do it the whole piece
I'm<00:03:53.859> just<00:03:54.099> gonna<00:03:54.219> do<00:03:54.519> part<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.299> as<00:03:55.420> an

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
I'm just gonna do part of it as an

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.330 
I'm just gonna do part of it as an
example<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.079> then<00:03:56.769> I'll<00:03:56.889> show<00:03:57.069> you<00:03:57.159> some

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
example and then I'll show you some

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.280 
example and then I'll show you some
video<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.969> the<00:03:58.329> prosthetic<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.499> did<00:03:59.650> last<00:03:59.920> year

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
video of the prosthetic I did last year

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.559 
video of the prosthetic I did last year
so<00:04:02.290> as<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.829> gets<00:04:02.920> as<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.700> gets<00:04:03.849> dry<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.299> starts

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
so as it gets as it gets dry it starts

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.869 
so as it gets as it gets dry it starts
to<00:04:04.629> get<00:04:04.689> sticky<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.109> tacky<00:04:05.379> and<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:06.700> gets

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
to get sticky and tacky and it gets

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.890 
to get sticky and tacky and it gets
clear<00:04:07.209> in<00:04:08.200> order<00:04:09.159> to<00:04:09.400> give<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.579> color<00:04:09.900> after

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
clear in order to give it color after

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.339 
clear in order to give it color after
the<00:04:11.109> first<00:04:11.349> couple<00:04:11.530> layers<00:04:12.959> I'll<00:04:13.959> take<00:04:14.200> the

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
the first couple layers I'll take the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.140 
the first couple layers I'll take the
makeup<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.980> I'm<00:04:15.159> going<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.459> be<00:04:15.579> using<00:04:15.969> with

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
makeup that I'm going to be using with

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.089 
makeup that I'm going to be using with
the<00:04:16.269> final<00:04:16.570> costume<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.169> I'll<00:04:17.650> mix<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:18.009> in

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
the final costume and I'll mix it in

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:28.129 
the final costume and I'll mix it in
with<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.340> liquid<00:04:18.609> latex<00:04:23.250> just<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.460> little<00:04:24.759> bit

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.640 

mixed<00:04:29.139> in<00:04:29.289> is<00:04:30.630> enough<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.750> color<00:04:31.960> quite<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> bit

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
mixed in is enough to color quite a bit

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.040 
mixed in is enough to color quite a bit
of<00:04:32.740> latex<00:04:33.009> I'm<00:04:33.370> using<00:04:34.000> cream<00:04:34.330> base<00:04:34.509> makeup<00:04:34.780> by

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
the way I don't know if this would work

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:44.580 
the way I don't know if this would work
as<00:04:37.030> well<00:04:37.060> or<00:04:37.449> if<00:04:37.599> it<00:04:37.720> all<00:04:37.870> with<00:04:38.110> oil-based<00:04:43.590> now

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.100 
the latex are just mixed in looks kind
of<00:04:46.539> pastel<00:04:47.050> brown<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:48.400> when<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.610> let<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:48.910> dry<00:04:49.110> it

dries to a nice deep dark brown that
matches<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.870> makeup<00:04:56.460> okay<00:04:57.460> I'll<00:04:57.639> apply<00:04:57.909> the

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
then show you what happens when you peel

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.040 
then show you what happens when you peel
it<00:05:00.970> off<00:05:03.180> here's<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.300> close-up<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.870> me

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
it off here's the close-up of me

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.200 
it off here's the close-up of me
painting<00:05:05.349> on<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.680> latex<00:05:06.009> you<00:05:06.789> can<00:05:06.940> see<00:05:07.090> this

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
painting on the latex you can see this

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.110 
painting on the latex you can see this
layer<00:05:07.449> is<00:05:07.570> getting<00:05:07.720> pretty<00:05:07.930> dry<00:05:09.000> compared<00:05:10.000> the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
layer is getting pretty dry compared the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.570 
layer is getting pretty dry compared the
layer<00:05:10.300> that's<00:05:10.570> already<00:05:10.900> on<00:05:11.169> there<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:12.430> what

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
layer that's already on there to what

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:22.970 
layer that's already on there to what
I'm<00:05:12.699> adding<00:05:12.880> now

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.180 

here's<00:05:24.420> three<00:05:25.420> layers<00:05:25.660> of<00:05:25.810> plain<00:05:26.560> latex<00:05:27.010> and

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
here's three layers of plain latex and

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.270 
here's three layers of plain latex and
one<00:05:27.340> layer<00:05:27.550> of<00:05:27.640> coloured<00:05:28.030> latex<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:29.280> it

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
one layer of coloured latex and it

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.490 
one layer of coloured latex and it
screams<00:05:30.880> done<00:05:31.330> really<00:05:31.570> quickly<00:05:31.930> for<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.260> demo

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
screams done really quickly for a demo

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.880 
screams done really quickly for a demo
it's<00:05:32.830> horrible<00:05:33.490> but<00:05:33.670> you<00:05:33.730> get<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.090> idea<00:05:34.890> I'll

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
it's horrible but you get the idea I'll

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.820 
it's horrible but you get the idea I'll
peel<00:05:36.220> off<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:37.180> layer<00:05:37.810> now<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.380> you<00:05:38.470> can<00:05:38.650> see

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
peel off the layer now so you can see

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:47.760 
peel off the layer now so you can see
how<00:05:38.920> it<00:05:39.040> comes<00:05:39.220> off<00:05:46.050> it's<00:05:47.050> being<00:05:47.260> sticky<00:05:47.560> like

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
how it comes off it's being sticky like

00:05:47.770 --> 00:06:12.080 
how it comes off it's being sticky like
this<00:05:48.010> I<00:05:48.250> can<00:05:48.580> always<00:05:49.710> dip<00:05:50.710> it<00:05:50.830> in<00:05:50.920> water

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.060 

so<00:06:12.900> you<00:06:12.990> can<00:06:13.200> see<00:06:13.320> that<00:06:13.440> if<00:06:13.560> I<00:06:13.620> did<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.889> whole

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
so you can see that if I did the whole

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.740 
so you can see that if I did the whole
thing<00:06:14.100> it<00:06:14.550> would<00:06:14.639> have<00:06:14.760> more<00:06:14.910> shape<00:06:15.210> to<00:06:15.240> it<00:06:15.450> and

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
thing it would have more shape to it and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.540 
thing it would have more shape to it and
also<00:06:16.200> if<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.500> made<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.770> sculpture<00:06:17.010> a<00:06:17.250> little

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
also if I made the sculpture a little

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.690 
also if I made the sculpture a little
deeper<00:06:18.139> but<00:06:19.139> it's<00:06:19.380> a<00:06:19.440> good<00:06:19.620> demo<00:06:19.830> let<00:06:20.430> me<00:06:20.550> show

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
deeper but it's a good demo let me show

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.140 
deeper but it's a good demo let me show
you<00:06:20.760> now<00:06:20.880> what<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:22.650> whole<00:06:22.830> getup<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.610> did<00:06:23.940> last

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
year looked like using the nose the lip

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.080 
year looked like using the nose the lip
