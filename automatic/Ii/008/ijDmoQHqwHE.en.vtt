00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.830 
where you see the Fox running across the
desert<00:01:59.700> pretty<00:01:59.909> cool<00:02:00.090> I'm<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.540> excited

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
desert pretty cool I'm really excited

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.780 
desert pretty cool I'm really excited
about<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> animals<00:02:01.590> roaming<00:02:02.040> around<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.579> think

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
about the animals roaming around I think

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.709 
about the animals roaming around I think
there's<00:02:02.909> gonna<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> lot<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.360> because

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
there's gonna be a lot more because

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.359 
there's gonna be a lot more because
obviously<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.079> isn't<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.500> 20<00:02:04.860> new<00:02:05.040> species

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
obviously this isn't be 20 new species

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
obviously this isn't be 20 new species
so<00:02:06.000> that's<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.780> neat<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:08.099> we

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
so that's pretty neat and then here we

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.540 
so that's pretty neat and then here we
have<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> first<00:02:08.849> shot<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.840> new<00:02:10.140> dog<00:02:10.470> I've

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
have the first shot of this new dog I've

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
have the first shot of this new dog I've
a dog<00:02:11.790> person<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.420> don't<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.990> about

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
a dog person so I don't know much about

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
a dog person so I don't know much about
what<00:02:13.710> types<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.130> dogs<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.580> weights<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.000> I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
what types of dogs are weights but I

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.730 
what types of dogs are weights but I
think<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.600> lot<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.050> people<00:02:16.140> were<00:02:16.350> telling<00:02:16.560> me

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
think a lot of people were telling me

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.250 
think a lot of people were telling me
this<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> westie<00:02:17.780> potentially<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.930> don't

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
this is a westie potentially I don't

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.290 
this is a westie potentially I don't
know<00:02:19.320> either<00:02:19.500> way<00:02:19.770> it's<00:02:20.070> pretty<00:02:20.430> cool<00:02:20.700> one

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
know either way it's pretty cool one

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.030 
know either way it's pretty cool one
thing<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.690> hoping<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.320> doesn't<00:02:22.770> happen

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
thing I'm hoping that doesn't happen

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.860 
thing I'm hoping that doesn't happen
because<00:02:23.880> roxor<00:02:24.270> did<00:02:24.390> say<00:02:24.510> there's<00:02:24.690> gonna<00:02:24.780> be

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
because roxor did say there's gonna be

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
because roxor did say there's gonna be
20<00:02:25.200> new<00:02:25.320> animals<00:02:25.800> I'm<00:02:25.950> hoping<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.700> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
20 new animals I'm hoping that all of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
20 new animals I'm hoping that all of
them<00:02:27.120> are<00:02:27.360> gonna<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.720> dogs<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:28.380> I'm<00:02:28.500> hoping<00:02:28.800> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
them are gonna be dogs like I'm hoping a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
them are gonna be dogs like I'm hoping a
majority<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.760> em<00:02:29.850> are<00:02:30.000> actually<00:02:30.330> gonna<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.570> new

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
majority of em are actually gonna be new

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.990 
majority of em are actually gonna be new
animals<00:02:31.200> instead<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.980> maybe<00:02:32.160> ten<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.820> being

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
animals instead of maybe ten just being

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.510 
animals instead of maybe ten just being
new<00:02:33.270> kinds<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.050> dogs<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.920> obviously<00:02:35.100> we'll

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
new kinds of dogs but obviously we'll

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.680 
new kinds of dogs but obviously we'll
have<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.760> wait<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:35.910> see<00:02:36.060> here<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.660> have

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
have to wait and see here we have

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.480 
have to wait and see here we have
another<00:02:36.930> scene<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.830> sure<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
another scene and not sure if this is a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.640 
another scene and not sure if this is a
cutscene<00:02:38.940> or<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> isn't<00:02:40.320> then

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
another lady walking a dog and then we

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.760 
another lady walking a dog and then we
have<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.850> hobos<00:03:09.480> living<00:03:09.990> underneath<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
have the hobos living underneath the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.070 
have the hobos living underneath the
overpasses<00:03:11.610> right<00:03:12.060> here<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.510> not<00:03:12.810> sure<00:03:12.990> if

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
overpasses right here and not sure if

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.270 
overpasses right here and not sure if
they<00:03:13.200> were<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> last<00:03:13.650> gen<00:03:13.860> version<00:03:14.010> Lee<00:03:14.250> I

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
they were in the last gen version Lee I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
they were in the last gen version Lee I
think<00:03:14.430> they<00:03:14.730> might<00:03:14.970> have<00:03:15.000> been<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.270> there's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
think they might have been but there's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.510 
think they might have been but there's
some<00:03:16.020> rats<00:03:16.290> running<00:03:16.560> about<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.250> pretty<00:03:17.430> cool
