00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
going very rarely did I find myself in

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.249 
going very rarely did I find myself in
this<00:01:52.649> position<00:01:52.710> where<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:54.960> where<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
this position where I was like where the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
this position where I was like where the
hell<00:01:55.470> am<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.710> supposed<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:57.299> only

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
hell am I supposed to go the only
