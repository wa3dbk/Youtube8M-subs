00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:06.979 
otago has been taking a closer look

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.840 
otago has been taking a closer look
inside<00:00:07.339> the<00:00:07.549> pigeons<00:00:08.120> brains<00:00:08.480> and<00:00:09.850> he

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
inside the pigeons brains and he

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.360 
inside the pigeons brains and he
discovered<00:00:11.450> that<00:00:11.480> pigeons<00:00:12.200> along<00:00:13.040> with<00:00:13.220> our

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
discovered that pigeons along with our

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.090 
discovered that pigeons along with our
primate<00:00:13.790> cousins<00:00:14.380> canto<00:00:15.380> recognize<00:00:15.890> of

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
abstract objects are the same or

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.500 
abstract objects are the same or
different

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
different

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.240 
different
when<00:00:20.510> trained<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.110> recognize<00:00:21.289> abstract

when trained to recognize abstract

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.700 
when trained to recognize abstract
objects<00:00:22.869> like<00:00:23.869> these<00:00:24.110> green<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:24.590> blue

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
objects like these green and blue

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.120 
objects like these green and blue
circles<00:00:25.930> pigeons<00:00:26.930> not<00:00:27.170> only<00:00:27.530> know<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.740> match

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
circles pigeons not only know to match

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.279 
circles pigeons not only know to match
the<00:00:28.340> blue<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:28.820> blue<00:00:29.180> and<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.930> green<00:00:30.140> to

the blue to the blue and the green to

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.750 
the blue to the blue and the green to
the<00:00:30.410> green<00:00:32.409> but<00:00:33.409> they<00:00:33.559> can<00:00:33.739> also<00:00:33.980> transfer<00:00:34.609> the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
the green but they can also transfer the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.849 
the green but they can also transfer the
skill<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.239> objects<00:00:35.749> that<00:00:35.989> they've<00:00:36.350> never<00:00:36.530> seen

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
skill to objects that they've never seen

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:43.420 
skill to objects that they've never seen
before<00:00:37.510> like<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:38.809> hand

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.619 

in<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.700> bomb

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.420 

so<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.289> matching<00:00:48.440> task<00:00:48.769> is<00:00:48.949> interesting

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
so the matching task is interesting

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.560 
so the matching task is interesting
because<00:00:49.519> matching<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.149> something<00:00:50.359> that<00:00:50.480> we

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
because matching is something that we

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.060 
because matching is something that we
used<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.870> think<00:00:51.019> was<00:00:51.170> unique<00:00:51.469> deployments

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
used to think was unique deployments

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.069 
used to think was unique deployments
showing<00:00:52.550> that<00:00:52.640> pigeons<00:00:52.969> can<00:00:53.120> match<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:53.839> only

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
showing that pigeons can match but only

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.360 
showing that pigeons can match but only
shows<00:00:54.260> that<00:00:54.289> they<00:00:54.500> have<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.769> ability<00:00:54.859> to

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
shows that they have the ability to

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.130 
shows that they have the ability to
match<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:55.969> also<00:00:56.089> shows<00:00:56.449> they<00:00:56.659> can<00:00:56.809> apply<00:00:57.050> a

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
match but it also shows they can apply a

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.610 
match but it also shows they can apply a
learned<00:00:57.500> skill<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.579> novel<00:00:58.879> situation

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620

learned skill to a novel situation
doctor<00:01:00.620> scarf<00:01:00.949> has<00:01:01.309> discovered<00:01:01.670> that<00:01:01.879> pigeons

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
doctor scarf has discovered that pigeons

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.689 
doctor scarf has discovered that pigeons
can<00:01:02.659> plan<00:01:02.899> at<00:01:03.079> least<00:01:03.109> one<00:01:03.469> slipper<00:01:03.860> head<00:01:04.129> as

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
can plan at least one slipper head as

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.940 
can plan at least one slipper head as
well<00:01:04.970> as<00:01:05.030> primates<00:01:05.600> do<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.930> pigeon<00:01:09.229> has<00:01:09.649> been

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
well as primates do this pigeon has been

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.529 
well as primates do this pigeon has been
trained<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.310> pick<00:01:10.520> three<00:01:10.880> colors<00:01:11.299> in<00:01:11.479> a

he still picks them in the right order

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.359 
he still picks them in the right order
which<00:01:35.869> indicates<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.679> his<00:01:36.830> planned<00:01:37.190> his

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
which indicates that his planned his

which indicates that his planned his
actions<00:01:37.789> are<00:01:37.970> hid<00:01:39.940> but<00:01:40.940> as<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.270> turns<00:01:41.509> out<00:01:41.780> our

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
actions are hid but as it turns out our

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.529 
actions are hid but as it turns out our
clever<00:01:42.619> pigeons<00:01:43.130> can<00:01:43.369> recognize<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.090> miracle

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
clever pigeons can recognize the miracle

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.270 
clever pigeons can recognize the miracle
differences<00:01:45.140> as<00:01:45.289> well<00:01:47.920> pigeons<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.100> been

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
differences as well pigeons have been

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.190 
differences as well pigeons have been
trained<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:50.000> assort<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.630> first<00:01:50.899> three

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
trained to assort the first three

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.359 

everyone<00:01:56.509> surprised<00:01:57.020> however<00:01:57.350> they<00:01:58.039> can<00:01:58.219> also

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
everyone surprised however they can also

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.279 
everyone surprised however they can also
recognize<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.210> difference<00:01:59.570> between<00:01:59.659> large

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
recognize the difference between large

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.709 
recognize the difference between large
numbers<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.100> they've<00:02:01.250> never<00:02:01.369> seen<00:02:01.520> before

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.480 

so<00:02:06.200> what<00:02:06.320> surprised<00:02:06.680> being<00:02:06.920> me<00:02:07.130> about<00:02:07.369> my

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so what surprised being me about my

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.949 
so what surprised being me about my
research<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.270> basically<00:02:08.450> found<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
research is that I basically found the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.229 
research is that I basically found the
pigeons<00:02:09.289> could<00:02:09.470> perform<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:10.069> lot<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.700> tasks

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
pigeons could perform a lot of the tasks

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.979 
pigeons could perform a lot of the tasks
on<00:02:11.450> par<00:02:12.440> if<00:02:12.800> not<00:02:13.069> better<00:02:13.220> than<00:02:13.459> primates<00:02:14.150> so

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
on par if not better than primates so

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.059 
on par if not better than primates so
what<00:02:15.140> we're<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.380> do<00:02:15.500> now<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.920> we're

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
what we're going to do now is we're

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.290 
what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> go<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.459> task<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.880> we<00:02:17.090> know

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
going to go to a task that we know

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.150 
going to go to a task that we know
pigeons<00:02:17.810> perform<00:02:18.170> better<00:02:18.319> than<00:02:18.530> us<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.010> it's

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
pigeons perform better than us and it's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.009 
pigeons perform better than us and it's
the<00:02:19.310> navigation<00:02:19.880> skills<00:02:20.150> sober<00:02:20.330> dudes<00:02:20.870> can

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
the navigation skills sober dudes can

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.259 
the navigation skills sober dudes can
navigate<00:02:21.170> from<00:02:21.650> far<00:02:22.459> away<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.030> never

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
navigate from far away so they can never

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.180 
navigate from far away so they can never
get<00:02:23.420> over<00:02:23.450> hundreds<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.050> kilometres<00:02:24.590> from

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
get over hundreds of kilometres from

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.040 
get over hundreds of kilometres from
places<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.640> they've<00:02:25.849> never<00:02:25.970> been<00:02:26.120> before<00:02:26.300> so

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
places that they've never been before so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.330 
places that they've never been before so
now<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.230> new<00:02:27.440> research<00:02:27.769> is<00:02:27.890> going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.099> look<00:02:28.220> at

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
now the new research is going to look at

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.110 
now the new research is going to look at
how<00:02:28.430> they<00:02:28.610> do<00:02:28.670> that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
how they do that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.750 
how they do that
so<00:02:29.540> by<00:02:29.690> attaching<00:02:30.019> little<00:02:30.380> backpacks<00:02:30.830> that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
so by attaching little backpacks that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.630 
so by attaching little backpacks that
have<00:02:31.940> GPS<00:02:32.810> devices<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.440> them<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:34.489> can

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
have GPS devices in them we can

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370 
have GPS devices in them we can
basically<00:02:34.819> not<00:02:35.150> only<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:35.540> where<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:35.959> go

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
basically not only see where they go

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.519 
basically not only see where they go
but<00:02:36.590> also<00:02:36.739> how<00:02:36.980> they<00:02:37.099> get<00:02:37.280> there
