00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.840
 Baby women 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.840
 Arai 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.550
 Last year I'll review Atalimae of Zelda This is the new Zelda of transport 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.230
 I told everyone that it was a theme 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:34.629
 Well that's it before you talk about that actually to make it happen 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 In Zelda, there is another thing that I really wanted to do from the past and I realize it 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:42.110
 You are starting development from the beginning 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 It is ramen from the time of the legend of the first Zelda to say how it is up and down, left and right 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.660
 To scroll is to use the method, and from then on, the users are searching 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.780
 I think we have realized a vast field of 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 After that , it's going to be 3d high and so on 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.750
 How is the performance of the hardware? The vast world 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 It has become quite difficult to create 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:08.840
 For example, at the time of wind tact, you can explore the ocean 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:14.090
 Somehow using the various techniques say so Well, we have created a number of island the wide world 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.369
 I'm thinking of making it, but it's all completely in one big world 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 It was difficult to realize 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.270
 Cheese because it is in is surrounded by absolutely in the area 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.399
 Make such a place such an entrance and exit and arrange it one after another 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 It's like I'm playing in a wide world as a whole as a whole 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.260
 And Tsu going into the world beyond there because there is quite a boundary but I'm in the feeling 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 I could not do it 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:46.439
 Though I will try to talk you all For the most up-to-date's Zelda say cormorants today 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.439
 First of all, please see the game screen 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.770
 This is a new world of zero 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.430
 Let's really go 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.490
 Many worlds 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.890
 I think I was able to see something 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.810
 It is such a world that you can really reach if you do your best not to the mountains in the distance 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.640
 It has become 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.880
 Until now, I could not make that wide world so far 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.100
 If you say what you can do by using the world of hills 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.370
 I just said that 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.500
 There more and more more and more is that the border is no longer 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:28.180
 Is there in public to what say the wind because from where its their own Nde not go in there well into thumps 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:34.270
 From where you go and think about what you want to do 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.090
 The procedure is decided along the prepared way and say that we have to take care of the hospital 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.040
 Until now 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.950
 That's where you can break Zelda's Atarimae with it so far 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.430
 I think I can make a play that is not in Zelda 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.319
 This peaceful world you're looking at is this world 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.860
 If it is calm 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.840
 I Nde I thought Do's zero I So I say 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:59.980
 A strong enemy appears here 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:06.000
 It is zero that strong enemies appear in such Oda Kaya scene like this 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.000
 isf the one convention scan keep hard 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.370
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.220
 Hmm 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.790
 I heard
