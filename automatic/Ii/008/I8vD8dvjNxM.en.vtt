of<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.719> let's<00:00:49.020> go<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.469> your<00:00:49.500> notion<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
of all let's go back on your notion of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
of all let's go back on your notion of
languages<00:00:51.300> power<00:00:51.690> I'd<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.039> pretty

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
languages power I'd say that's pretty

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.369 
languages power I'd say that's pretty
reductive<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.110> going

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
reductive I think if you're just going

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.959 
reductive I think if you're just going
to<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> single<00:00:56.010> sentence<00:00:56.430> about<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to have a single sentence about what is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.000 
to have a single sentence about what is
power<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.600> say<00:00:57.899> money<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.500> power

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
power I would say money is power

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
power I would say money is power
and<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.460> talk<00:00:59.609> about<00:00:59.670> street<00:01:00.449> slang<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and if we talk about street slang it is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.529 
and if we talk about street slang it is
only<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> slang<00:01:02.489> somebody<00:01:03.390> like

kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> local<00:01:17.700> dialect<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.600> prevents

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
kind of local dialect actually prevents

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
kind of local dialect actually prevents
you<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.619> speaking<00:01:20.460> another<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:21.960> all

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you from speaking another we are all

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.160 
you from speaking another we are all
capable<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.979> being<00:01:23.189> by<00:01:23.549> dialectal<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
capable of being by dialectal that's to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
capable of being by dialectal that's to
say<00:01:25.320> speaking<00:01:25.770> two<00:01:26.340> kinds<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> language<00:01:27.420> or

say speaking two kinds of language or

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.980 
say speaking two kinds of language or
more<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> key<00:01:29.070> issue<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.460> why<00:01:29.909> don't<00:01:30.240> your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
more so the key issue is why don't your

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.270 
more so the key issue is why don't your
mates<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:32.490> Peckham<00:01:33.170> choose<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.979> speak

Standard<00:01:35.790> English<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:36.360> maybe<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
Standard English or maybe they can

and/or maybe they know how to and choose

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.710 
and/or maybe they know how to and choose
not<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> key<00:01:42.570> issues

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
not to so that's one of the key issues

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.069 
not to so that's one of the key issues
if<00:01:43.140> street<00:01:43.710> slang<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.210> lingua<00:01:45.390> franca<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
advocate it to the young people that I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.080 
advocate it to the young people that I
mentor<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:51.990> Peckham<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
mentor in Peckham but it's not so I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
mentor in Peckham but it's not so I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
code-switching or cultural relativism

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
code-switching or cultural relativism
because<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.520> actually<00:01:59.700> under

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
because I think that actually under

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.789 
because I think that actually under
pressure<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:01.020> example<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
pressure for example in that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
pressure for example in that
all-important<00:02:02.490> college<00:02:02.880> job<00:02:03.270> or<00:02:03.420> university

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
all-important college job or university

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.560 
all-important college job or university
interview<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.860> young<00:02:05.070> people<00:02:05.430> revert<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
interview the young people revert to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.930 
interview the young people revert to
type<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.770> revert<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> street<00:02:08.489> slang<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
type so they revert to street slang and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
type so they revert to street slang and
therefore<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.660> produces<00:02:09.750> their<00:02:10.560> application

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
therefore it produces their application

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.030 
therefore it produces their application
ok<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:11.910> let's<00:02:12.599> say<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.110> agree<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.709> idea
