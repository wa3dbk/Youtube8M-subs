00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 but woe to those who touch it 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.770
 and then let's have a good afternoon 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.340
 welcome back stefania bove archeologist 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.009
 expert in historical geography be 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.900
 previous beautiful is beautiful and large 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.880
 francesco and then today's question 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.189
 you just heard him say god to me 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 He has given woe to anyone who touches me to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.420
 you have two answer options number 1 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.050
 cristoforo colombo and the number option 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
 two 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.820
 napoleone 894003 you have 90 seconds a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.260
 your disposal 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.000
 hurry up because you have the chance 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.190
 to win the television in hd via with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 time then we don't give the answer 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 it was however we talk about many in November 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.600
 many years ago what happens in this way 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 important more or less 2 aces 200 years ago 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 where 124 years ago on November 30 Today 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 and 29 for I do n't know but we also remember it 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.170
 if tomorrow 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.770
 it was preparation 29 perhaps also 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 a few months before DL 29 it is there 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.329
 was the legal abolition of torture 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 of the death penalty by the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.570
 grand duchy of Tuscany 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.339
 this is an important fact because it is a 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.659
 first in primacy for Europe and for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.310
 italy in the sense that it was the first 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.430
 been in the world to have abolished the penalty 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 of death and those years in those years 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.950
 there had obviously been circulated 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.110
 ideas of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.690
 of cesare beccaria sud and of the rights 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 of the pine cones I am a man can 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.990
 let's say to have someone else's life 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.510
 man and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.010
 we say proposals and just for the per 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840
 reads the abolition of this penalty 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.910
 death was reintroduced may in reality 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.380
 in fact we have to say that the penalty is 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.880
 death had been cleaned by another state 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 that the republic of san marino always 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.060
 a record for Italy at the end of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.240
 but four hundred was an abolition 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.940
 in fact then legal and must be traced back to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.430
 1,800 was of death even then torture e 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.260
 two networks in the motivations also synthesis 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.700
 but the last country in Europe 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.230
 to abolish the death penalty but us 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 we are well state and france in 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.020
 1981 so we are talking about right of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.880
 a few years ago and just before nel 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.230
 sixties and the rest of the united kingdom e 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.090
 Italy instead of Italy 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.479
 interesting because Italy was 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.160
 abolished first in 1889 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.260
 but when only for the ddc of then 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.670
 only for some crimes 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.590
 especially shods then it will come 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.230
 reintroduced is definitively abolished 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.740
 in 48 the last execution was made 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.660
 in 47 but is kept in the code 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.570
 Criminal and this then has been abolished 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.310
 however in the final there was a penalty 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.150
 sorry excuse me in the code 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.300
 military history let's say maintained e 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.670
 then abolished in 1993 is definitely 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.530
 removed from the 2007 constitution therefore 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.590
 since 2007 it is impossible not possible 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.910
 put back less badly I feel bad then 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.709
 let's see cristoforo colombo 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.570
 napoleone napoleone napoleone buonaparte 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.390
 exact on what occasion it says e 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.680
 when he was crowned king when he came 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.190
 crowned king of italy 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.170
 precisely on 26 May 1805 26 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.690
 May many date is very good then 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 see 88 percent responded so 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.440
 correct napoleone and only 12 per 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 one hundred was wrong 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.600
 but what was meant by this? 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.790
 meant to say now and date and this is 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.290
 this gesture is essential for Napoleon 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.140
 because we say so much six months before 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.570
 he had already been crowned emperor 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.040
 in france and then after six months he decided 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.790
 obviously to become king too 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.860
 of Italy 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 means that he practically 26 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.040
 May he arrived in Milan it was 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.689
 crowned in the cathedral of Milan 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.120
 obviously accompanied by Josephine 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:30.430
 was still in his consort and in the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.469
 presence of 16 bishops and not of the pope 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.349
 with whom he had absolutely no good 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:37.750
 reports and took this crown crown 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.359
 very significant maybe we'll talk 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.159
 we will say something and put it alone on the 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.439
 chief therefore was no one 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.939
 to put her on the course obviously saying 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.709
 let's say this sentence god gave it to me 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.329
 woe to those who still take it from me 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.189
 now let's talk about the crown 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.680
 iron that because so important here 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.389
 the iron crown and a meanwhile exist 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.239
 still maybe not everyone knows it but yes 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.340
 located in is located in monza in the treasure 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.709
 practically of the cathedral of monza and is one 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.389
 very important crown for history 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.950
 of Italy because practically with this 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.269
 crown that dates back to the fifth century after 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.370
 christ in reality between the fifth and 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.409
 the eighth is the eighth century are you 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.939
 practically ire Lombard but also 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.040
 all the king of the holy Roman empire is 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.630
 the last one was actually Napoleon 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.699
 because the Savoys have always used 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.169
 instead the crown of Sardinia 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.240
 now this crown we are seeing in 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.760
 this photo is actually 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.590
 let's say a historical significance too 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.690
 it goes beyond its sense of crown 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.110
 because it is a relic that is according to the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.030
 legend inside that iron that then 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.919
 yes, that is what you see inside 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.409
 probably according to the legend it derives 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.519
 from one of the dl of the nails that 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.159
 elena the mother of Constantine 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.879
 of the Roman emperor he had brought from 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.119
 Jerusalem 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.369
 she brought three nails in Italy 2 with two 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:53.580
 of these the bite of the was made 

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:54.989
 horse of Constantine and then the helmet of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.789
 Constantine this meant the 

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:57.929
 Constantine protection obviously in 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.589
 this was instead use i 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.989
 collaborators 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:02.699
 no no the third then we say finish 

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:04.589
 another in another situation anyway 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.019
 they were only two to be used 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:09.029
 and then in the history of these nails to a 

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:11.789
 certain point one of these bandra 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:13.739
 preserved in the cathedral of Milan and again 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.229
 today they are a cappella with the bite 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:21.349
 of Constantine is instead another end in 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:23.849
 diadem of the helmet of santini then 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.099
 theodosius and then also all neat 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.919
 so the Lombards asked that it come 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.779
 returned this asks but is teodolinda 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.519
 decided to make this crown 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.169
 putting inside practically the 

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.909
 nail but I am doing now however 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.649
 indeed analyzes were made a 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.689
 account is the legend then an account is who 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:41.339
 he studied this crown the crown is 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.319
 It was studied a few years ago and it is 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:44.249
 seen so far that it is smaller than 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.029
 what had to be originally 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.139
 because only 15 centimeters then 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:52.529
 impossible because he wears it 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.360
 because in 1300 it was given as a pledge e 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.490
 returned missing some of the 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.050
 plaques and then it was seen that the iron 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.089
 which is inside is actually one 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.499
 silver alloy is not iron e 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.699
 probably came right in 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.110
 that opportunity to hold together 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.029
 these plaques therefore those who know they must 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.759
 finish was injured but there is another 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:11.369
 tradition instead says that these the 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.679
 nail iron must have been 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:16.499
 relays that the crown had underneath 

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:18.029
 because it was the system to be able to do it 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.499
 put on the arrival of Constantine 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.239
 for now you also know they are gone 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.709
 that no we no longer have and we have 

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:24.839
 find out where they are, however, what they are 

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:26.610
 matters is the meaning and value means 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.749
 wear a column with the nail 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.399
 of the cross has a very meaning 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.009
 important and we thank you again 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:34.829
 stefania bove thanks for letting us resort 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.519
 these well events that we will have to do more 

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:39.329
 often 

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:41.579
 and then we hear the phone ready in 

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:44.849
 ready for an afternoon with whom we speak 

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:47.269
 the bonate real with maria pecoraro maria 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:51.839
 good afternoon where you call 

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:53.849
 massimiliano with much emotion and it is 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:56.459
 sure to understand well that television 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.789
 saw there is someone here but also talk 

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.789
 with you 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.369
 no no no thanks then where does he call us 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:08.039
 mikami said silvano from the hole 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:11.189
 ragusa eboli where there is caciocavallo di 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:14.039
 ragusa punishes the ingot as it does not 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:16.369
 I know very well then we salute the 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.369
 our
