read the text of course inversely you

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.690 
read the text of course inversely you
can<00:00:40.540> also<00:00:40.780> reduce<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.890> font<00:00:42.160> size<00:00:42.370> as<00:00:42.579> well

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
can also reduce that font size as well

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.340
