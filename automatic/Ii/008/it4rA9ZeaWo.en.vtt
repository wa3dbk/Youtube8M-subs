00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.960
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.959
 This theme is 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:08.599
 Here's a little bit of back serve 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.389
 How to put out a back serve on how to put out 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.320
 This time I would like to do 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 The amount of rotation is not so much honest 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.189
 Although the amount of rotation is not large, the quality of rotation of serve is 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.349
 It works soberly in the game because it is very difficult to understand 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:57.730
 I'm a serve 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.690
 I want you to think for a moment 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.760
 What is a really out of service? 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.729
 Certainly I hate it, but I understand the rotation 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.250
 It is still easy to take even if the amount of rotation is smaller than that 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.840
 If you do not understand the pressure 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.179
 For example, up serve 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.329
 It is not such a strong up serve 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.219
 I will get stuck if I do not know the rotation 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.829
 If you get stuck, it will float large 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.520
 Of course strong rotation amount is good though 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.170
 First of all, I do not know 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.579
 If it is easy to use it in the game if you are conscious 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.369
 I think so please try to reference 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.499
 Then I want to explain how to put out this time 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.319
 How to put out this time is back swing first 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.979
 How to pull backswing 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.920
 Along this end line 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.969
 It feels like pulling a racket along the end line 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.020
 Pull backswing 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.709
 Please pull like this When you cut a serve 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.649
 To use the hip rotation or swing the racket large 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.420
 In this way, pulling the back swing towards the back 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.390
 There are so many, but with regard to this serve 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.540
 Just pull backswing along this end line 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.390
 Big swing back up to there 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.600
 Do not take it Please try this 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.510
 Next is the second point The second point is 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.310
 At the moment of hitting the secret of impact 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.400
 It is how to put out the impact Here is the bottom rotation and the top rotation 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.710
 Because it becomes Kimo to use properly 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.570
 Please listen carefully to the moment of impact 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 I feel like I dropped a racket with a weight 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.060
 Please try this image for a moment 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.350
 It feels like I'm holding it down 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.130
 Drop image Use this drop weight 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.090
 When it shakes and hangs here with Kyun 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.900
 It feels like it's a swing like this 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 I feel like I'll drop it at the moment it's pulled and hit 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.300
 Please put a force in the feeling of dropping and turn off the lower rotation 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.700
 When I put the upper rotation, I got the same 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.390
 I use the feeling of dropping using weight 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.320
 It's the moment you hit it, just like you pull a little on the elbow 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.790
 Please only elbow at the moment you hit 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.220
 Please pull and do so 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.230
 Because the power to shake up a little is added 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.070
 A little loose on the rotation by pulling the elbow 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.830
 I will come into the rotation of the serve and drop it as it is 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.440
 In this is the lower rotation as an image 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.700
 Just drop it just drop it 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970
 It feels like putting power 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.030
 This pulls the elbow a little at the moment the lower rotation takes 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.820
 It becomes an up serve by pulling the elbow a little 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.200
 This is the time to get a little sense 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.540
 Do it a lot because it may hang 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.200
 try it 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.479
 Next is the third point The third point is 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.870
 How to use follow through Follow through 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.919
 Please pull straight on the elbow while doing 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.830
 It's only this is so small 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.830
 I will follow through, even when rotating down 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.870
 In the form of dropping and pulling only the elbow 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.330
 It's very similar to the time you put up serve 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.719
 It's going to be a move When it's up serve 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.550
 In the case of the downward rotation to pull the elbow at the moment it hits 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.729
 In that it pulls the elbow after hitting 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.449
 It's a very small movement but almost the same 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.900
 Looks like the move back serve 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.960
 When I cut it hard, I pulled my wrist 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.300
 I will shake off but I can't get that kind of movement 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.419
 Great backswing, small follow-through small 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.419
 But from the appearance of the swing 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.759
 Because it is a form that rotation is hard to understand 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.000
 It's an easy-to-worry serve 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.879
 This serve is amazingly compact 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.659
 It's a move but it's great in the game 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.559
 As it is easy to use and swing is not big 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:38.419
 It is easy to control and difficult to read by the other party 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.120
 Even if read, control is quite 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.159
 It's easy to serve, so it's easy to hit it with one shot 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.979
 Has the advantage that an accident is unlikely to occur 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.439
 Thank you for trying it, thank you
