this part here I can't find one that's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.130 
this part here I can't find one that's
strong<00:01:38.939> enough<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> weight

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
strong enough for the kind of weight

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.340 
strong enough for the kind of weight
that<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> want<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.750> exactly<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that I want on it and it's not exactly a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
that I want on it and it's not exactly a
good<00:01:43.799> pro<00:01:44.070> solution<00:01:44.610> like<00:01:44.759> having<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.180> that's

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
good pro solution like having one that's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.249 
good pro solution like having one that's
already<00:01:45.509> prefabbed<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:47.040> 41<00:01:47.460> 37<00:01:47.880> s<00:01:48.000> AP<00:01:48.390> has<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
already prefabbed but 41 37 s AP has a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.520 
already prefabbed but 41 37 s AP has a
center<00:01:49.770> mount<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.520> detachable<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.229> if

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
center mount that is detachable so if

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.780 
center mount that is detachable so if
you<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.369> easier<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you want some that are easier to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
you want some that are easier to
transport<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.750> certainly<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
transport you can certainly do that and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.179 
transport you can certainly do that and
it<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.460> nice<00:01:57.180> thick<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> heavy<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.920> your

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it is nice thick and heavy so your

so we're basically enough pipe and drape

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.789 
so we're basically enough pipe and drape
all<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.420> way<00:03:18.480> around<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.200> these<00:03:19.470> between

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
all the way around have these between

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.220 
all the way around have these between

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
gonna do either the pro zip cover so the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.280 
gonna do either the pro zip cover so the
TCL<00:03:25.080> m18<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:27.269> way<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.630> have<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.870> really

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
light show there but even if you need to

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520

like<00:05:19.800> this<00:05:20.099> or<00:05:20.490> with<00:05:20.699> a<00:05:20.789> pro<00:05:20.970> zip<00:05:21.240> cover<00:05:21.419> I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
like this or with a pro zip cover I

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.450 
like this or with a pro zip cover I
didn't<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.080> run<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.289> cables<00:05:22.680> down<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:23.220> don't

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
didn't just run the cables down I don't

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.770 
didn't just run the cables down I don't
do<00:05:23.550> water<00:05:23.699> if<00:05:23.849> I<00:05:23.910> sitting<00:05:24.120> there<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.330> cleaning

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
do water if I sitting there and cleaning

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.999 
do water if I sitting there and cleaning
out<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.960> cables<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.410> make<00:05:25.530> him<00:05:25.650> look<00:05:25.740> pretty

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
out the cables and make him look pretty

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.950 
out the cables and make him look pretty
because<00:05:26.370> all<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.849> one<00:05:27.330> cable<00:05:27.539> goes<00:05:27.780> down

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
because all the one cable goes down

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.450 
because all the one cable goes down
there<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.289> then<00:05:28.590> I'm<00:05:28.680> just<00:05:28.800> gonna<00:05:28.919> use<00:05:29.220> like<00:05:29.430> a

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
there and then I'm just gonna use like a

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.250 
there and then I'm just gonna use like a
white<00:05:29.729> fly<00:05:29.940> transceiver<00:05:30.660> battery<00:05:31.050> power

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
white fly transceiver battery power

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.890
