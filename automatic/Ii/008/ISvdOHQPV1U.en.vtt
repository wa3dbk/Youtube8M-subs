00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.870
 of youtube comes out to give again the 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.140
 friends of strikeouts 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.050
 I will present you with a tutorial on how to 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.380
 change your league of legends to the language 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.270
 Latin American as they see it, he says 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.150
 that the soul of the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.189
 Latin American north and then we can 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.100
 request to use the voices for the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.160
 server that we have either the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.079
 North American l ouest or anyone 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.270
 good what they have to do to be able 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.570
 use its features is aa must go without 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.739
 region or change region and then 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.820
 you select latin america north alpha 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.410
 we call new in save and it 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.120
 download a package where you will sell 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.600
 all the voices that we are going to change 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.850
 and then once you download this 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.409
 update we close the client 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.719
 and we're going to good team here 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.850
 I do not know what to return to another region 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.159
 So if they come back I'll give them 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.590
 the folder that they just existed from 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.490
 install let's go where we have 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.970
 installed our league of legends 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.110
 my case is to place in ratings league of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 legends in the rats folder we are going to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 projects and we are going to enter this folder 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.729
 which is to change it so that we 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 appear in selection of selector 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.300
 of champions does not come out in Latin Spanish 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.900
 we double click 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.280
 and we enter here a folder of laws 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.530
 we enter the second to the penultimate 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.299
 peron folder 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:53.250
 and so doing and from here we look for the 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.250
 sound folder are 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.070
 here is already the folder of what is 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.550
 in Mexico x 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.550
 here is the choice 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.479
 and all we have to do is 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.479
 copy this in the archives 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.680
 ages copy of the files we're going to 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.290
 folder it's what I recommend 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.490
 that you make a backup of the voices 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.490
 bad stick 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.140
 we are the archives 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:41.670
 and it's already backed 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.670
 and my wing 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.950
 well this and here I have it here are the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.100
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 because that is to be able to enter faster 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.630
 against the folders and I'm going to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.480
 wrong 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.640
 and so that the first one works 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.879
 Now we have to go back to this 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.879
 draft 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.060
 mx 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:12.250
 well let's go to the folder of man ag 10 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.130
 hits 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.180
 you are here work from folder of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.160
 sounds 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.160
 efe mod and we copy the second file 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.450
 copy 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.849
 we go back here 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.800
 this window the only thing we have to do 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:36.349
 is to enter the client of hey jude es 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.379
 same as in the other in the folder 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.459
 manager fields here we enter the 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:47.150
 penultimate folder in data sounds 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.040
 sick and here where are we going to stick here 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.300
 asked have I back in original already 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.300
 I had backed him but we're going to erase 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.400
 and we're going to hit here or it's like 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.590
 make original 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.329
 is the only thing we have to do is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.950
 change it's name for example you 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:12.230
 we can put back voices 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.800
 and what we have to do is that this 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.190
 says mx to recognize it we have it 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.190
 what to change 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.759
 and it is already 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.500
 and that would be it and because all that 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.240
 we have to do is leave this what 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:39.460
 it's the folder that comes first from him 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:42.090
 he is pressured by plans 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.810
 and with create paste 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.150
 we copy the dsm x we ​​paste it in this and 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.100
 all this so that they do not make mistakes anymore 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.139
 that we can close this next to 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.500
 our league of legends we change the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.500
 region 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.750
 this version opens in america 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.750
 north implement save 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.750
 play 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.850
 we could not do this so they can see from 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.389
 what am I lying and nobody has a 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.289
 complaint after it was true we will 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.289
 create a quick game 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.480
 to the battle 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:34.250
 I will make them suffer always say I thought 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.350
 that my never would a new moon 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.240
 looks out welcome to the driver we are going to 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.950
 start so you can see that inside 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.950
 of these voices 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.550
 we go 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.359
 You have to do as 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.559
 they listen to the voices within the game more 

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:22.559
 Let's see we have left 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.980
 here we see that it is already 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.969
 are the data of the patch against a 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.429
 sandbox 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:38.439
 and we're going to overcome the good 32 voices like 

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:41.649
 we all know some are dragon ball 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:50.560
 z later simpson and we can already 

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:53.220
 enjoy it from before this 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:58.800
 those 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:02.940
 raven does everything with style 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.470
 they are judging how you can see then 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.470
 there are the voices of the players 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.139
 do not 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.889
 and also from the sea 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:20.720
 how can you see in English 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.850
 and that would be all in case they want 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.530
 Maybe later we will deliver 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.940
 events of what would be the icap of jets 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:45.150
 to subscribe and to be 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:47.550
 more attentive to the service of pain and therefore 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:51.020
 that would be all for destroying us can 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.020
 give you likes weyler
