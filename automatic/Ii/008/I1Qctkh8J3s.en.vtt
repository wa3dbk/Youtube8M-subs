00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.120
 nice that you are back 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.669
 us walkers at low and that is the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.009
 one of the middle posse from the new one 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.740
 high nobility and show you now 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.279
 the core mechanics since then 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 so-called key for the entire fight 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.090
 in connection to the fight itself but 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 now have one of these companies 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.449
 we throw then it is easy now 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.869
 give it to you at some point 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.060
 make an exact with this flamethrower 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.620
 should be practically the green should this 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.059
 green area is always 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 spread during the fight on the ground 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.410
 burn it down and use it back 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 that's it very important the whole thing was 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 she remembered worked back then 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.289
 advised to issue fire namely sport 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 that you have one if anywhere so here 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.699
 left and we already see a little bit 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.320
 the lived we always spread out 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.969
 then have to be relatively fast 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.760
 otherwise it could not do it anymore 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.070
 prevent spread and additionally 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
 would have to pay attention that yours 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.450
 Flamethrower can also overheat so 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 the longer here this set one rent 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.950
 the higher the bar and there must 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.710
 we enable to go back again and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.360
 so that he will waste himself and you again 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.310
 cools down so that's her now 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 difficulty of this person so too 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.460
 act 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.049
 that we experienced associations is needed 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.970
 is ready that he is not overloaded 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.520
 I have a hot runner in the men 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.650
 certain time until the driveways is that 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.710
 I have nothing you can do in this 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.630
 time to the green areas then zones 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.369
 you just stay there because they exist 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.750
 of course very much harm like what 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.750
 has in this area round 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.820
 what else is very important is there 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.799
 several flames are for that 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.990
 halbaffen dispensers behind the post 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.909
 have always been able to fully understand there 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.380
 Two players can use it practically 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.810
 we have to serve ourselves and then 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.890
 Sharing space is very important 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.119
 Here are two classes in the sense with it 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.470
 also do a bit of harm 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.700
 and I completely out of the fight 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.850
 be taken out 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.920
 the next one is on it now 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.989
 a standardized poland traffic 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.810
 free again to the principal expires that 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.070
 he the post determine during which at 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.420
 while first we will hurt 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.370
 what's up front over and over again? 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.590
 different kinds of mushrooms it 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.300
 once he becomes a living he will 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.130
 heals you the very important we 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.660
 must reverberate the full if the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.850
 love always had 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.769
 not disappear the country's image stars 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.370
 if you are in his reach 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.019
 make and thereby make it very important 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.030
 it is the end to bring him but green 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.950
 to put you in place then stop 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.310
 Of course, in the highest there was 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.680
 hardly pulsates for harm and the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.690
 Castings The lenders need the eso 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.329
 sell switchen and impick the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.160
 were the only do these 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.440
 that always sees her 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.340
 You have to get in as fast as possible 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.010
 focus 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.019
 because they always send these spurs 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.390
 which then fly to you and go away 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.160
 various is taken with gamblers 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.160
 and cause image damage 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.550
 For example, beer could be right now 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.620
 in ten years, such a green ever 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.720
 that's a bridge blitzer says 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.060
 uphold healer respond quickly 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.970
 and of course all in the rehabilitated 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.250
 Walter Boss 100 Energie has the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.380
 passing euro hurt that survived 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.090
 he only when he stands next to peak in the 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.160
 background are after our howl of 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.170
 I hire a devastating weed 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.670
 So that's the one burning the way 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.280
 Little exercise is feasible in general 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.540
 is just a great time there 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.160
 Remember that whole thing 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.720
 currently apparently they can still one 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.460
 little change specifically we had 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.950
 already seen here during the test 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.810
 that something has been modified 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.550
 I'll teach you the same right away 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.560
 on the incoming that we pan then 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.030
 from video forth again over we show 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.910
 you guys how that works with the app 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.010
 but has all new info as well as in too 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.110
 the instructions are what we can do 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.510
 you can find it as always in the link so in the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.340
 video description directly down for that 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.770
 with a click then practically everything up 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.150
 I present the silver tray 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.220
 now just here in the background 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.820
 we are already the smaller something 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.290
 it has to be incensed immediately on our music 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.420
 high and getting stronger and stronger 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.859
 then develop yourselves altogether 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.340
 only so I hope the video has you 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.440
 like 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.240
 thumb up if to and if 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.980
 not then it stays in the comments 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.070
 why not fell then and until 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.070
 next
