with that picture nothing so that's
that's<00:00:51.720> what<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> future<00:00:52.980> could<00:00:53.340> hold<00:00:53.400> for<00:00:54.090> us

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that's what the future could hold for us

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
that's what the future could hold for us
if<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:55.170> decided<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> good<00:00:56.610> idea

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
if we decided that this was a good idea

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.950 
if we decided that this was a good idea
that<00:00:57.660> needs<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.080> be<00:00:58.200> at<00:00:58.380> least<00:00:58.410> tried<00:00:59.960> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that needs to be at least tried this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.570 
that needs to be at least tried this

that's<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.770> nothing<00:01:23.180> that's<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that's your much for nothing that's just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
that's your much for nothing that's just
in<00:01:24.570> case<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:24.960> needed<00:01:25.310> well<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> raised<00:01:26.790> my

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
in case they needed well I raised my

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
in case they needed well I raised my
hand<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.390> nobody<00:01:27.720> saw<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.010> cuz<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
hand but nobody saw it you know cuz I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
hand but nobody saw it you know cuz I
could<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.790> used<00:01:29.940> 1<00:01:30.210> billion<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.810> how's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
could have used 1 billion of that how's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.500 
could have used 1 billion of that how's
that<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.580> had<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.760> billion<00:01:33.120> dollars

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
that because if I had a billion dollars

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.219 
that because if I had a billion dollars
or<00:01:33.840> even<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.530> half<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.920> billion<00:01:35.550> dollars<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.300> could

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
or even a half a billion dollars I could

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.260 
or even a half a billion dollars I could
I<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:38.130> well<00:01:38.720> actually<00:01:39.720> might<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.270> so

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I can well actually might have that so

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
I can well actually might have that so
I'm<00:01:42.360> sort<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.200> pre-empting<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.070> next<00:01:44.490> or

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
I'm sort of pre-empting with my next or

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
I'm sort of pre-empting with my next or
your<00:01:45.180> next<00:01:45.450> question<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:46.080> me<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.650> who

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
your next question to me and that is who

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.590 
your next question to me and that is who
could<00:01:47.490> afford<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:48.000> things<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.479> they're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
could afford these things if they're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840 
could afford these things if they're
going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.900> so<00:01:49.020> expensive<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.650> but<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
going to be so expensive right but the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.430 
going to be so expensive right but the
fact<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.750> first<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.260> anything

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
fact is that the first one of anything

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.460 
fact is that the first one of anything
is<00:01:52.620> expensive<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.450> first<00:01:54.720> ten<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> anything

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is expensive the first ten of anything

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
is expensive the first ten of anything
is<00:01:55.590> expensive<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> first<00:01:56.729> maybe<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
is expensive but the first maybe the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
is expensive but the first maybe the
hundreds<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.710> starts<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.610> reasonably

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
hundreds one starts to be reasonably

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510 
hundreds one starts to be reasonably
priced<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:02.010> know<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.159> could<00:02:02.369> take

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
priced and then you know I could take

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
priced and then you know I could take
out<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.790> cell<00:02:02.970> phone<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.330> off<00:02:03.510> by<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.900> so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
out my cell phone it's off by the way so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.620 
out my cell phone it's off by the way so

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
things like this but they don't even

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.589 
things like this but they don't even
want<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.430> do<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.700> anymore<00:04:02.940> what<00:04:03.329> they<00:04:03.480> would

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
want to do that anymore what they would

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.360 
want to do that anymore what they would
love<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> do<00:04:04.049> is<00:04:04.200> be<00:04:04.380> self-sufficient<00:04:04.829> so<00:04:05.250> they

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
love to do is be self-sufficient so they

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.640 
love to do is be self-sufficient so they
can<00:04:05.489> sell<00:04:05.669> everything<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.299> make<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> huge

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
can sell everything and make a huge

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.259 
can sell everything and make a huge
profit<00:04:07.829> rather<00:04:08.190> than<00:04:08.430> having<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.730> spend<00:04:09.060> some

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
profit rather than having to spend some

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.539 
profit rather than having to spend some
of<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.419> on<00:04:09.569> themselves<00:04:10.139> so<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.680> think<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
of that on themselves so I think the

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.780 
of that on themselves so I think the
logic<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.419> inescapable<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.579> is

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
logic of this is inescapable and that is

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.640 
logic of this is inescapable and that is
that<00:04:15.200> we<00:04:16.200> must<00:04:16.530> learn<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:18.150> feed<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.380> city

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that we must learn to feed the city

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.269 
that we must learn to feed the city
people<00:04:19.979> with<00:04:20.400> City<00:04:20.669> grown<00:04:20.970> food
