00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.850
 I write day and night can not 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.770
 Know if it makes it all up 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 The cooking is almost always until the morning 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.710
 awake I think of the good time of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 which remains almost nothing left to me 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.950
 I will continue until I am weak 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.239
 At some point worthy shows I have a lot 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.830
 wrong but not always 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.239
 Reflected in one night the fabrics 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.129
 fitting everything then brought to zero 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.780
 but hear my head up today 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.460
 that in these substances I was though 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.140
 under pressure never remain at the very 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 ground I have the rules in the future 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.470
 could always because I am one 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.720
 proud human on earth raise my wife 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.699
 and I agree with this gift 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.230
 Fire 1000 battles behind me brother 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.170
 soon you will laugh for that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.269
 We still deserve it back then 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.339
 can only remain strong the view I am 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.930
 a single man but speak for the 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.580
 masses hands stretched in the air and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.150
 let the fire kindle because I am 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.460
 free 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.810
 my parents raised me yet 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.420
 Now I stand myself with my feet 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.740
 on the ground I am free 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 As long as my heart beats I always have 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.729
 another spark hope that still in me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 live and it is time that I mean 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.530
 recognize that because what is not yet 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.150
 that can still be and me alone 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 I'll prove it to everyone 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.110
 fight and thus achieve peace 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.180
 it was not always easy in these 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.649
 cold days because the days were yes and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.060
 in the time that I still have I put 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.560
 ask me the same if I am 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 I'll say that again someday 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 Hope days do not let up 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 I could punish my faith 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.829
 trust because that gave me strength 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.750
 I finally thought clearly and mine 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.609
 it's all in the eyes now 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 Dream and do not wake me up please 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.850
 took years to get on mine 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.259
 First I'll take everything in now 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.549
 the hold could say I am now 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.049
 proud of the bad water 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.939
 black in front of me is made of gold 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.469
 everything I do will be on my heart 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.939
 written and shows if I'm a good one 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.890
 human was up to my soul then 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.929
 gets into the war yet and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.299
 weapons only with rye do not close 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.110
 your heart opens me your experience follow 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.670
 this way 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.470
 you will not understand me either 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.790
 as it is said is a beautiful life 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.650
 because I am free 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.360
 my parents pulled me out 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.210
 but I stand myself with mine 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.680
 feet on the ground I'm free as long as mine 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.420
 I still have heartbeats 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.940
 spark hope that still live in me and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.950
 It is time for me to recognize my way 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.290
 because what is not yet that can yes 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.910
 still, and I alone will 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.230
 prove to everyone I will continue to fight 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.230
 and thus no peace reached
