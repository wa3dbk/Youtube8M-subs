I<00:04:32.310> can<00:04:32.370> avoid<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:33.080> because<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.260> all<00:04:34.380> kind

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
I can avoid that because it's all kind

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.480 
I can avoid that because it's all kind
of<00:04:34.710> filled<00:04:34.890> with<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.070> good<00:04:37.220> wearing<00:04:38.220> gloves

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
of filled with a good wearing gloves

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.700 
of filled with a good wearing gloves
might<00:04:38.760> have<00:04:38.850> been<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.000> good<00:04:39.090> idea<00:04:42.530> okay<00:04:43.530> if

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
might have been a good idea okay if

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.810 
might have been a good idea okay if
everything<00:04:44.130> out<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:45.300> see<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.810> have<00:04:45.960> a

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
everything out you see I have a

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.640 
everything out you see I have a
blackened<00:04:47.820> cookie<00:04:48.090> hole<00:04:48.300> here<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:49.500> going

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
blackened cookie hole here so I'm going

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.469 
blackened cookie hole here so I'm going
to<00:04:49.680> try<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.919> get<00:04:50.130> as<00:04:50.220> much<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:51.330> off

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
to try to get as much of that off

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.640 
to try to get as much of that off
before<00:04:52.080> reinstalling<00:04:52.890> any<00:04:53.280> switch<00:04:54.410> all<00:04:55.410> right

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
before reinstalling any switch all right

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.090 
before reinstalling any switch all right
with<00:04:55.830> some<00:04:56.330> pretty<00:04:57.500> extensive<00:04:58.500> google<00:04:59.539> work

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
with some pretty extensive google work

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.350 
with some pretty extensive google work
it's<00:05:02.100> better<00:05:02.310> it's<00:05:02.669> not<00:05:02.700> perfect<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.240> it's

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
it's better it's not perfect but it's

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.330 
it's better it's not perfect but it's
better<00:05:03.560> good<00:05:04.560> enough

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.980 

all<00:05:08.000> right<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.210> get<00:05:08.300> this<00:05:08.450> through<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.780> think

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
all right to get this through I think

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.810 
all right to get this through I think
the<00:05:09.410> way<00:05:09.590> I<00:05:09.620> do<00:05:09.860> is<00:05:10.070> you've<00:05:10.220> got<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.340> thread<00:05:10.639> all

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
the way I do is you've got a thread all

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.570 
the way I do is you've got a thread all
the<00:05:10.940> other<00:05:11.090> stuff<00:05:11.770> after<00:05:12.770> this<00:05:12.889> after<00:05:13.430> the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
the other stuff after this after the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.430 
the other stuff after this after the
rubber<00:05:14.210> button<00:05:14.600> through<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.350> whole<00:05:15.860> first

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
rubber button through the whole first

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.659 
rubber button through the whole first
because<00:05:18.440> that's<00:05:18.620> why<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.800> looks<00:05:18.980> to<00:05:19.220> me<00:05:19.250> so

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
because that's why it looks to me so

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.320 
because that's why it looks to me so
that's<00:05:20.270> what<00:05:20.480> I<00:05:20.540> did<00:05:21.850> okay<00:05:22.850> with<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.210> new

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
that's what I did okay with the new

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.330 
that's what I did okay with the new
switch<00:05:23.570> push<00:05:23.840> through<00:05:24.200> with<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.830> with<00:05:25.220> the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
switch push through with the with the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.480 
switch push through with the with the
trim<00:05:25.580> piece<00:05:26.500> oriented<00:05:27.500> this<00:05:27.590> way<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:28.250> wire

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
trim piece oriented this way the wire

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.550 
trim piece oriented this way the wire
will<00:05:28.970> be<00:05:29.030> on<00:05:29.270> your<00:05:29.389> right<00:05:29.450> hand<00:05:29.750> side<00:05:32.500> can<00:05:33.500> you

going to make a quick run to the
hardware<00:05:40.430> store<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.870> two<00:05:42.050> screws<00:05:42.410> that

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
hardware store the the two screws that

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.250 
hardware store the the two screws that

were holding the rubber button in are as
I<00:05:45.410> coded<00:05:45.830> in<00:05:45.950> the<00:05:45.980> black<00:05:46.310> tar<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.300> let's

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510

a couple more screws and it should be

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.140 
a couple more screws and it should be
good<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:54.680> go<00:05:54.800> okay<00:05:56.740> there's<00:05:57.740> my<00:05:58.150> replacement
