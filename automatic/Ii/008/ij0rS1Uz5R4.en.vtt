 huge area in just six weeks 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.390
 five large buildings were built here 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.809
 this temporary casing dismounts them as 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.059
 just build the main building 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.629
 migration center it will happen at all 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 soon 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 but now all the conditions are here 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.119
 Convenience: All enclosures are heated here. 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.689
 there are toilets on the most important few 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.850
 tens 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.470
 reception windows in order not to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 created a line here today 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.000
 center for chuka roots which 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 caused great complaints of residents 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 stopped work on accepting new applications 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.329
 6 times increasing payments in 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.970
 city â€‹â€‹budget labor costs 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.729
 Migration and Russian have become close 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.799
 means that the attractiveness of migrants 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.700
 will be less than she was 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.100
 due to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.009
 maybe economic situation but 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 largely financial 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.370
 regulation 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.740
 Well, and the third is of course cleaned huge 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:56.640
 the number of corruption schemes that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.680
 gives participated all visitors pass 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.510
 same way having registered 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.950
 Immediately sent for testing case 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.110
 is that migrants who want 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.810
 get a patent and must know pass 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.520
 exams in history and Russian 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.040
 legislation but the most important thing 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.960
 prove that they are fluent 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.370
 Russian after this need to go 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.040
 medical examination to publish again prints 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.010
 fingers having collected a full package of documents and 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.340
 paying for the migration center 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.040
 can be sent to the paper feed area and 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.480
 the patent will be ready in 10 days but 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.700
 its cost will depend on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.830
 as far as a foreigner is planning 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.230
 stay in Moscow 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.600
 we talked to visitors let's 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.350
 find out what impressions they have from the new 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.580
 center and let's say nurse I can 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.180
 officially work on their own 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.090
 specialty therefore because before 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.180
 because not every clinic had a quota for 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.680
 work with foreigners and now it's the same 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.769
 us on 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.379
 I think it made us a little easier 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.540
 delay they even apologized and you 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.109
 we were treated to tea and coffee we wear today 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.329
 their land of our 8 bit delayed 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:12.739
 Serves epic when it opens 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.930
 main building of the migration center 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.659
 it will happen before the end of the year there besides 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.700
 the services I have already listed will be available 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.769
 visit a bank and a mobile salon 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.040
 also buy air or rail 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.829
 tickets or just have dinner 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.359

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.530

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.530
