00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.899
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.360
 minecraft video and today I'm here to 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.700
 explain how to put names to 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 animals without the need for a mod 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.049
 because I imagine there must be many 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.690
 to do that but not this time we're going 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.300
 to make symbols to do this we are going to 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.310
 need two elements that one that are 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.680
 the labels that are what I'm 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.740
 pulling or the one I have here in my hand and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.080
 others that are good that they are is one that 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.330
 is the anvil for the one who does not know crafter 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.350
 the anvil I explain is very simple that 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.450
 here it is 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.110
 we need three iron blocks if you 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.780
 he needs a lot of iron 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.210
 let's put these blocks of good 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.860
 iron is kraft and so as hero will draw 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.690
 a stack 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.120
 and we are going to let the table of craft theory 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.660
 We filled everything and we came out with a blog that 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.840
 we need three of these 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.110
 and we put them on top and 4 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.090
 normal in this way and we get the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.190
 anvil there is ok once we have 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.500
 the anvil because we need the labels 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.570
 and the labels we get it when 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.700
 we are looking and sometimes we find what 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.090
 that it would be a spa or a spa where 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.100
 skeletons of zombies and then there they come 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 one or two chests I think I do think that two 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.680
 chests and inside your chests sometimes you 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.140
 they sell discs etcetera but sometimes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.940
 also the probability the probability 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.369
 It is very high that they see you from you 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.229
 come find you or you're 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.550
 labels ok so I remember that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 before I did not know the utility for what 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.990
 served but now it does serve to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 name the animals then we take 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 those labels of what's 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.979
 we found in the skeletons' spam 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.280
 and that about zombies and once we have 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.940
 this is going to go to the anvil and we're going to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.890
 place a label here where it says 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.780
 repair and name delete the name 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.900
 cris labeled and we put the name that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.230
 we want for the animal for example 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.690
 what do i know 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.510
 or not 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.970
 cavallÃ­n 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.580
 does not improve the coffee at the moment 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.290
 correctly and here we take it out as 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 you can see it costs us what it would be 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.730
 experience but as it continues creative it does not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.160
 nothing happens to me 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.960
 there is here vallÃ­n let's go for example 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.590
 here is the horse we click 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.080
 right and there says cavallÃ­n now I'm going to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.050
 make another example 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.430
 a label we delete the name that 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.569
 it comes by default and in this case 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.569
 or beijing 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.000
 there is this sheep and we are going to go 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.180
 a sheep here right click and you're done and 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.790
 let's put one chicken 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.290
 let's place here and we will place 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.890
 a man half macabre 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.890
 I 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.189
 breaststroke there is 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.840
 there is support the braza all the craft 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.760
 all the fills all that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.620
 we repair or change the name here in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.470
 the labels will always cost us 5 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.390
 of experience I think let's have the chicken 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.400
 right click and support is a hug it 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.400
 call so that's how you put the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 names the only flaw I see this is 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.299
 that this cross they see in the middle of 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.650
 minecraft that point not this cross then 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.569
 only if we pass it on the animal 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670
 is going to see the name because if not what 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.430
 we take it out or the animal moves it does not look 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.290
 there is we have to put in this course 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.459
 let's say it about the animal for 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.909
 to see the name that is the only 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.430
 detail I do not know if to call it a disadvantage that 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.019
 see and here and nothing so this was all 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.359
 I hope you have liked them 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.889
