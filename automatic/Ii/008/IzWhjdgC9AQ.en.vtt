00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
what I've learned since I've been here

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.350 
what I've learned since I've been here
they're<00:02:43.709> very<00:02:43.950> patient<00:02:44.579> they're<00:02:45.239> very

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
they're very patient they're very

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.940 
they're very patient they're very
politically<00:02:45.930> correct<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.530> terms<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
politically correct in terms of

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.479 
politically correct in terms of
confrontation<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.290> very<00:02:49.290> take<00:02:50.069> things<00:02:50.340> in

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
confrontation and very take things in

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.000 
confrontation and very take things in
stride<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.060> wait<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.480> see<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:52.650> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
stride and wait and see and I think that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.400 
stride and wait and see and I think that
the<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.519> trunk<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.239> new<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.049> they<00:02:55.200> thought

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the the trunk a new this so they thought

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.140 
the the trunk a new this so they thought
well<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.340> about<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.700> easiest

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
well this is this is about the easiest

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.670 
well this is this is about the easiest
country<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.599> Europe<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.109> you<00:02:58.200> want<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
country in Europe if you want to do a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
country in Europe if you want to do a
test<00:02:59.040> run<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.489> grabbing<00:03:00.390> people's<00:03:00.959> savings

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
test run on grabbing people's savings

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500 
test run on grabbing people's savings
this<00:03:01.889> is<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.220> easiest<00:03:02.549> country<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.299> that

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
this is the easiest country to do that

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.020 
this is the easiest country to do that
and<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.829> in<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.099> way<00:03:05.130> you're<00:03:05.489> right<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and so it is in a way you're right it is

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.199 
and so it is in a way you're right it is
a<00:03:06.060> template<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.280> what<00:03:08.280> I'm<00:03:08.400> afraid<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.819> is

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
a template and what I'm afraid of is

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.440 
a template and what I'm afraid of is
that<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.920> know<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:11.970> push<00:03:12.299> these

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that you know that if you push these

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.819 
that you know that if you push these
people<00:03:12.810> too<00:03:12.989> far<00:03:14.209> businesses<00:03:15.209> are<00:03:15.389> closed<00:03:15.569> or

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
people too far businesses are closed or

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.379 
people too far businesses are closed or
scheduled<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.950> close<00:03:17.069> down<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.639> weeks<00:03:18.180> and

scheduled to close down in weeks and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.150 
scheduled to close down in weeks and
months<00:03:18.750> if<00:03:18.930> they<00:03:19.410> can't<00:03:19.680> get<00:03:19.919> their

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
months if they can't get their
