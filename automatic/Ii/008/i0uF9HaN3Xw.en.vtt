her<00:00:34.260> different<00:00:34.440> palettes<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> guess<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.640> then

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
her different palettes I guess and then

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.250 
her different palettes I guess and then
there's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.540> sample<00:00:37.079> card<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
there's a little like sample card with a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.840 
there's a little like sample card with a
blush<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.530> looks<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.219> three<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
blush it looks like and then three I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.959 
blush it looks like and then three I
colors<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.920> look<00:00:44.460> for

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
colors and this is from the look for

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.619 
colors and this is from the look for
natural<00:00:45.809> talent<00:00:46.350> palette<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> guess<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.820> just

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
natural talent palette I guess so just

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.040 
natural talent palette I guess so just
teeny<00:00:49.320> tiny<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:50.010> cards<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.059> hoping<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
teeny tiny like cards if I'm hoping this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.979 
teeny tiny like cards if I'm hoping this
is<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.550> samples<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.960> are

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is not like one of the samples that are

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
is not like one of the samples that are
actually<00:00:55.170> counted<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> bag<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
actually counted in the bag because that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.330 
actually counted in the bag because that
would<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.960> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> sad<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.219> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
would be kind of sad but that was in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490 
would be kind of sad but that was in
there<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> looks<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.289> theme

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.000 
my last bag I think like I've mentioned
before<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.970> am<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> waterproof<00:02:20.290> mascara<00:02:20.800> we're

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
before I am a waterproof mascara we're

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.250 
before I am a waterproof mascara we're
so<00:02:21.489> getting<00:02:21.970> like<00:02:22.270> sample<00:02:22.599> mascara<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.080> this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
so getting like sample mascara like this

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
so getting like sample mascara like this
doesn't<00:02:23.500> really<00:02:23.800> benefit<00:02:24.459> me<00:02:24.580> all<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.910> much

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
doesn't really benefit me all that much

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.210 
doesn't really benefit me all that much
I<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.540> usually<00:02:25.720> save<00:02:26.170> them<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.560> give<00:02:27.190> them

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I just usually save them and give them

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.720 
I just usually save them and give them
away<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.390> from<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.099> big<00:02:30.400> I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
away but this is from it's so big I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.100 
away but this is from it's so big I
guess<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.330> brand<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:31.989> their

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
guess that's the brand this is their

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.080 
guess that's the brand this is their
volumizing<00:02:33.010> mascara<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.700> guess<00:02:33.849> it's<00:02:34.030> just

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
volumizing mascara and I guess it's just

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.070 
volumizing mascara and I guess it's just
in<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:35.140> black<00:02:35.470> shade<00:02:35.860> next<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.489> have<00:02:36.760> a
