it's<00:00:22.830> called<00:00:23.010> imaginary<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.760> can't

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's called imaginary because you can't

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
it's called imaginary because you can't
have<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> real<00:00:25.170> number

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
have this with a real number

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
have this with a real number
anything<00:00:26.400> squared<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.880> always<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> be

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
anything squared is always going to be

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.870 
anything squared is always going to be
positive<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.740> also<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.400> could<00:00:29.609> also<00:00:29.730> be

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
positive and also this could also be

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.130 
positive and also this could also be
written<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.500> square<00:00:31.830> both<00:00:32.070> sides<00:00:32.099> I

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
written as if you square both sides I

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.520 
written as if you square both sides I
equals<00:00:34.140> negative<00:00:34.590> 1<00:00:36.020> if<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.110> can't<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
equals negative 1 if you can't have the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
equals negative 1 if you can't have the
even<00:00:38.309> though<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.460> can't<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.149> still

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
even though you can't have this we still

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.330 
even though you can't have this we still
have<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.559> comes<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.100> in

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
have this because it comes up in

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.930 
have this because it comes up in
equations<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.200> only<00:00:43.410> solve<00:00:44.280> by

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
equations that we can only solve by

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
equations that we can only solve by
using<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.690> definition<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.559> let's<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:47.160> with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
using this definition so let's go with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.690 
using this definition so let's go with
an<00:00:47.430> example<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> illustrate<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:49.700> definition

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
an example to illustrate this definition

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.229 
an example to illustrate this definition
let's<00:00:51.120> say<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:52.579> quadratic<00:00:53.579> formula

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
let's say you have quadratic formula

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.349 
let's say you have quadratic formula
like<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.980> x<00:00:55.980> squared<00:00:56.489> minus<00:00:56.910> 4x<00:00:57.570> plus<00:01:00.289> plus<00:01:01.289> 5

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
like this x squared minus 4x plus plus 5

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
like this x squared minus 4x plus plus 5
equals<00:01:03.359> 0<00:01:03.449> ok<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.830> were<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> solve<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
equals 0 ok so if we were to solve this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.250 
equals 0 ok so if we were to solve this
we<00:01:05.670> would<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.540> quadratic<00:01:07.470> formula<00:01:09.260> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
we would use a quadratic formula you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.560 
we would use a quadratic formula you

beyond<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.650> proved<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> quadratic

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
beyond which I proved the quadratic

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.320 
beyond which I proved the quadratic
formula<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:18.240> end<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> quadratic

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
formula and what end and the quadratic

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
formula and what end and the quadratic
formula<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.900> basically<00:01:22.170> x<00:01:23.119> equals<00:01:24.770> negative<00:01:25.770> b

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
formula is basically x equals negative b

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.440 
formula is basically x equals negative b
plus<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:27.090> minus<00:01:27.150> square<00:01:28.130> root<00:01:29.130> b<00:01:29.939> squared

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
plus or minus square root b squared

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.520 
plus or minus square root b squared
minus<00:01:31.040> 4ac<00:01:33.200> all<00:01:35.630> divided<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:37.520> 2a<00:01:39.049> in<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.259> case

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
minus 4ac all divided by 2a in this case

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.800 
minus 4ac all divided by 2a in this case
we<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.520> equal<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> 1<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
we have a is equal to 1 that's this

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.670 
we have a is equal to 1 that's this
coefficient<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.299> B<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> negative<00:01:45.869> 4<00:01:46.439> negative

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
coefficient and B is negative 4 negative

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
coefficient and B is negative 4 negative
4<00:01:47.310> Gizem<00:01:47.729> definition<00:01:48.630> had<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.399> plus<00:01:50.399> b<00:01:50.670> okay<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
4 Gizem definition had a plus b okay and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.850 
4 Gizem definition had a plus b okay and
then<00:01:51.630> c<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.560> equal<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.180> 5

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
then c is equal to 5

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.459 
then c is equal to 5
yep<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.219> plug<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.149> x<00:01:58.020> equals

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
yep so if we plug it in we get x equals

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
yep so if we plug it in we get x equals
negative<00:02:01.729> negative<00:02:02.729> 4<00:02:03.259> which<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.290> b<00:02:05.030> plus<00:02:06.030> or

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
negative negative 4 which is b plus or

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.980 
negative negative 4 which is b plus or
minus<00:02:08.330> negative<00:02:09.330> 4<00:02:09.840> b<00:02:10.679> squared<00:02:11.160> minus<00:02:11.310> 4

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
minus negative 4 b squared minus 4

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.120 
minus negative 4 b squared minus 4
times<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:14.670> 1<00:02:15.120> times<00:02:16.020> C<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.590> 5<00:02:18.770> write<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.950> all

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
times a is 1 times C is 5 write this all

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.700 
times a is 1 times C is 5 write this all
over<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:21.660> divided<00:02:22.620> by<00:02:24.440> 2<00:02:25.440> times<00:02:25.980> 1<00:02:27.200> okay<00:02:28.200> so

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
over it all divided by 2 times 1 okay so

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.440 
over it all divided by 2 times 1 okay so
if<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.890> simplify<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.910> becomes<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:31.380> 4

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
if we simplify this this becomes just 4

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.000 
if we simplify this this becomes just 4
plus<00:02:33.450> or<00:02:33.660> minus<00:02:34.820> I'll<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:36.060> divide<00:02:36.240> out<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.570> 2

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
plus or minus I'll just divide out the 2

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.570 
plus or minus I'll just divide out the 2
4<00:02:38.010> divided<00:02:38.400> by<00:02:38.490> 2<00:02:38.550> plus<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.240> minus<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:41.340> would

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
4 divided by 2 plus or minus this would

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.210 
4 divided by 2 plus or minus this would
be<00:02:41.670> square<00:02:41.730> root<00:02:43.070> 4<00:02:44.990> let's<00:02:45.990> erase<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.290> 16

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.960 

negative<00:02:50.220> 4<00:02:50.430> squared<00:02:50.790> sells<00:02:51.030> positive<00:02:51.600> 16

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
negative 4 squared sells positive 16

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.820 
negative 4 squared sells positive 16
minus<00:02:53.970> 20<00:02:55.220> all<00:02:56.220> divided<00:02:56.760> by<00:02:56.790> 2

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
minus 20 all divided by 2

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.020 
minus 20 all divided by 2
now<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.010> simplify<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.430> even<00:02:59.640> more<00:02:59.880> you

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
now if you simplify this even more you

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.180 
now if you simplify this even more you
get<00:03:00.620> 2<00:03:01.620> plus<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.520> minus<00:03:03.830> that's<00:03:04.830> gonna<00:03:05.010> be

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
get 2 plus or minus that's gonna be

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.390 
get 2 plus or minus that's gonna be
negative<00:03:05.910> 4<00:03:06.330> over<00:03:06.360> 2<00:03:08.240> negative<00:03:10.370> negative<00:03:11.370> 4

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
negative 4 over 2 negative negative 4

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.050 
negative 4 over 2 negative negative 4
all<00:03:14.400> over<00:03:14.430> 2<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:16.440> now<00:03:16.590> that's<00:03:16.800> for<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:17.910> can

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
all over 2 so now that's for this we can

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.330 
all over 2 so now that's for this we can
get<00:03:18.270> before<00:03:18.960> applying<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.800> imaginary

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
get before applying the imaginary

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.750 
get before applying the imaginary
numbers<00:03:20.580> as<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.300> see<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:22.670> there's<00:03:23.670> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
numbers as you can see I there's a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
numbers as you can see I there's a
negative<00:03:23.970> 4<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.510> can't<00:03:24.840> square<00:03:25.320> root<00:03:25.500> it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
negative 4 we can't square root it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.770 
negative 4 we can't square root it
because<00:03:25.770> we<00:03:25.890> we<00:03:26.880> can't<00:03:27.090> use<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.390> with<00:03:27.510> just

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
because we we can't use it with just

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.300 
because we we can't use it with just
conventional<00:03:28.410> method<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.040> have<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.220> use

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
conventional method so you have to use

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.550 
conventional method so you have to use
an<00:03:29.400> imaginary<00:03:29.760> number<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:31.050> we<00:03:31.200> write<00:03:31.440> it

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
an imaginary number so if we write it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.260 
an imaginary number so if we write it
further<00:03:31.860> we<00:03:32.100> could<00:03:32.250> further<00:03:32.460> simplify<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
further we could further simplify it to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.440 
further we could further simplify it to
go<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.780> plus<00:03:34.050> or<00:03:34.200> minus<00:03:35.000> let's<00:03:36.000> go<00:03:36.240> with<00:03:38.450> square

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
go to plus or minus let's go with square

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.900 
go to plus or minus let's go with square
root<00:03:39.860> negative<00:03:40.860> 1<00:03:42.230> times<00:03:43.880> square<00:03:44.880> root<00:03:44.910> 4<00:03:46.910> we

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
root negative 1 times square root 4 we

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.430 
root negative 1 times square root 4 we
could<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.210> that<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.660> by<00:03:48.810> taking<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.290> negative

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
could do that just by taking a negative

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.860 
could do that just by taking a negative
1<00:03:49.740> out<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:50.640> then<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:52.230> all<00:03:52.440> divided<00:03:52.680> by<00:03:52.830> 2

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
1 out and then this is all divided by 2

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.140 
1 out and then this is all divided by 2
square<00:03:54.870> root<00:03:54.990> of<00:03:55.050> 4<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.320> 2<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.880> we<00:03:56.910> could

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
square root of 4 is 2 so we could

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150 
square root of 4 is 2 so we could
simplify<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:57.630> week<00:03:58.020> google<00:03:58.350> plus<00:03:59.040> or

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
simplify this more week google plus or

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.770 
simplify this more week google plus or
minus<00:03:59.580> this<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.660> 2<00:04:01.110> &amp;<00:04:01.500> 2<00:04:02.310> divided<00:04:02.730> by<00:04:02.760> 2<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.180> 2

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
minus this is 2 &amp; 2 divided by 2 is 2

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.030 
minus this is 2 &amp; 2 divided by 2 is 2
zit<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.560> 1<00:04:04.800> so<00:04:05.130> they<00:04:05.250> cancel<00:04:06.440> so<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.560> cancel

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
zit is 1 so they cancel so they cancel

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.290 
zit is 1 so they cancel so they cancel
so<00:04:08.460> you'll<00:04:08.640> get<00:04:09.500> ya<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.490> cancels<00:04:11.880> with

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
so you'll get ya so this cancels with

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.260 
so you'll get ya so this cancels with
that<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:13.310> then<00:04:14.310> we'll<00:04:14.490> just<00:04:14.760> left<00:04:15.030> with

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
that and then we'll just left with

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.380 
that and then we'll just left with
negative<00:04:15.620> 1<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.010> from<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.700> definition<00:04:18.239> we

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
negative 1 and from the definition we

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.310 
negative 1 and from the definition we
have<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:19.020> I<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:21.150> equal<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.840> square<00:04:22.140> root

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
have it there I is equal to square root

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.909 
have it there I is equal to square root
of<00:04:22.650> 1<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.130> then<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.510> equals<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.780> 2<00:04:25.140> plus<00:04:25.710> or

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
of 1 so then this equals to 2 plus or

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.510 
of 1 so then this equals to 2 plus or
minus

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
minus

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.210 
minus
I<00:04:28.789> so<00:04:29.789> that<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.629> solution<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:32.009> plus

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
I so that is the solution to it the plus

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.990 
I so that is the solution to it the plus
or<00:04:32.370> minus<00:04:32.639> means<00:04:33.000> we<00:04:33.240> can<00:04:33.569> have<00:04:33.599> x<00:04:34.349> equals<00:04:35.000> say

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
or minus means we can have x equals say

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.719 
or minus means we can have x equals say
X<00:04:36.210> 1<00:04:36.509> is<00:04:36.659> equal<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:37.460> 2<00:04:38.460> plus<00:04:38.729> I<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.830> X<00:04:40.830> 2<00:04:41.370> is

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
X 1 is equal to 2 plus I and X 2 is

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.230 
X 1 is equal to 2 plus I and X 2 is
equal<00:04:41.819> to<00:04:42.169> 2<00:04:43.169> minus<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.879> so<00:04:44.879> if<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.030> were<00:04:45.090> to

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
equal to 2 minus I so if you were to

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.469 
equal to 2 minus I so if you were to
draw<00:04:45.479> this<00:04:45.659> in<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:46.080> graph<00:04:46.530> showing<00:04:47.479> real

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
draw this in a graph showing real

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.140 
draw this in a graph showing real

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
numbers which coefficient is 1 so we'll

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.149

just C which is equal to which is equal
to<00:05:43.380> there's<00:05:44.159> a<00:05:44.219> 2<00:05:44.430> squared<00:05:44.960> plus<00:05:45.960> 1<00:05:46.440> squared

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
to there's a 2 squared plus 1 squared

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:52.939 
to there's a 2 squared plus 1 squared
all<00:05:47.400> squared<00:05:48.469> so<00:05:49.469> that<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:50.279> 4<00:05:50.819> plus<00:05:51.500> this<00:05:52.500> is<00:05:52.650> 4

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
all squared so that is 4 plus this is 4

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.980 
all squared so that is 4 plus this is 4
plus<00:05:52.979> 1<00:05:55.219> and<00:05:56.219> this<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.669> from<00:05:56.969> the<00:05:57.360> Pythagoras

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
plus 1 and this is from the Pythagoras

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.040 
plus 1 and this is from the Pythagoras
theorem<00:05:59.840> let<00:06:00.840> me<00:06:00.990> just<00:06:01.259> once<00:06:01.650> okay<00:06:02.130> so<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.699> is

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
theorem let me just once okay so this is

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.959

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
to see the video they do that well this

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.019 
to see the video they do that well this
is<00:06:30.539> all<00:06:30.750> there<00:06:31.560> is<00:06:31.710> basically<00:06:32.610> the

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
is all there is basically the

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.670 
is all there is basically the
introduction<00:06:33.569> to<00:06:33.690> imaginary<00:06:34.080> numbers<00:06:34.440> and

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
introduction to imaginary numbers and

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.589 
introduction to imaginary numbers and
that's<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:35.130> definition<00:06:35.310> this<00:06:36.029> how<00:06:36.240> you<00:06:36.479> could

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
that's the definition this how you could

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:40.480 
that's the definition this how you could
use<00:06:36.630> it<00:06:36.810> to<00:06:36.960> solve<00:06:37.380> equations<00:06:38.250> that<00:06:39.180> have

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
use it to solve equations that have

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.270 
use it to solve equations that have
that<00:06:41.490> that<00:06:41.850> involve<00:06:42.889> square<00:06:43.889> root<00:06:44.039> of<00:06:44.190> a

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
that that involve square root of a

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.800 
that that involve square root of a
negative<00:06:44.430> number<00:06:44.729> what<00:06:44.940> you<00:06:45.090> can't<00:06:45.330> do<00:06:45.509> unless

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
negative number what you can't do unless

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.860 
negative number what you can't do unless
you<00:06:46.190> apply<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.250> definition<00:06:47.550> of<00:06:48.000> imagining

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
you apply the definition of imagining

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.450 
you apply the definition of imagining
numbers<00:06:49.430> well<00:06:50.430> that's<00:06:51.240> all<00:06:52.070> well<00:06:53.070> that's<00:06:53.280> all

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
numbers well that's all well that's all

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.610 
numbers well that's all well that's all
