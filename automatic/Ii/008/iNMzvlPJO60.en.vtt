00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.319
 commentary 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.930
 on battlefield bad company 2 not on the extension so more 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.039

 we are with the quellec the two beauties oneself balances 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 sorry if I have corsican

 your nickname 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.860
 he must play 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.650
 to the sector on the nine-week-old baby map hit a year ago and June 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.500
 these reindeer panels 7th which like that and for 100 m 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.270
 tokyo what was brought a little peculiarity what he lived and the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.269
 past viewfinder where I do not know if it's called like that 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.269
 his baptism at home in any case it's a powerful language association 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.330
 on call of duty 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.390
 p 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.830
 soon you'll see that it does not play a lot the goal is that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.420
 it's going to be an express part again as in the video because a good one 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 again the juniors get dominated you'll see that he plays with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.410
 this if you can see it down there 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.760
 next to the map 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.440
 always like you with this squad mare his 402 wish to 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.120
 sneakers 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.300
 heyer they'll have to split the task for you 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330
 to describe the goals know that there they did not do it but from 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.130
 of the next 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.760
 I want to do something that really and unravel to have watched 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760
 yes the enemy who just had 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.009
 he has a small arrow renault bush over his head is clear 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.240
 it's his colleagues from the rest a little who have scored enemies for them 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.010
 can cash receipts and devices 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.780
 p it allows him to be 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.130
 one of the climates 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.170
 Finally, it was painful that he had his effect 3 nantes had to pay for assistance but 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.560
 it allows to spot the enemies and kill the man through the trees 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.210
 we did not 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.890
 it's silly but I get killed on the side and he was not looking at his back 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.850
 side is a winners who does and she 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.920
 this is the game of squatters 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.259
 no the company and its novels 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.399
 I want you can play squad 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.709
 because 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.769
 if you play alone already it's not the same atmosphere I'm not the same 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.159
 error game experience 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.640
 but he is already much more fun 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.149
 d 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.149
 but how to say his ideas is not easier but 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.979
 more chances of success when playing for squats so basically 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.019
 that's what I like about this game 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.359
 it's the fact that 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.659
 dardenne points for everything and anything but he does it 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.669
 especially we do not say anything and everything but it's positive 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.079
 since 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.349
 as soon as we do something positive for the hassenforder team of experts 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.929
 point for example 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.239
 the common cocom cup someone is taking points it's pretty normal 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.240
 kills someone while he is in the process of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.020
 the goal is to create a page you must have the bomb 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.570
 50 points for kivu plus 30 points of defense when we know that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.060
 I'm made a note to one of our colleagues kill the enemy who comes 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.760
 to kill 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.369
 we do not have a elected 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.410
 do not get a better support of the points because the other one is a ranger 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.880
 if you eat you have 50 points lower price and that's when I could 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.909
 spend the night there you are mika 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.080
 we have points especially and it's really good because it 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.139
 ceara 6 so we can squad 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.710
 all runners 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.750
 why the game he says the show he does not play in records that's why 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.159
 the touched cv who will recover his life 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.159
 because I am I really play three records 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.079
 created pretty nonstop hygiene and I still play so less I need a 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.249
 doctor as soon as I get enough of his romance with his symbols 1 2 3 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.119
 sixteen armand hit 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.809
 little he was between his handgun and his army 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.369
 long-range 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.989
 he's really very mobile and then at home do you mean see he has they 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.209
 are laid on basic steps at the same time so that the enemies are 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.999
 confused his part on which toxic assets follis 2nd a scop they go 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.469
 go to rome 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.079
 on a base to destroy it 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.249
 m 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.499
 in his novels at best they will go on a base for d3 to another 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.389
 here 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.199
 exposed since it can not be are both bases at the same time 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.729
 because you could really well 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.630
 or so also its staggered base exploded they did not have time so to 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.279
 this defense 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.429
 wauquiez he is in a hurry to go he land the other two bases out 

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:34.429
 the game presence finally 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.040
 so we can really ten years after a good job of squats in the sounds 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.710
 they are very organized 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.870
 and there I saw were already on the last two bases destroy for 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.979
 this end of the game 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.979
 what am I doing well because I have other 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.819
 mm 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.469
 no but hey we saw that they are taking 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.129
 back up 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.889
 quickly get back to the places to be able to 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.110
 they take possession of the places so that others can not go 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.039
 she is full 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.749
 to defuse the ip from the terminals look oki are possessed to ask 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:10.530
 in the abbey 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.089
 they will soon pose in the pretty defense page yes there he had 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:20.249
 a weight for bravo because I have him he defended his point and more because 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.619
 that the expert recorded on everything he did his girls in a party 

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:25.689
 that the sector is a slide show 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.930
 many points have traces 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.480
 karate it's a pity his colleague left to kill him also planned 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.009
 are laid on not 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.259
 so they go they'll take the position by watching the people of 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.659
 exposed there are still some steps 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.740
 with the end of the game 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.440
 but I say you have to digest four of you because it's really brother 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.440
 well organized beating you will eat it change what 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.089

 it's a small comment also for the median and if it goes better too 

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:09.159
 which also encourages things to be corrected 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.139
 I'm worried all the time things to fix it does not catch up 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.270
 legend to correct them for you 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.879

 game to change all that for what it will be still that it is even more 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:25.180
