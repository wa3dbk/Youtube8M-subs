sizing<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> masked<00:01:02.430> man<00:01:02.579> there's<00:01:02.850> two

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
sizing of this masked man there's two

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
sizing of this masked man there's two
sides<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
sides of this one there is this is the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.969 
sides of this one there is this is the
basic<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.549> which<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.600> three<00:01:07.530> hundred<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.920> ten

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
basic one which is three hundred and ten

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.149 
basic one which is three hundred and ten
millimeters<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:09.799> 230<00:01:10.799> millimeters

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
millimeters there by 230 millimeters

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429 
millimeters there by 230 millimeters
that<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> big<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that way and there's a big one which is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.609 
that way and there's a big one which is
called<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> gain<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> gamer<00:01:14.939> pro<00:01:15.270> XXL<00:01:15.990> which

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
called the gain of gamer pro XXL which

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.350 
called the gain of gamer pro XXL which
is<00:01:17.450> 425<00:01:18.450> millimeters<00:01:18.930> across<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:20.360> 315

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
is 425 millimeters across and 315

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690 
is 425 millimeters across and 315
millimeters<00:01:21.780> down<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> size<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
millimeters down so that's the size of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.810 
millimeters down so that's the size of
this<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.530> as<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.590> said<00:01:25.710> before<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.220> 0.8

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this one and as I said before is 0.8

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.219 
this one and as I said before is 0.8
millimeters<00:01:27.270> thick<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> look

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
millimeters thick so if you have a look

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
millimeters thick so if you have a look
there<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.890> zoom<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.549> edge

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
there if you can zoom on to that edge

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.210 
there if you can zoom on to that edge
Henry<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.780> how<00:01:30.960> absolutely<00:01:31.680> thin<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
backing is really thin it's not like a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
backing is really thin it's not like a
piece<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> rubber<00:01:37.500> anything<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.130> a

piece of rubber anything on here just a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
piece of rubber anything on here just a
really<00:01:38.640> thin<00:01:38.880> piece<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.570> almost<00:01:39.920> so

really thin piece of like lot almost so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
really thin piece of like lot almost so
this<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.790> nice<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:43.259> desk<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.100> to

it'll<00:01:48.180> blend<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.570> too<00:01:48.720> much<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.990> white

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it'll blend in too much the white

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.389 
it'll blend in too much the white
background<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.710> check<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:50.040> any<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.340> you

in dead last on my desk as well and now

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
in dead last on my desk as well and now
for<00:02:00.810> performance<00:02:01.619> wise<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> lot<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
for performance wise there's a lot that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.950 
for performance wise there's a lot that
goes<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.299> mouse<00:02:03.509> make<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> good

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
goes in this mouse make a good

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.929 
goes in this mouse make a good
performance<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.469> we've<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:04.939> something

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
performance so we've got something

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.399 
performance so we've got something
called<00:02:06.180> high<00:02:06.420> resolution<00:02:06.899> performance<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
called high resolution performance of

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.479 
called high resolution performance of
what<00:02:07.500> they're<00:02:07.590> called<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.979> basically<00:02:08.129> on

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
what they're called it and basically on

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.949 
what they're called it and basically on
top<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.819> mouths<00:02:09.030> mouths<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.810> have

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
top of the mouths mouths they have

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.900 
top of the mouths mouths they have
painted<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.619> special<00:02:10.920> coating<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.459> mean

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
painted it with a special coating I mean

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.130 
painted it with a special coating I mean
this<00:02:12.000> special<00:02:12.300> coating<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.720> suit<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> can

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
this special coating if we suit you can

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.820 
this special coating if we suit you can
really<00:02:13.379> actually

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
really actually

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.140 
really actually
if<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.070> look<00:02:14.190> closely<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> but

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
if you look closely you can see it but

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.180 
if you look closely you can see it but
there<00:02:15.300> are<00:02:15.420> thousands<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.110> tiny<00:02:16.440> tiny<00:02:16.770> dots<00:02:17.010> on

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
there are thousands of tiny tiny dots on

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
there are thousands of tiny tiny dots on
here<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.120> zoom<00:02:18.150> into<00:02:18.510> little<00:02:18.870> marketing

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
here if we zoom into little marketing

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.830 
here if we zoom into little marketing
picture<00:02:19.410> here<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.300> these

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
picture here and you can see that these

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.450 
picture here and you can see that these
dots<00:02:22.230> are<00:02:22.650> printed<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.130> there<00:02:23.310> they're

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
dots are printed on there they're

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.010 
dots are printed on there they're
tattooed<00:02:23.820> in<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.510> what<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.720> does<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.990> it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
tattooed in so what this does is it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.930 
tattooed in so what this does is it
helps<00:02:25.380> with<00:02:25.560> your<00:02:25.650> mouse<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.190> LED<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.670> laser

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
helps with your mouse is LED or laser

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.900 
helps with your mouse is LED or laser
and<00:02:27.330> optical<00:02:27.980> mice<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.280> helps<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.610> pick<00:02:29.790> up

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and optical mice and it helps to pick up

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.310 
and optical mice and it helps to pick up
the<00:02:30.030> resolution<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.690> basically<00:02:30.780> means<00:02:31.170> is

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
the resolution so it basically means is

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.320 
the resolution so it basically means is
really<00:02:31.650> good<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.130> pick<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:32.730> by<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.940> mouse<00:02:33.150> on

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
really good and pick up by the mouse on

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.550 
really good and pick up by the mouse on
this<00:02:33.450> system<00:02:33.810> because<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.290> got<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.530> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
this system because it's got like a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.980 
this system because it's got like a
pattern<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.100> not<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> flat<00:02:35.550> service

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
pattern it's not just a flat service

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.420 
pattern it's not just a flat service
because<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.110> mouse<00:02:37.320> recognizes<00:02:37.980> movement<00:02:38.310> by

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
because the mouse recognizes movement by

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.620 
because the mouse recognizes movement by
looking<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.760> pattern<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.270> it's<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.570> help

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
looking at pattern so it's going to help

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.590 
looking at pattern so it's going to help
your<00:02:39.780> mouse<00:02:39.990> track<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.650> nicely<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.600> glide

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
your mouse track really nicely and glide

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.970 
your mouse track really nicely and glide
on<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.140> I'm<00:02:43.260> honest<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.620> wasn't<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
on this if I'm honest I wasn't that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.480 
on this if I'm honest I wasn't that
happy<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> glide<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:46.800> smooth<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
happy with the glide and it's smooth and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.090 
happy with the glide and it's smooth and
it<00:02:47.640> goes<00:02:47.790> fast<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.870> felt<00:02:49.440> better<00:02:49.650> from

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
it goes fast but it's I felt better from

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.730 
it goes fast but it's I felt better from
like<00:02:50.600> learning<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:51.750> soft<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.080> mouse<00:02:52.260> mat<00:02:52.500> so

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
like learning it's soft and mouse mat so

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.260 
like learning it's soft and mouse mat so
like<00:02:52.920> obviously<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.640> can't<00:02:53.880> really<00:02:53.970> compare

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
like obviously you can't really compare

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.550 
like obviously you can't really compare
the<00:02:54.450> soft<00:02:54.690> master<00:02:54.959> map<00:02:55.050> because<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.350> slower

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the soft master map because it's slower

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.010 
the soft master map because it's slower
and<00:02:55.940> but<00:02:56.940> say<00:02:57.209> for<00:02:57.360> example<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.720> rock<00:02:57.870> out

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and but say for example a rock out

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.930 
and but say for example a rock out
Souter<00:02:58.320> maybe<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> better<00:02:59.520> gladdens

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
Souter maybe you get a better gladdens

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.120 
Souter maybe you get a better gladdens
on<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> plastic<00:03:00.480> ones<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.860> glide<00:03:02.010> is

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
on the plastic ones and so the glide is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.170 
on the plastic ones and so the glide is
particularly<00:03:02.459> smooth<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.850> here<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.090> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
particularly smooth on here but it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.160 
particularly smooth on here but it
obviously<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.630> good<00:03:03.780> glad<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.080> you're

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
obviously is a good glad if you're

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.630 
obviously is a good glad if you're
moving<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.530> around<00:03:04.590> yo<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.340> good<00:03:05.490> enough

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
moving it around yo it's a good enough

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.250 
moving it around yo it's a good enough
surface<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:06.209> not<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> smoothest<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.990> glider

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

loose Virginia to chop but overall I

came out I was pretty good I think the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.390 
came out I was pretty good I think the
best<00:04:10.080> feature<00:04:10.320> obviously<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.980> tracking

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
I think that's a bit too expensive and i

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.940 
I think that's a bit too expensive and i
get<00:04:23.850> i<00:04:24.030> guess<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.419> most<00:04:24.539> you'll<00:04:24.780> agree<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.890> it

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
get i guess the most you'll agree but it

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.260 
get i guess the most you'll agree but it
is<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.070> nice<00:04:26.220> piece<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.490> kit<00:04:26.820> i<00:04:26.850> guess<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.210> you

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
is a nice piece of kit i guess if you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.440 
is a nice piece of kit i guess if you
have

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
have

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.300
