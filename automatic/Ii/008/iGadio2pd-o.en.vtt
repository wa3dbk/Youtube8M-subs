00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
temperature manufacturers that actually

creates select sections in a black

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.569 
creates select sections in a black
finish<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> they're<00:01:01.980> perfect<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.370> this

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
finish and they're perfect for this

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789 
finish and they're perfect for this
prior<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.840> an<00:01:04.049> installer<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.500> used

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
prior to this as an installer you used

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.070 
prior to this as an installer you used
to<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.309> paint<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> pipe<00:01:06.090> after<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.900> pass

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to have to paint the pipe after you pass

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.980 
to have to paint the pipe after you pass
through<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> wall<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> could<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> real

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
through the wall and it could be a real

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.179 
through the wall and it could be a real
pain<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.439> paint<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> stainless

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
pain to paint some of that stainless

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
pain to paint some of that stainless
pipe<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> would<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> typical

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pipe so this would be a typical

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.850 
pipe so this would be a typical
installation<00:01:14.189> you've<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:15.650> your<00:01:16.650> wall

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
installation you've got your wall

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
installation you've got your wall
thimble<00:01:17.130> setup<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:17.970> through<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.330> wall

thimble setup that's through your wall

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
thimble setup that's through your wall
you<00:01:19.020> run<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.650> piece<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.540> glass<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.720> pipe

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you run your piece of glass a pipe

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
you run your piece of glass a pipe
through<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> wall<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.430> make

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
through the wall now you have to make

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
through the wall now you have to make
your<00:01:23.820> connection<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:25.320> single<00:01:25.770> wall<00:01:26.040> pipe

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
your connection to your single wall pipe

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.090 
your connection to your single wall pipe
and<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> note<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.840> believe<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and just as a note I believe that the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.060 
and just as a note I believe that the
actual<00:01:29.610> distance<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> room<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.860> your

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
actual distance into the room from your

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
actual distance into the room from your
wall<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> six<00:01:33.180> inch<00:01:33.299> clearance<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:34.110> not

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
wall is a six inch clearance I'm not

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
wall is a six inch clearance I'm not
positive<00:01:34.590> you'd<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> check<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.030> your

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
positive you'd want to check with your

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
positive you'd want to check with your
local<00:01:36.299> codes<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.079> check<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.880> specs<00:01:38.880> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
local codes or check with the specs on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.819 
local codes or check with the specs on
the<00:01:39.119> pipe<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.200> six<00:01:40.380> inches<00:01:40.560> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the pipe but I think it's six inches so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
the pipe but I think it's six inches so
this<00:01:40.979> isn't<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.280> great<00:01:41.430> example<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:41.939> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
this isn't a great example because it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.310 
this isn't a great example because it
doesn't<00:01:42.420> come<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> room<00:01:42.960> far<00:01:43.200> enough

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
doesn't come into the room far enough

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520 
doesn't come into the room far enough
but<00:01:43.649> anyways<00:01:44.540> we're<00:01:45.540> using<00:01:45.750> our<00:01:46.020> finishing

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
but anyways we're using our finishing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
but anyways we're using our finishing
collar<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.820> gonna<00:01:48.060> twist<00:01:48.540> lock

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
collar then which is gonna twist lock

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
collar then which is gonna twist lock
right<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.500> our<00:01:49.619> piece<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.009> pipe<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:51.210> we

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
right into our piece of pipe and then we

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.980 
right into our piece of pipe and then we
can<00:01:51.479> take<00:01:51.659> our<00:01:51.810> single<00:01:52.350> wall<00:01:52.530> whether<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> be

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
can take our single wall whether it be
