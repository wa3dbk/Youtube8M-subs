00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
compare the oh wait the 13 is C 40 well

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.840 
compare the oh wait the 13 is C 40 well
compared<00:01:11.270> here<00:01:11.799> tires<00:01:12.799> definitely<00:01:13.670> look

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
compared here tires definitely look

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.410 
compared here tires definitely look
massive<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.570> me<00:01:15.490> compared<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:17.229> 35

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
massive to me compared to the 35

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.210 
massive to me compared to the 35
everywhere

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.490 

this<00:01:26.220> summer<00:01:26.400> looks<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.910> thought<00:01:27.090> for

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
this summer looks like the thought for

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.450 
this summer looks like the thought for
thirty-sevens<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> looks

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
they look like I said massive but uh

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.750 
they look like I said massive but uh
especially<00:01:35.490> compared<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.650> my<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.680> JK<00:01:38.220> 35

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
especially compared to my other JK 35

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.030 
especially compared to my other JK 35
they<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.660> lot<00:01:39.870> bigger<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.410> least<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.800> curse

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they get a lot bigger at least in curse

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.560

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
I'm basically done with the lift I got

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.720 
I'm basically done with the lift I got
my<00:02:07.840> Magnaflow<00:02:08.500> put<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:08.979> today<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:11.610> got<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
my Magnaflow put in today and got the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.850 
my Magnaflow put in today and got the
lift<00:02:12.940> done<00:02:13.360> except<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.590> steering

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
lift done except for the steering

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.740 
lift done except for the steering
stabilizer<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:16.060> needs<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:16.720> on

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
stabilizer I think needs to be put on

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.130 
stabilizer I think needs to be put on
still<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.349> other<00:02:17.500> than<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:18.870> pretty<00:02:19.870> much

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
still but other than that pretty much

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.110 
still but other than that pretty much
done<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.220> good<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:21.700> it's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
done it's really good I think it's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.030 
done it's really good I think it's
really<00:02:22.810> really<00:02:23.200> big

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
really really big

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
really really big
a<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:25.540> nervous<00:02:26.380> about<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.680> off<00:02:26.830> cambers

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
a little nervous about the off cambers

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.660 
a little nervous about the off cambers
situations<00:02:29.530> it's<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.890> lot<00:02:30.069> taller<00:02:30.310> than<00:02:30.580> our

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
situations it's a lot taller than our

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.610 
situations it's a lot taller than our
right<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.660> used<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.019> think<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.319> one

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
right there and I used to think that one

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.339 
right there and I used to think that one
was<00:02:32.739> really<00:02:32.950> big<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:34.019> anyways<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.110> think<00:02:35.200> it

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
was really big but anyways I think it

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.630 
was really big but anyways I think it
came<00:02:35.530> out<00:02:35.650> pretty<00:02:35.709> cool<00:02:36.099> so<00:02:36.220> no<00:02:36.340> need<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.550> do

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
came out pretty cool so no need to do

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.120 
came out pretty cool so no need to do
the<00:02:36.730> bumpers<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.360> sliders<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.319> do<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
the bumpers the sliders and do the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.750 
the bumpers the sliders and do the
compressor<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.910> air<00:02:40.060> lockers<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:42.250> it's

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
compressor for the air lockers but it's

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.240 
compressor for the air lockers but it's
drivable<00:02:43.269> now<00:02:43.569> and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.510 

that<00:02:48.940> pretty<00:02:49.150> cool<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.360> think<00:02:50.520> thirty-sevens

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
that pretty cool I think thirty-sevens

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.150 
that pretty cool I think thirty-sevens
would<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.840> seem<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.080> big

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.220

the numerical hood somebody existing

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.500 
the numerical hood somebody existing
right<00:02:59.380> there<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.910> then<00:03:01.060> you've<00:03:01.180> got<00:03:01.330> this

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
right there and then you've got this

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.100 
right there and then you've got this
first<00:03:01.810> pipe<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.230> goes<00:03:02.260> down<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.920> muffler
