00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends today I bring you a trick of 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.529
 magic with cards that is prediction and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 that with a little skill and memory 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.240
 I'm sure you can surprise your 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.460
 good friends for this trick we are going to 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.440
 need a piece of paper and a 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 pen 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.190
 well the first thing we will do is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.880
 hand the deck to the viewer for 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.880
 that mix 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.340
 and once mixed we will make a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.680
 extension of letters telling the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 viewer who has mixed correctly 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.239
 but this will serve us to observe 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.550
 the first three letters we have in 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.579
 our deck in this case we have the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.540
 three of hearts eight of diamonds and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.460
 king of clubs we pick up our deck 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.040
 and we will tell the viewer that 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.360
 We are ready to give our 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.000
 prediction we take our paper and 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.550
 ballpoint pen and let's record our 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 Let's first write the letter 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.570
 that was in the middle that in my 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.730
 case was 8 diamonds after can 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 be any other letter 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.840
 the other two does not matter order three 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.250
 of hearts and king 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.250
 of clubs 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.609
 this is without the viewer seeing it 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.609
 we fold our paper 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.510
 and we give it to the viewer well to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.660
 then we take our deck of 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.840
 cards and put him on the table 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.659
 let's ask the viewer to cut 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.610
 approximately one third of the deck 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.780
 suppose the viewer cuts through 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.170
 here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.510
 well and now by way of laughter or humor 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.690
 let's tell him he has taken many 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.180
 letters so we take a letter that is 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.729
 one of the prediction letters placing it 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.430
 in the other pile you start to laugh 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.130
 so that the viewer does not suspect anything 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.869
 and just think it's a game 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.420
 you take the pile that the spectator left 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.510
 and you turn it over by placing it on 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.660
 our deck you tell the spectator and 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.170
 stress that you could know 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.500
 predicted this letter but no it is not 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.709
 so we continue to ask again 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.200
 that cut in half or below the 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.280
 half 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.540
 the spectator cuts you take the pile and you 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.360
 turn around again placing it on 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.269
 the mallet you emphasize again 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.750
 viewer that you could have said this 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.209
 letter but neither is it so please 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.120
 you ask the viewer to lift the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 mallet and find where you 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.909
 find the two back cards 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.799
 in this case it would be here and that this 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.810
 pile it on the table that you take 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.800
 the first letter that is in the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.590
 deck of cards 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.660
 and let the rest of the deck place it 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.910
 next to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.580
 Now you are going to tell him that this is your 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.440
 prediction letter what you are going to do is 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.280
 turn it around 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.990
 and you're going to ask you open the paper the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.510
 viewer is going to open the paper and we're going 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.020
 to say that there are three letters and you are going 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.600
 to say that if I do not join you and two others 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.520
 in case I was wrong then in that 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.520
 moment you raise the other two cards 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.270
 you can finish the trick hello friends 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.820
