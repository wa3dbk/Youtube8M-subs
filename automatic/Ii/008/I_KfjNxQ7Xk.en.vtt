00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.900
 today we will prepare a dish which 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.700
 is one of the symbols of Russia to any 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.680
 a foreigner who does not even know Russian 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.270
 the language is enough to pronounce only the words 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.730
 hodgepodge so as not to starve or 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.710
 stay full with you chef and fedima 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.690
 hello today we will cook with 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.410
 you hodgepodge but do not just fish and 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.140
 meat 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.650
 and for this we need onions sausages 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.390
 lemon tomato paste olives and capers 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.770
 pickles and meat proper on 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.100
 this bone can be beef or 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.440
 pork principle doesn't matter 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 the basis of any solyanka is strong 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.510
 rich broth with it and start 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.000
 in order to 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.250
 for the delicious meat broth needed 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.880
 throw cold water what am i 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 now 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.280
 and do 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.900
 the broth will boil for about 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.940
 hours during this time we will prepare 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.500
 the remaining ingredients start of course 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.780
 piled cucumbers and how can 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.410
 chop finely with a knife I prefer 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.280
 grate on a coarse grater to 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.540
 nineteenth century this dish was called 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 villager 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.270
 or from the 20th century it began to be called 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.760
 hodgepodge an opportunity for being in it 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.550
 huge amount of salty ingredients 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.570
 such as pickles olives capers 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.640
 salted olives exist 3 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.640
 varieties of the local actually which 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.320
 we are now cooking fish and simple 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 which is usually cooked either on 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.720
 hryvnia or vegetable broth 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.460
 there really is another kind of solyanka 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 but cooking has nothing to do 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.340
 this street is a hodgepodge which is in 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.560
 Moscow 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.300
 although how to say is irrelevant 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.470
 Cooking used to be fish 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.900
 salt factory where fish salt cucumbers 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.509
 rubbed now we shift cucumbers to 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.440
 separate pot and let them up 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.979
 That moment while us cucumbers does not conduct 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.979
 acid smell 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.039
 look formed foam i need 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.819
 immediately remove from here it's clean 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.819
 cholesterol 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.830
 if you have time to remove the foam you 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.830
 Buyan will remain almost transparent 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.610
 Now let 's do the onions 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.120
 we will cut it into sticks of fine ceramics 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.120
 samus 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.489
 Ninos 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.640
 and the song is now shifting the bow to 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.640
 pan 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.330
 broth boils and now add it 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.330
 brines under oil 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.750
 Incidentally analogy can be made with just about 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.140
 Someone who cook on cucumber 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.760
 brine or cabbage soup with sauerkraut 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.870
 who own face on brine 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.870
 from under the cabbage 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.239
 back to our 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.730
 as if they were picked out of cucumbers 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.000
 acid is enough just to sharpen porn 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.000
 myself 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.560
 no garden phages 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.510
 didn't go right and until the acid went away 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.730
 let's do tomato palp fried onion 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.330
 now you need to add to it 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.400
 tomato paste 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.680
 By the way the taste of saltwort dramatically 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.230
 changed with the appearance of tomatoes in Russia 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.200
 as food but it just happened 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.780
 mid-19th century before when 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.860
 Catherine second tomatoes used as 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.590
 ornamental plant 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.359
 they were just put on the windowsill for 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.680
 so that the onions do not burn there again 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.680
 add some broth 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.469
 tomato readiness can be defined as 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.319
 the same way as the readiness of cucumbers then 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:39.330
 there is on launch if the acid is still 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.840
 present then you still have cheese and meat 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.169
 already boiled enough throughout 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.520
 visibility until ready and now it 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.650
 get in order to then 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.650
 subsequently cut 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.070
 the meat must cool and we will 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.500
 sausages by the way for me still 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.290
 great mystery why all children love so much 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.590
 eat sausages or meat or pasta and 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:21.400
 Precisely sausage savior we cut 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:24.360
 little rings and now the same circles 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.360
 cut olives 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.110
 the amazing thing because I, as presented 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.610
 the cook understands what is being done 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.210
 Russian but abandon them 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.059
 of use 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.719
 just cant school memories 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.789
 dining room 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.620
 and canteens eat when stew 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.430
 cabbage was served in such chunks 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:53.039
 sausages it was called a hodgepodge 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.039
 and now roll the sausage broth 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.370
 there from 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.370
 dub salty braised cucumbers 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.599
 and send the same passaged bow with 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.599
 tomato paste 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.090
 and it remains the case for the small add meat 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.830
 pre-separating it from the bones 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.600
 when working with bones instead 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.380
 ceramic knife is better to take a knife with 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.380
 metal lisa 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.560
 meat cut into small cubes 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.810
 if you have pieces in the fridge 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.160
 pork tongue very well also 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.160
 add them to this soup 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:04.020
 Now you can add capers and 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.020
 bay leaf for taste 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.340
 and when all the ingredients are already 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.620
 three can 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.100
 shoes on salt if necessary 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.100
 dosolit 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.780
 enough 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.780
 now you can put soup on the plates 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:42.860
 and now to heighten the flavor and taste of 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.860
 a slice of lemon and a spoonful of sour cream 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.100
 In fact, the dish can perfectly replace 

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.889
 both first and second and third 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.960
 but it is best eaten in the morning especially 

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:58.400
 after a good holiday good 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.290
 feast good revel 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.610
 with you was the chef Alexey smoke up 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.610
 new meetings good morning
