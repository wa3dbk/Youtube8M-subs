is<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.980> stretching<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.549> soleus<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> so

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
is on stretching the soleus now the so

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
is on stretching the soleus now the so
this<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.049> lower<00:00:16.350> calf<00:00:16.920> muscle<00:00:17.400> goes

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
this is this lower calf muscle goes

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.730 
this is this lower calf muscle goes
underneath<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.810> one<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.199> looks<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.560> big

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
underneath this one that looks so big

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
underneath this one that looks so big
but<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.310> actually<00:00:20.640> bigger<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
but this one is actually bigger and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.200 
but this one is actually bigger and
attaches<00:00:22.050> inside<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> knee<00:00:23.340> alright<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
attaches inside of the knee alright and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.560 
attaches inside of the knee alright and
its<00:00:24.600> primary<00:00:25.109> job<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.220> straighten<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.330> toe

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
its primary job is to straighten the toe

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.169 
its primary job is to straighten the toe
and<00:00:27.930> when<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.710> run<00:00:29.010> its<00:00:29.340> primary<00:00:29.820> job<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and when we run its primary job is to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
and when we run its primary job is to
hold<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> ankle<00:00:31.050> stiff<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> ankle

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hold the ankle stiff so that the ankle

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
hold the ankle stiff so that the ankle
serves<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> spring<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.290> can

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
serves as a spring of which we can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.430 
serves as a spring of which we can
launch<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.110> stretching<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
launch all right and stretching the so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.080 
launch all right and stretching the so
dias<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> very<00:00:37.980> very<00:00:38.219> important<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
dias is very very important because the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
dias is very very important because the
more<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.390> run<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.960> especially<00:00:40.559> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
more we run and especially for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.500 
more we run and especially for
triathletes<00:00:41.399> should<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> kicking

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
triathletes should do a lot of kicking

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
triathletes should do a lot of kicking
with<00:00:42.660> their<00:00:42.780> foot<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> straight<00:00:43.649> fashion

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
with their foot in the straight fashion

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.160 
with their foot in the straight fashion
this<00:00:44.730> muscle<00:00:45.149> gets<00:00:45.329> shortened<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> we

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
this muscle gets shortened up and we

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
this muscle gets shortened up and we
really<00:00:46.500> need<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.039> quite<00:00:47.309> effective<00:00:47.430> in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
really need it to be quite effective in

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
really need it to be quite effective in
fact<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> soleus<00:00:48.930> needs<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.710> loose<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
fact the soleus needs to be so loose so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
fact the soleus needs to be so loose so
we<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.460> able<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> sit<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.750> our<00:00:52.020> haunches

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
we are able to sit down on our haunches

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
we are able to sit down on our haunches
like<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.980> without<00:00:53.579> falling<00:00:54.149> over<00:00:54.239> backwards

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
like this without falling over backwards

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
like this without falling over backwards
with<00:00:54.989> our<00:00:55.260> heel<00:00:55.649> still<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> ground<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
with our heel still on the ground and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
with our heel still on the ground and
that's<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.210> important<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.530> also<00:00:58.680> want

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that's very important but we also want

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
that's very important but we also want
to<00:00:59.010> stretch<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.340> actively<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.390> can

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
to stretch it actively because we can

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750 
to stretch it actively because we can
put<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.840> Achilles<00:01:01.230> tendon<00:01:01.680> both<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.399> terms<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
put the Achilles tendon both in terms of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.660 
put the Achilles tendon both in terms of
it's<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.830> attachment<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> heel<00:01:05.400> or

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's a it's a attachment to the heel or

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's a it's a attachment to the heel or
its<00:01:05.880> insertion<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.900> its<00:01:07.439> origin<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
its insertion and its origin on the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
its insertion and its origin on the
soleus<00:01:08.610> muscle<00:01:09.060> both<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> those<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.990> put

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
soleus muscle both of those can be put

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.350 
soleus muscle both of those can be put
under<00:01:10.380> pressure<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.100> stretch<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> muscle

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
under pressure if we stretch that muscle

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
under pressure if we stretch that muscle
passively<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.200> other<00:01:13.320> words<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.890> here

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
passively in other words we get up here

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
passively in other words we get up here
and<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.729> wail<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.630> hard<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.080> can

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and we just wail on it as hard as we can

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.859 
and we just wail on it as hard as we can
the<00:01:17.100> other<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> remember<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.659> want

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the other thing to remember if we want

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
the other thing to remember if we want
to<00:01:18.930> stretch<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> soleus<00:01:19.680> exclusively<00:01:20.640> we

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to stretch the soleus exclusively we

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.539 
to stretch the soleus exclusively we
have<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> bent<00:01:22.350> knee<00:01:22.619> all

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
have to do that with a bent knee all

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.179 
have to do that with a bent knee all
right<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.150> doing<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.990> mostly<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> gastroc

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
right so doing this is mostly a gastroc

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.179 
right so doing this is mostly a gastroc
stretch<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.210> soleus<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.080> put<00:01:28.380> under<00:01:28.500> much

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
stretch the soleus is not put under much

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.100 
stretch the soleus is not put under much
of<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.460> load<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.939> position<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.960> will

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
of a load in this position and we will

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
of a load in this position and we will
feel<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> sensation<00:01:32.070> somewhere<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.939> or

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
feel the sensation somewhere up here or

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050 
feel the sensation somewhere up here or
in<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.930> muscle<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> top<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> first

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
in this muscle at the top so the first

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.190 
in this muscle at the top so the first
thing<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> remember<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thing we have to remember with the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
thing we have to remember with the
soleus<00:01:37.560> muscle<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
soleus muscle is that we need to do that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
soleus muscle is that we need to do that
stretch<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> bent<00:01:39.869> knee<00:01:40.110> you'll<00:01:40.890> also

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
stretch with a bent knee you'll also

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.000 
position I'm keeping that knee locked
alright<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.750> once<00:02:18.959> I've<00:02:19.110> activated<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.800> four

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
alright so once I've activated it four

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
or five times I get into the same

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.960 
or five times I get into the same
position<00:02:22.080> again<00:02:22.590> bent<00:02:22.890> knee<00:02:23.130> toe<00:02:23.580> pointing

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
position again bent knee toe pointing

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.510 
position again bent knee toe pointing
straight<00:02:24.120> forward<00:02:24.239> lift<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.380> leg<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.890> all

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
straight forward lift this leg up all

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.050 
straight forward lift this leg up all
right<00:02:26.700> drive<00:02:27.390> upwards<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.380> imply<00:02:29.190> immense

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
right drive upwards now I imply immense

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.760 
right drive upwards now I imply immense
pressure<00:02:30.450> because<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:30.989> such<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.319> strong

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
pressure because that's such a strong

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.500 
pressure because that's such a strong
muscle<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.340> about<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.970> second<00:02:33.330> strongest

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
muscle it's about the second strongest

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
muscle it's about the second strongest
muscle<00:02:33.989> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> body<00:02:34.230> push<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.130> hard<00:02:35.160> as<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.640> can

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
muscle in the body push as hard as I can

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.170 
muscle in the body push as hard as I can
and<00:02:36.330> then<00:02:36.930> let<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.470> muscle<00:02:38.010> lower<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.940> heel

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and then let that muscle lower the heel

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.059 
and then let that muscle lower the heel
to<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> ground<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.380> will<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.680> feel<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
to the ground and I will now feel the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.130 
to the ground and I will now feel the
belly<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> muscle<00:02:41.880> starting<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> release

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
belly of the muscle starting to release

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.830 
belly of the muscle starting to release
and<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.800> good<00:02:44.160> active<00:02:45.090> way<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> stretch

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
and that's a good active way to stretch

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.660 
and that's a good active way to stretch
the<00:02:46.080> soleus<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.650> you'll<00:02:47.130> do<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.400> about

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
the soleus and you'll do this about

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.570 
the soleus and you'll do this about
three<00:02:47.970> times<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.720> again<00:02:49.050> front<00:02:49.680> foot<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.040> knee

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
three times so again front foot up knee

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.410 
three times so again front foot up knee
bent<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.209> locked<00:02:51.900> head<00:02:52.739> up<00:02:52.950> drive<00:02:53.880> upwards

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.100 
bent and locked head up drive upwards
really<00:02:55.200> push<00:02:55.470> very<00:02:55.739> hard<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.660> slowly<00:02:57.660> lower

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
really push very hard and slowly lower

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.350 
really push very hard and slowly lower
that<00:02:58.290> heel<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> ground<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.940> can<00:03:00.120> feel

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
that heel to the ground and you can feel

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.809 
that heel to the ground and you can feel
the<00:03:00.569> belly<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> muscle<00:03:01.400> releasing<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.760> you

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
the belly of the muscle releasing so you

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.479 
the belly of the muscle releasing so you
have<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.110> lengthening<00:03:04.110> sensation<00:03:04.769> going<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.280> in
