scenes<00:01:52.530> had<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.950> changed<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.790> we

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
scenes had to be changed so that we

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
scenes had to be changed so that we
didn't<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.600> much<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.049> originally

intended let shark and with that John
Williams<00:01:58.020> score<00:01:58.200> added<00:01:58.920> more<00:01:59.130> tension<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
Williams score added more tension to the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.060 
Williams score added more tension to the
film<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> subsequently<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.649> got<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> better

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
film and subsequently we got a better

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.459 
film and subsequently we got a better
final<00:02:02.430> product<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.329> saying<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.840> what

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
final product so what I'm saying is what

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.639 
final product so what I'm saying is what
I've<00:02:04.680> always<00:02:04.979> been<00:02:05.430> saying<00:02:05.790> less<00:02:06.509> sharks<00:02:07.469> in

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
I've always been saying less sharks in

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.100 
I've always been saying less sharks in
the<00:02:07.890> Marvel<00:02:08.280> Cinematic<00:02:08.310> Universe<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.959> we

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe I think we

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe I think we
can<00:02:10.259> all<00:02:10.410> agree<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.670> I'm<00:02:11.760> also

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
can all agree on that but what I'm also

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520 
can all agree on that but what I'm also
saying<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> return<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
saying is that the return of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
saying is that the return of
spider-man<00:02:13.920> could<00:02:14.459> change<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> MCU<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
spider-man could change the MCU for the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.690 
spider-man could change the MCU for the
worse<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.410> large<00:02:16.620> bulk<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> focus<00:02:17.490> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
worse if a large bulk of the focus is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.580 
worse if a large bulk of the focus is

new properties which seemed infinitely

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.440 
new properties which seemed infinitely
more<00:02:50.010> interesting<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.880> course<00:02:51.060> no<00:02:51.239> this

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
more interesting and of course no this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.490 
more interesting and of course no this
isn't<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> end<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.080> world

isn't the end of the world
these<00:02:52.739> movies<00:02:53.100> are<00:02:53.130> still<00:02:53.550> happening<00:02:54.030> but

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
these movies are still happening but

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.580 
these movies are still happening but
spider-man<00:02:54.660> shouldn't<00:02:55.110> take<00:02:55.260> priority

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
spider-man shouldn't take priority

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.040 
spider-man shouldn't take priority
because<00:02:56.070> frankly<00:02:56.580> he<00:02:57.120> doesn't<00:02:57.630> deserve<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
because frankly he doesn't deserve it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.600 
because frankly he doesn't deserve it
not<00:02:58.470> only<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:59.069> looks<00:02:59.250> as<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.430> they're

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
not only that it looks as if they're

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.640 
not only that it looks as if they're
going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> shoehorn<00:03:00.030> him<00:03:00.420> into<00:03:00.780> civil<00:03:01.140> war<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
going to shoehorn him into civil war and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.979 
going to shoehorn him into civil war and
I<00:03:01.890> know<00:03:01.950> he<00:03:02.400> plays<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.670> pivotal<00:03:02.940> role<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.420> that

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
I know he plays a pivotal role in that

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.960 
I know he plays a pivotal role in that
storyline<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.250> movie<00:03:05.580> was<00:03:05.610> initially

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
storyline but this movie was initially

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.550 
storyline but this movie was initially
planned<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.690> be<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> launching<00:03:07.410> off<00:03:07.530> point

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
planned to be the launching off point

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.680 
planned to be the launching off point
for<00:03:08.100> Black<00:03:08.280> Panther<00:03:08.850> which<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.300> probably

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
for Black Panther which it probably

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.430 
for Black Panther which it probably
still<00:03:09.959> will<00:03:10.200> be

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
still will be

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.680 
still will be
but<00:03:10.800> again<00:03:11.190> that's<00:03:12.060> an<00:03:12.269> interesting

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
but again that's an interesting

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.900 
but again that's an interesting
character<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:13.709> haven't<00:03:14.100> seen<00:03:14.370> yet<00:03:14.430> not

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
character that we haven't seen yet not

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.979 
character that we haven't seen yet not
only<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> official<00:03:15.720> announcement

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
only that the official announcement

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.930 
only that the official announcement
makes<00:03:16.470> mention<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.920> Peter<00:03:17.160> Parker<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.880> know

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
makes mention of Peter Parker and I know

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.759 
makes mention of Peter Parker and I know
Peter<00:03:18.299> Parker<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.750> spider-man<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.560> that's

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
Peter Parker is spider-man and that's

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.860 
Peter Parker is spider-man and that's
great<00:03:20.160> good<00:03:20.790> for<00:03:21.060> him<00:03:21.269> but<00:03:21.600> if<00:03:21.720> we're<00:03:21.810> gonna

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
great good for him but if we're gonna
