00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
line at the most you'll be having air

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.920 
line at the most you'll be having air
leaks<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> stranded<00:00:32.040> somewhere<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.930> always

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
yeah I wanted to show you the compressor

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.840

brackets<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> made<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> sucker<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
brackets that I made for this sucker it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
brackets that I made for this sucker it
holds<00:00:48.500> two<00:00:49.500> fire<00:00:49.860> four<00:00:50.340> 80s<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.940> each<00:00:51.090> side

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.990 

welded<00:00:59.440> along<00:00:59.710> top<00:01:00.100> there<00:01:00.309> along<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.609> side

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
welded along top there along the side

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.939 
welded along top there along the side
and<00:01:01.030> along<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.809> bottom<00:01:01.929> of<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.379> frame<00:01:02.649> and

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
and along the bottom of the frame and

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.740 
and along the bottom of the frame and
then<00:01:03.280> those<00:01:03.579> brackets<00:01:03.879> go<00:01:04.299> all<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.720> way

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
then those brackets go all the way

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.460 
then those brackets go all the way
underneath<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:06.009> main<00:01:06.220> plate<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:08.350> they

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
underneath the main plate where they

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.050 
underneath the main plate where they
each<00:01:08.649> sit<00:01:10.259> so<00:01:11.259> in<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> end<00:01:14.310> looks<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:15.549> that

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
each sit so in the end looks like that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.179 
each sit so in the end looks like that
tucked<00:01:16.299> right<00:01:16.450> behind<00:01:16.960> there<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:19.920> also<00:01:20.920> for

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
tucked right behind there and also for

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.800 
tucked right behind there and also for
each<00:01:21.250> side<00:01:23.759> since<00:01:24.759> we<00:01:24.850> don't<00:01:25.000> want<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.360> bunch<00:01:25.600> of

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
each side since we don't want a bunch of

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.630 
each side since we don't want a bunch of
dirt<00:01:26.200> just<00:01:26.500> pulling<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.100> up<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.430> hitting

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
dirt just pulling it up and hitting

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.550 
dirt just pulling it up and hitting
those<00:01:27.880> compressors<00:01:28.300> we<00:01:29.140> went<00:01:29.319> ahead<00:01:29.380> and

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
those compressors we went ahead and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.700 
those compressors we went ahead and
built<00:01:29.740> some<00:01:30.220> some<00:01:31.149> mud<00:01:31.360> flaps<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.380> metal

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
built some some mud flaps to the metal

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.139 
built some some mud flaps to the metal
mud<00:01:32.890> flaps<00:01:33.190> they<00:01:33.520> bolt<00:01:33.789> right<00:01:34.119> up<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.509> there<00:01:39.149> so

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
mud flaps they bolt right up in there so

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.730 
mud flaps they bolt right up in there so
you<00:01:40.299> got<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.600> extra<00:01:40.990> piece<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.289> metal<00:01:41.530> coming

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you got that extra piece of metal coming

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.050 
you got that extra piece of metal coming
down<00:01:42.039> that<00:01:42.610> mounts<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.209> bumper<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.759> to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
down that mounts to the bumper and to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.300 
down that mounts to the bumper and to
this<00:01:46.209> piece<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:47.229> then<00:01:47.679> there's<00:01:48.009> three

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
this piece and then there's three

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.249 
this piece and then there's three
mounting<00:01:48.700> points<00:01:49.119> up<00:01:49.299> along<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.780> top<00:01:49.990> there

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
mounting points up along the top there

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.690 
mounting points up along the top there
so<00:01:51.330> how<00:01:52.330> to<00:01:52.390> block<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.929> all<00:01:53.049> nice<00:01:53.429> cut<00:01:54.429> around

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
so how to block it all nice cut around

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.449 
so how to block it all nice cut around
the<00:01:54.819> frame<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.470> it's<00:01:56.709> not<00:01:56.860> rubbing<00:01:57.280> on<00:01:57.399> the

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
the frame so it's not rubbing on the

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.840 
the frame so it's not rubbing on the
frame<00:01:57.490> or<00:01:57.940> anything<00:01:59.039> just<00:02:00.039> got<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.219> spray<00:02:00.549> paint

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
frame or anything just got a spray paint

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.760 
frame or anything just got a spray paint
over<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.570> that'll<00:02:01.869> be<00:02:01.930> like<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.259> last<00:02:02.439> piece

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
over and that'll be like the last piece

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.499 
over and that'll be like the last piece
I<00:02:02.920> put<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.280> that's<00:02:03.549> just<00:02:03.609> the<00:02:03.850> base<00:02:04.060> plate<00:02:06.509> it

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
I put on that's just the base plate it

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.349 
I put on that's just the base plate it
took<00:02:07.780> these<00:02:08.609> massive<00:02:09.609> three-quarter<00:02:10.209> inch

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.359 
took these massive three-quarter inch

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.630 
took these massive three-quarter inch
lines<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.350> was<00:02:11.500> talking<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.250> about<00:02:12.310> in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
lines and I was talking to you about in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.729 
lines and I was talking to you about in

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
the last couple videos and they're ran

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.949 
the last couple videos and they're ran
down<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.220> here<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.120> from<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:16.600> I'm

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
going to plumb in both of these lines so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.410 
going to plumb in both of these lines so
this<00:02:19.959> sucker<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.470> gonna<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.790> compressing

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
this sucker is gonna be not compressing

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.509 
this sucker is gonna be not compressing
the<00:02:22.540> air<00:02:22.720> at<00:02:22.930> all<00:02:23.109> in<00:02:23.560> those<00:02:23.920> lines<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.489> should

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
the air at all in those lines it should

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.930
