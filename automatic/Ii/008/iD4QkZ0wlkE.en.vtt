this car is not for everybody this is
the<00:00:05.100> extreme<00:00:05.640> example<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.779> performance

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
the extreme example of the performance

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.520 
the extreme example of the performance
muscle<00:00:07.649> cars<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> car<00:00:09.090> like<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.570> not

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
muscle cars you do a car like this not

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.669 
muscle cars you do a car like this not
to<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.269> you<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> car<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.320> send

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
to be so you do a car like this to send

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.829 
to be so you do a car like this to send
a<00:00:13.830> message<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> industry<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.179> who<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.630> are

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.280 

the<00:00:26.880> first<00:00:27.180> thing<00:00:27.450> that<00:00:27.480> makes<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.930> hellcat

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
the first thing that makes the hellcat

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.370 
the first thing that makes the hellcat
so<00:00:28.500> special<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.730> most<00:00:30.330> obvious<00:00:30.630> thing<00:00:30.870> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
so special is the most obvious thing is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.890 
so special is the most obvious thing is
a<00:00:31.440> supercharged<00:00:32.099> end<00:00:32.279> we've<00:00:32.550> never<00:00:33.030> offered<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
a supercharged end we've never offered a

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.950 
a supercharged end we've never offered a
factory<00:00:34.710> supercharged<00:00:35.520> Hemi<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.270> mean<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
factory supercharged Hemi I mean this is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960 
factory supercharged Hemi I mean this is
the<00:00:37.110> ultimate<00:00:37.320> performance<00:00:38.100> being<00:00:38.580> the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
the ultimate performance being the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.120 
the ultimate performance being the

command of power you have with your
accelerator<00:00:41.760> foot<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.270> unbelievable<00:00:43.170> I've

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
accelerator foot is unbelievable I've

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
accelerator foot is unbelievable I've
never<00:00:43.830> driven<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.520> car<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.940> has<00:00:45.090> this

never driven a car that has this

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.049 
never driven a car that has this
performance<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.680> started<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> 392<00:00:48.030> Hemi

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.350 
performance we started with a 392 Hemi
and<00:00:48.600> upgraded<00:00:49.500> over<00:00:49.620> 90%<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> components

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and upgraded over 90% of the components

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180
