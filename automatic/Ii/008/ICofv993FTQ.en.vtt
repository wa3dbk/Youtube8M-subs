running around in this video with the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
running around in this video with the

spass kind of just clowning around doing
my<00:00:29.789> normal<00:00:29.849> thing<00:00:30.179> where<00:00:30.390> did<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.900> guy<00:00:31.109> come

my normal thing where did that guy come
from<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:31.830> he<00:00:31.920> must<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> gotten<00:00:32.369> revived

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
from I think he must have gotten revived

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.709 
from I think he must have gotten revived
because<00:00:32.969> he<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.210> popped<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.600> nowhere

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

but I hadn't played nose hair canals and
I<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> while<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:37.829> like

posting a lot of tedium on this

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.750 
posting a lot of tedium on this
particular<00:00:40.230> map<00:00:40.739> because<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.040> seems<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.370> we

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
particular map because it seems like we

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
particular map because it seems like we
do<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> games<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.930> nose<00:00:43.140> hair

do get a lot of games on nose hair
canals<00:00:43.649> TDM<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.399> since<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> shotgun

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
canals TDM but since this is shotgun

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.400 
canals TDM but since this is shotgun
gameplay<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> thought<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.230> pretty

in<00:01:50.130> its<00:01:50.579> core<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.689> any<00:01:52.110> different<00:01:52.290> than

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
in its core it's not any different than

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
in its core it's not any different than
like<00:01:53.220> let's<00:01:53.880> say<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.659> normal

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the battlefield but one of the things I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
the battlefield but one of the things I
actually<00:02:02.219> found<00:02:02.490> pretty<00:02:02.820> interesting<00:02:03.450> about

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
actually found pretty interesting about

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.109 
actually found pretty interesting about
the<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.860> trailer<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.340> they<00:02:05.460> basically<00:02:05.640> said

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the the trailer is they basically said

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.520 
the the trailer is they basically said
that<00:02:06.240> you're<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.750> limited<00:02:07.170> ammo

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that you're going to have limited ammo

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.960 
that you're going to have limited ammo
once<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.950> find<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.310> weapon<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.819> you're

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
once you find that weapon so you're

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.150 
once you find that weapon so you're
always<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> hunt<00:02:10.259> even<00:02:11.069> if

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
always going to be on the hunt even if

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.220 
always going to be on the hunt even if
you<00:02:11.250> say<00:02:11.459> let's<00:02:11.730> say<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:11.970> pick<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.450> pkp<00:02:12.989> with

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you say let's say you pick up a pkp with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.670 
you say let's say you pick up a pkp with
a<00:02:13.260> pipe

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
a pipe

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
a pipe
and<00:02:13.950> you've<00:02:14.099> ipod<00:02:14.519> up<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:15.209> probably<00:02:15.239> only

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
and you've ipod up you're probably only

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.929 
and you've ipod up you're probably only
going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.019> have<00:02:16.260> about<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.829> know<00:02:16.950> 75<00:02:17.459> rounds

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
going to have about you know 75 rounds

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.229 
going to have about you know 75 rounds
maybe<00:02:18.890> 11<00:02:19.890> little<00:02:20.189> belt<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.000> ammunition

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
maybe 11 little belt of ammunition

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.390 
maybe 11 little belt of ammunition
before<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.409> move<00:02:22.859> on<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.040> try<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
before you have to move on and try to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.580 
before you have to move on and try to
find<00:02:23.549> another<00:02:23.819> weapon<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.719> think<00:02:25.439> that's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
find another weapon so I think that's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.050 
find another weapon so I think that's
really<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.040> change<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.519> pacing<00:02:26.909> in<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
really going to change the pacing in the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.880 
really going to change the pacing in the
game<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:27.510> I'm<00:02:27.599> actually<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.439> excited

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
game and I'm actually kind of excited

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.470 
game and I'm actually kind of excited
for<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.430> think<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.209> going<00:02:30.359> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
for that I think that it's going to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.780 
for that I think that it's going to
bring<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.079> pretty<00:02:31.290> cool<00:02:31.469> dynamic<00:02:32.010> now<00:02:32.159> in<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
bring a pretty cool dynamic now in the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
bring a pretty cool dynamic now in the
past<00:02:33.030> I've<00:02:33.329> been<00:02:33.359> pretty<00:02:33.689> skeptical<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.500> lot<00:02:34.799> of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
past I've been pretty skeptical a lot of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.649 
past I've been pretty skeptical a lot of
new<00:02:35.010> game<00:02:35.250> modes<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.609> battlefield<00:02:36.090> 3<00:02:36.150> just

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
new game modes in battlefield 3 just

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.809 
new game modes in battlefield 3 just
because<00:02:37.019> first<00:02:37.650> they<00:02:37.859> haven't<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:38.609> been

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
because first they haven't really been

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.099 
because first they haven't really been
that<00:02:39.000> great<00:02:39.180> i<00:02:39.269> mean<00:02:39.389> conquest<00:02:39.959> domination

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
that great i mean conquest domination

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.319 
that great i mean conquest domination
was<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.769> over<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.099> place<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.609> we<00:02:41.760> got<00:02:42.000> what

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
was all over the place then we got what

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.330 
was all over the place then we got what
gun<00:02:42.840> game<00:02:43.109> or<00:02:43.379> whatever<00:02:43.469> it's<00:02:43.799> called<00:02:43.859> in<00:02:44.189> this

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
gun game or whatever it's called in this

gun game or whatever it's called in this
gun<00:02:44.639> master<00:02:45.079> and<00:02:46.079> they<00:02:46.200> didn't<00:02:46.409> give<00:02:46.530> us<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
gun master and they didn't give us the

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.319 
gun master and they didn't give us the
ability<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:47.220> customize<00:02:47.760> stuff<00:02:48.000> they<00:02:48.120> put<00:02:48.150> a

ability to customize stuff they put a

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.119 
ability to customize stuff they put a
lot<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.659> stupid<00:02:48.989> weapons<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:49.859> wasn't

mean<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.540> seems<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.019> game<00:02:55.590> mode<00:02:55.859> is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
mean it seems like that game mode is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.729 
mean it seems like that game mode is
just<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.519> very<00:02:56.730> popular<00:02:57.030> whatsoever<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
just not very popular whatsoever so you

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.409 
just not very popular whatsoever so you
don't<00:02:58.889> see<00:02:59.129> me<00:02:59.280> play<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.669> too<00:02:59.909> often<00:03:00.120> just

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
don't see me play that too often just

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.940 
don't see me play that too often just
because<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.659> wasn't<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.379> wasn't<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> huge<00:03:01.919> fan

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
because I wasn't just wasn't a huge fan

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.899 
because I wasn't just wasn't a huge fan
of<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.400> mean<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.549> don't<00:03:02.579> really<00:03:02.730> have

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
of it I mean I don't really have

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.789 
of it I mean I don't really have
anything<00:03:03.150> against<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.689> but<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.500> me<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.769> just

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
anything against it but to me it just

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.949 
anything against it but to me it just
wasn't<00:03:05.310> an<00:03:05.400> exciting<00:03:05.909> game<00:03:05.939> mode<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.540> with

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
wasn't an exciting game mode now with

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.140 
wasn't an exciting game mode now with
this<00:03:07.169> though<00:03:07.469> my<00:03:08.280> interest<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.909> at<00:03:09.060> an

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
this though my interest is at an

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.270 
this though my interest is at an
all-time<00:03:09.329> high<00:03:09.599> for<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:10.230> new<00:03:10.409> dice<00:03:10.709> game<00:03:11.040> mode

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
all-time high for a new dice game mode

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.890 
all-time high for a new dice game mode
and<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.549> think<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.849> might<00:03:11.909> be<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.359> first<00:03:12.389> one

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and I think this might be the first one

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.289 
and I think this might be the first one
and<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.349> just<00:03:13.560> kind<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.459> don't<00:03:14.969> know<00:03:15.120> it's

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299

trailers<00:04:18.989> but<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.650> cool<00:04:19.859> thing<00:04:19.889> is<00:04:20.130> as<00:04:20.430> I

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
trailers but the cool thing is as I

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.920 
trailers but the cool thing is as I
mentioned<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:20.940> earlier<00:04:21.090> in<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.509> video<00:04:21.599> is

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
mentioned this earlier in the video is

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.140 
mentioned this earlier in the video is
the<00:04:22.079> limited<00:04:22.500> ammo<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:22.979> once<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:23.820> find

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
the limited ammo so once you do find

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.610 
the limited ammo so once you do find
those<00:04:24.330> weapons<00:04:24.570> you're<00:04:24.900> still<00:04:25.200> going<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.469> have

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
those weapons you're still going to have

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.670 
those weapons you're still going to have
to<00:04:25.800> constantly<00:04:26.159> move

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
to constantly move

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.290 
to constantly move
going<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.889> have<00:04:27.039> to<00:04:27.070> move<00:04:27.310> along<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:28.090> what<00:04:28.270> I

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
going to have to move along from what I

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.420 
going to have to move along from what I
can<00:04:28.419> tell<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.870> looks<00:04:29.110> like<00:04:29.320> each<00:04:29.560> pickup<00:04:30.009> comes

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
can tell it looks like each pickup comes

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.159 
can tell it looks like each pickup comes
with<00:04:30.669> about<00:04:30.880> two<00:04:31.180> magazines<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:31.930> it's<00:04:32.080> an

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
with about two magazines if it's an

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.540 
with about two magazines if it's an
assault<00:04:32.440> rifle<00:04:32.500> like<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.979> said<00:04:33.160> with<00:04:33.250> maybe

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
assault rifle like I said with maybe

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.700 
assault rifle like I said with maybe
like<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.789> pkp<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.600> think<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.139> might<00:04:35.320> get<00:04:35.560> like

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
like the pkp I think you might get like

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.710 
like the pkp I think you might get like
one<00:04:36.100> belt<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.759> that's<00:04:36.910> not<00:04:37.090> extended<00:04:37.630> so

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
one belt and that's not extended so

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.850 
one belt and that's not extended so
you're<00:04:37.870> looking<00:04:38.110> at<00:04:38.199> like<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.350> hundred<00:04:38.560> rounds

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
you're looking at like a hundred rounds

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.400 
you're looking at like a hundred rounds
before<00:04:39.160> you're<00:04:39.460> out<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:39.820> there<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.570> limit<00:04:41.110> to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
before you're out so there is a limit to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.540 
before you're out so there is a limit to
what<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.770> do<00:04:42.009> with<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.190> lot<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.430> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
what you can do with a lot of the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.680 
what you can do with a lot of the
weapons<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.000> think<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:43.360> really<00:04:43.449> going

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
weapons and I think that's really going

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.689 
weapons and I think that's really going
to<00:04:43.780> make<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.110> gameplay<00:04:44.560> play<00:04:45.160> out<00:04:45.310> very

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
to make the gameplay play out very

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.950 
to make the gameplay play out very
interesting<00:04:46.240> i<00:04:46.300> think<00:04:46.330> it's<00:04:46.570> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.810> unfold

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
interesting i think it's going to unfold

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840 
interesting i think it's going to unfold
to<00:04:47.350> be<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.470> lot<00:04:47.680> more<00:04:47.710> exciting<00:04:48.340> than<00:04:48.460> normal

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
to be a lot more exciting than normal

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.820 
to be a lot more exciting than normal
conquest<00:04:49.389> and<00:04:50.169> I'm<00:04:50.289> actually<00:04:50.440> kind<00:04:50.770> of

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
conquest and I'm actually kind of

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.140 
conquest and I'm actually kind of
intrigued<00:04:51.160> by<00:04:51.310> like<00:04:51.550> watching<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.030> that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.430 
intrigued by like watching you that
trailer<00:04:52.360> back<00:04:52.630> I've<00:04:52.780> probably<00:04:52.960> watched<00:04:53.289> it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
trailer back I've probably watched it

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.830 
trailer back I've probably watched it
like<00:04:53.560> five<00:04:53.800> six<00:04:54.130> seven<00:04:54.280> times<00:04:54.669> and<00:04:55.389> I<00:04:55.600> keep

beautiful<00:04:59.470> they<00:04:59.560> look<00:04:59.590> I<00:05:00.039> mean<00:05:00.340> there's<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.580> lot

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
beautiful they look I mean there's a lot

beautiful they look I mean there's a lot
of<00:05:00.820> staircase<00:05:01.479> type<00:05:01.840> things<00:05:02.320> where<00:05:02.560> you're

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
of staircase type things where you're

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.499 
of staircase type things where you're
doing<00:05:03.099> a<00:05:03.160> lot<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.340> level<00:05:03.699> 2<00:05:03.820> level<00:05:03.849> fighting

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
doing a lot of level 2 level fighting

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.080 
doing a lot of level 2 level fighting
that's<00:05:05.289> always<00:05:05.470> been<00:05:05.740> kind<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.009> cool<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.910> with

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
that's always been kind of cool it with

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.400 
that's always been kind of cool it with
that<00:05:07.300> was<00:05:07.570> something<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:07.930> really<00:05:08.139> expected

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
that was something I really expected

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.990 
that was something I really expected
from<00:05:08.800> close<00:05:09.009> quarters<00:05:09.400> we<00:05:09.520> didn't<00:05:09.759> end<00:05:09.880> up

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
from close quarters we didn't end up

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.460 
from close quarters we didn't end up
getting<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.389> there<00:05:10.539> wasn't<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.900> lot<00:05:11.050> of<00:05:11.169> level

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
getting that there wasn't a lot of level

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.200 
getting that there wasn't a lot of level
fighting<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:12.490> seemed<00:05:12.669> like<00:05:12.820> you<00:05:12.940> couldn't

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
fighting it seemed like you couldn't

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.430 
fighting it seemed like you couldn't
really<00:05:13.360> oh<00:05:13.479> no<00:05:13.660> that's<00:05:13.960> some<00:05:14.080> bad<00:05:14.199> shooting

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
really oh no that's some bad shooting

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.140 
really oh no that's some bad shooting
right<00:05:14.650> there<00:05:14.830> you<00:05:15.250> didn't<00:05:15.490> really<00:05:15.669> get<00:05:15.910> the

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
right there you didn't really get the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.339 
right there you didn't really get the
amount<00:05:16.449> of<00:05:16.599> Louisville<00:05:16.930> fighting<00:05:17.199> that<00:05:17.320> I

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
amount of Louisville fighting that I

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.320 
amount of Louisville fighting that I
thought<00:05:17.590> was<00:05:17.740> going<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.099> be<00:05:18.190> in<00:05:18.880> close

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
thought was going to be in close

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.300 
thought was going to be in close
quarters<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.870> mean<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.110> was<00:05:20.199> mostly<00:05:20.590> flat<00:05:20.919> you

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
quarters I mean it was mostly flat you

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.010 
quarters I mean it was mostly flat you
know<00:05:21.340> maybe<00:05:21.699> you<00:05:21.820> go<00:05:21.940> two<00:05:22.000> stories<00:05:22.479> up<00:05:22.660> but<00:05:22.870> for

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
know maybe you go two stories up but for

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.689 
know maybe you go two stories up but for
for<00:05:23.560> this<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:23.949> looks<00:05:24.130> like<00:05:24.280> there's<00:05:24.460> going<00:05:24.580> to

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
for this it looks like there's going to

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.100 
for this it looks like there's going to
be<00:05:24.759> a<00:05:24.820> little<00:05:25.150> out<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.270> chaos<00:05:25.539> there's<00:05:25.900> going

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
be a little out of chaos there's going

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.990 
be a little out of chaos there's going
to<00:05:26.169> be<00:05:26.229> a<00:05:26.289> lot<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.669> objectives<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.789> are<00:05:27.849> in

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
really have a very long shelf life I

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.850

i<00:06:59.420> mean<00:06:59.600> let's<00:07:00.290> face<00:07:00.380> it<00:07:00.680> guys<00:07:00.800> i<00:07:00.860> mean<00:07:01.130> it<00:07:01.280> it

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
i mean let's face it guys i mean it it

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.640 
i mean let's face it guys i mean it it
was<00:07:01.670> an<00:07:01.790> interesting<00:07:02.150> concept<00:07:02.930> but<00:07:03.410> it<00:07:03.530> just

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
was an interesting concept but it just

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.650 
was an interesting concept but it just
did<00:07:03.860> not<00:07:03.890> play<00:07:04.430> out<00:07:04.610> the<00:07:05.180> way<00:07:05.210> I<00:07:05.360> thought<00:07:05.480> it

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
did not play out the way I thought it

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.970 
did not play out the way I thought it
would<00:07:05.810> but<00:07:06.170> I<00:07:06.230> think<00:07:06.500> this<00:07:06.590> one<00:07:06.830> can

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
would but I think this one can

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.040 
would but I think this one can
definitely<00:07:07.430> it<00:07:07.910> can<00:07:08.090> definitely<00:07:08.450> build<00:07:08.840> a

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
definitely it can definitely build a

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.930 
definitely it can definitely build a
void<00:07:09.290> that<00:07:09.530> I<00:07:09.590> thought<00:07:09.890> gun<00:07:10.220> master<00:07:10.490> would<00:07:10.790> do

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
void that I thought gun master would do

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.610 
void that I thought gun master would do
it<00:07:11.120> should<00:07:11.360> be<00:07:11.480> more<00:07:11.660> exciting<00:07:12.170> to<00:07:12.260> be<00:07:12.440> more

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
it should be more exciting to be more

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.080 
it should be more exciting to be more
variety<00:07:13.070> in<00:07:13.100> the<00:07:13.220> weapons<00:07:13.610> and<00:07:13.700> stuff<00:07:13.910> like
