00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
 everyone comes back to him for a 

00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.190
 new video so I'm coming to you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.799
 present the very latest palette that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.040
 costa scene his output so it's the wii 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.630
 vim so I just came from the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 to receive I'm not open yet 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.279
 I'm not it either at her house is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.600
 still in its packaging that makes a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.010
 little time I wait for it since 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.109
 I will order on the site of coastal 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.369
 sense as soon as she came out and I believe 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 that it's been a little over ten days 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 arrive 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.510
 so here I have received them I got 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.800
 said I'm filming right away we know 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 they want ordered ordered know that she 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.850
 is available on the caussens website 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.770
 or then you have the opportunity to 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
 those who are impatient who are afraid 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.000
 customs fees of the order on 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 the site of what makeup you that I 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 will put the link of coastal and of what 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 make-up information anbar know 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.780
 that it cost me so 19 dollars 90 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 but with the shipping costs so I was 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.719
 believe 13 or 14 dollar know come back 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 I believe at 22 or 23 euros know that if 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.440
 you take it on the site of what but 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.940
 that you receive it in two days and that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 you exactly at the same price 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 so I should have done that except that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 the time when I ordered 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.630
 the site did not have the palette yet 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.159
 so that's all you know 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.600
 delay we will move to the palette 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.670
 so know that they had already released 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 a first edition of this palette 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.520
 which was obviously a duke pallet 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 of the year EADS 1 and year 2 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 so here we are going to see if this one is 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.640
 the double of the year he believes since 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.430
 I 'm not here yet I'm not going 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 not yet not swatch yet and so 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 that's how she shows up she's 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.570
 any flat any tray 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.979
 width level to corresponds to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.840
 that of lörrach 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.780
 see by cons she is a little bit 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.430
 smaller and longer than the lörrach 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 well, it's a palette that is very 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.759
 very very compact so perfect for 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 take her 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.299
 as reveals the one there is no 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 so I look I have no break so 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.130
 a little protective thing so like the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 one there is no mirror me perso that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.549
 do not bother me since I only use 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.810
 very rarely the pallet mirrors 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 so that's not very serious 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.549
 and that's how they present themselves 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.159
 frankly when I saw the pictures 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.930
 when I saw the release of the photos but 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.600
 I said to myself I need it so much the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.740
 a 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.590
 I have not taken them because 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.690
 I already had the year quest 1 and 2 as much 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.030
 this one I said to myself nanan that one 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.110
 I absolutely need it I'm a fan of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.569
 purple is what puts the most in 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.590
 value my green eyes so there when I 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.060
 saw this one I told myself 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.920
 imperatively I have to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 inside you have 20 blush to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.340
 eyelids that are exactly the same 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.170
 size that's what you can 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.520
 find in the pallets of urban 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.720
 which I come from every night at 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.239
 so I'll try to drag you 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.670
 swatch at the same time I'm really 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.800
 delighted there are some lighthouses that are more 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.709
 or less pigmented in any case the line 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.690
 from the bottom it's just a killing is my 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.580
 favorite is manning from the bottom line 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
 from the top and not bad the light touch is 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.630
 okay that there against a small 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.480
 disappointment since it is almost 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.220
 that glitters but that's about 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.010
 the rest is very harmonious it's 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.239
 a palette that I'm sure will put in 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.350
 value my eyes since it is composed 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.590
 brown red maroon 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.450
 a little purple and there is nude 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
 also among the twenty strong you have 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.330
 7 matt so I think it's more 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.579
 correct 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.510
 you have transition lights you 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.269
 have lighthouses with which you 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.980
 can make smoky so that's it 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.730
 it's a great palette that holds well 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.680
 in hand 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.090
 now at the level of the outfit that has me 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.070
 looks very good since I switched 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.870
 without a base and I had trouble getting them 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.310
 remove as well on my arm as on 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.810
 but you 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.250
 so here they are not specially 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.390
 very very very dusty there are 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 some who are more or less 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.700
 powdery must tap his brush 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.590
 good here is 30,19 dollars 90 did what 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.840
 from 15 euros my 22 euros with fees 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.019
 20 eyeshadow port frankly 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.220
 it's barely 1 euro the makeup 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.640
 eyelids I find that it is very 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.260
 correct 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.530
 the big question is is it 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.930
 this palette and the dew of the year that 3 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.000
 so I just came from swatch and and 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.220
 frankly when I saw the swatch 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.630
 on American videos I told myself 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.859
 but it has nothing to do with the year qe3 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.180
 especially since she did not talk about it 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.870
 especially not to say it was a 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.329
 god why 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.880
 but then I come from swatch and and very 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.700
 frankly there are a lot of lighthouses 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.920
 apart from maybe a cleat I 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.599
 will show you 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.270
 I include you she is either at the 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.340
 comparisons but here I think it 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.370
 there is only one that does not have 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.950
 really been well copied well if 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.530
 We can say it like that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.930
 here is my and then the black star because 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.260
 that the black star of the year some 3 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.510
 and a little more how to say violin 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.960
 we see a little better glitter than 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.180
 the one that is presented see what 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.919
 yeah it's a little darker actually 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.139
 the one of but hey it is very light 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.030
 so yes yes it's a very good 10 or 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.160
 little of the year qe3 so for those who 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.840
 do not want to put almost 50 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.639
 euros in the call durban indicated I 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.010
 really advise this one is 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.280
 frankly go here there is nothing to 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.960
 say 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.880
 of course I will tutor you 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.560
 with this palette there I will show you 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.120
 what that can give in terms in 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.740
 terms of make up in any case what me 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.660
 I can do it 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.790
 I think I told you everything 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.139
 I think I have everything said I make sure 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.310
 that the video does not last too much too much 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.810
 a long time because I know it 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.820
 drunk 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.620
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.720
 will have rained I make you very very very 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.050
 very big kisses and I tell you to very 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.680
 soon 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.680
 kisses lease
