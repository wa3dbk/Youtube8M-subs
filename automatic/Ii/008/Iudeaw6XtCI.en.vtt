00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello friends with you karabash 74 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.139
 today we have a little 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.740
 retreat a little bit from the rollers I wanted 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.379
 would you know in brief probably say by 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.840
 about our program that is, I have 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.900
 constantly ask that is when stream 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.869
 sometime when this is what i have now you 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580
 I will say my program, that is, I no longer 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.250
 I want you to ask me this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 kind of questions because i'm filming remember 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.510
 as far as your filming, so to speak 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 have we will go out every day 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.930
 gta5 we will go through one series in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.890
 one series per day 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 go out car mechanic simulator 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.160
 Next we have on the list spintires 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.160
 if something is new 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 accordingly, and we will look at 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.489
 About 4 games I have not thought yet, but I 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.979
 I think it will be a headlamp edge I want 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.409
 still go take it and go 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.420
 Ie either forest or headlights edge something 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.350
 like that, but it is impossible to go through the forest 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.270
 because 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.119
 storyline once you are there not 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.490
 exists at the moment that's it 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.900
 so I think that pass far cry 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 I really want that is, I have it for the most part 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.000
 the account never went to the end 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.000
 today will stream machine on your 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.369
 screens that is worth KAMAZ they evolve 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.119
 now work together in multiplayer 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.759
 there is a furcade yesterday with the boys 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.509
 tested a lot thanks i have 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 Now everything works, the link will be to these 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.170
 Kamaz evolve will then when I say 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.170
 on stream you and download install then 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 have and we start everything will be spelled out already 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.450
 by default, that is, nothing will be needed 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.450
 change just download archive 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.670
 You connect through Jesse James and we 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.069
 start playing if i throws out 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 I recruit a team of other people that is it 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.599
 mean someone did something 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.360
 wrong because of this all of us past 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.700
 once and threw out 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.490
 by and large they worked together 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.680
 because we just tested them 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.660
 just the last time someone did something 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 incorrectly hooked us all thrown out 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.240
 out of the toy but this is not the case now 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.400
 I mean I wanted to convey to you all this 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.680
 information I hope you all heard me 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.880
 we as you probably noticed now in 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.900
 group vk that is now there is more 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.230
 administrators that is, contact 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.530
 people now have small 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.370
 permutations are conducted in the scope of something 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.300
 have I got some busy with 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.560
 another appeared that is precisely why 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:03.970
 Now such changes that I wanted 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.540
 that is to say I have to write to me at 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.260
 group that is to fall into the mouth of the deed 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.860
 post 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.980
 Yes, no matter I do not need to write when 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.850
 will stream that is stream will go out 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 as far as my free 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.019
 time guys there will be time will not stream 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.720
 there will be time there will be no stream 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:34.000
 that is, I think everyone understands that 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.780
 have all the news always come out first 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.130
 in the group under to to then later 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.580
 respectively in an hour if stream 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.350
 going to do that means in an hour 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.160
 will start well, that is, the time in the groove 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.959
 post post already written that is, it is the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.250
 everybody knows a long time ago 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.709
 That's about what you write to me 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.330
 I wanted to immediately resort to the fact that you told me 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.180
 write a lot of people write to me 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.390
 in k vrk wondered why i can't 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.910
 write on stream guys banal answer 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.720
 I already answered this question but I will answer 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.320
 once again on him that is and last time 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.060
 continue writing to me, I will ban you 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.280
 will not understand something different 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.660
 I will solve this question everywhere 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.450
 ban you here think that is before 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.520
 than write something in the comments in 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.130
 comments to the video that is, you write 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.500
 banal nonsense that is all 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.190
 Comments I read everything 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 absolutely all comments 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.470
 i filter them then i have all that stuff 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.290
 which does not belong to the game I throw out 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.320
 that is, I don't need him for a long time 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.820
 said long ago that comments now 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.010
 we will filter that is all that 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.470
 related to video comments remain 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.900
 all that does not apply to the video everything goes away 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.050
 either in the ban because you are very much 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.420
 you are rude that is to dare and and you 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.570
 Naturally climb into the bank immediately 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.880
 irrevocable that is something like this 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.890
 because to negotiate with you very much 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.180
 it becomes difficult I will act 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:18.330
 start to be rude 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.210
 the second time you start to rude the bath 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.760
 for I have a stove that is all we just have 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:29.340
 now there will be a snappy ban that's all 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.530
 snapper in a boar without any 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.990

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.360
 beg me like some now me 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.190

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.500
 we live in the 21st century we are all people we are all 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.810

 I will repay you the same coin as you 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.120
