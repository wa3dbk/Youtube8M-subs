00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.470
 From is received like that would play Hello everyone 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.660
 Beneath it received a one questions 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:16.789
 It is often heard that there are pipes of various sizes. 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.300
 There are small pipes, large pipes , and pipes of various sizes. 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.840
 is 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.700
 By its size 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.280
 What's the difference 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.190
 We had that kind of question 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.180
 I would like to answer that question today 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:35.559
 Pipe that say if say Miya Petit After Ya' small pipe, 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:40.960
 It's a small type I'm buying waiting for at home It's like using in a shop 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.980
 It is the largest in the pipe covered in Well split and out of shops smoked or what this has One is 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.900
 It's a bike 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.800
 This house sings with the pipe of a new car which is old in Japan here 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.100
 It Sai is also by far the big pipe with this something 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 And here is the middle of the sag 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 It's a pipe called Tiana 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.770
 There are various pipes 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.690
 I think you'll various various things big things small 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.640
 What's the difference 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.190
 Well, it is often said 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.830
 From the part above this 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:22.510
 The length of this bottle minutes ago by this length 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.810
 It is often said that things like the taste will change, so the taste varies depending on the length 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.950
 I think it is a mistake to change 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.020
 But why 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.320
 Smoke coming swollen from above Well certainly 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.420
 The pipe gets cold when the long unwrapped name passes 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.810
 so 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.080
 Wind that smoke is somewhat mild 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 I think that is something that can be 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.240
 It seems that the pipe cigarette sound world is said well, but in this case water company c 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.880
 In the case of 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.420
 Let's go inside with water, so it's easy to chill out at home 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.460
 The effect of the length of the type is too much 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.300
 I think that there is no influence bus compared to cooling with water 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.690
 Then what is the difference? It is the amount of water 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.160
 Mizuno 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:22.880
 The amount of water that gets into the bottle I think this will greatly affect 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.880
 Required is to a small amount of water entering into it's such a small pipe 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.980
 It is that the amount of water also made many entering it's this big pipe 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.520
 As the amount of water changes, the effect of cooling the smoke changes as well 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.510
 The more water you can cool the smoke more firmly 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.180
 Then the cold smoke will soften the palate 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 In short , depending on the size of the by 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.430
 It is to say the force is different from the amount of entering water is cool the different and-out impossible 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.750
 So 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.790
 Well small but I'm easy to luck and more is cheaper bike 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.580
 I think and say either that it is advanced users 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.680
 It is quite difficult to find the position of the charcoal and the heat loss 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:11.310
 In Eee 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.800
 Even in somewhat loosely Well, this about the larger pipe fire acceleration 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.170
 It's about something like that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.170
 In that sense 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.720
 The person who was chosen for the first time people what large pipe 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.080
 I think it is easy to taste delicious smoke 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.380
 But after all this mossa 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.490
 It's tall, so if you put it on the table in your own way , it will be in the 1 type high position of the advance 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.080
 I know you 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.900
 There is a place that is a bit scary 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.950
 So 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.610
 I wonder if the size of this Kiara is about to stand on the table 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.920
 When 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.300
 I think 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.950
 Well each 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.740
 Although there is a short time, but there are various individuality each 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.710
 Nope or something is awfully unique 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.430
 Well I think that there is a bad place each good 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.990
 Please listen to anything you do not know anything else 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.990
 I will answer you it
