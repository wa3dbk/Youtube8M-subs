00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.770
 hello how about friends how are i 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.410
 I'm x 1050 with a new news of 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.870
 last minute has revealed almost 100% 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.850
 anar as we can see on your page 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.650
 officer showed us this is player and the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.510
 skills of the champion which looks 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.590
 which is a pretty tender little order 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.300
 but do not be fooled 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.740
 this is the spla to be published 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.660
 officially by watching a few minutes ago 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.790
 where we can see a little jordi 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.890
 quite tender and without what seems to be 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.600
 a hand instead has as an 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.190
 bone we see that little creature 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.720
 it is on a large animal footprint what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.510
 which is quite curious because it's from 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.310
 We 'll see why 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.750
 well let's see a little their 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 skills which have to do 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.160
 with his mood his passive nothing 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.230
 rage increases in combat once 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.970
 the rage bar fills up the next 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.890
 Nar's ability transforms him into mega 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.410
 nar giving him a bonus armor 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.830
 magic resistance life attack damage and 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.570
 movement speed yes very ap without al 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.730
 minimum is a skill he transforms 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.620
 in my win after a few seconds of 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.270
 anyway while in the form of 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.860
 to gain to go to continue to exhaust 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.600
 slowly and once it has been exhausted 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.270
 they go back to armin and after the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.800
 Nar formation briefly runs out and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.780
 can not win back rage during 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 a few seconds 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.740
 so this champion will be the one who uses 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.180
 these bars called tantrums and their 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.640
 skills will be defined according to their 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.340
 state of mind as I said before 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.780
 passing his bucket in harbin and split a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 small boomerang in one direction in 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.080
 concrete doing a damage to the first 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.390
 hit target and applying a lens 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.830
 or to this after the enemy's blow the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.270
 boomerang will return to session doing 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.490
 Damage all the enemies on their way 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.300
 without arcs this boomerang is reduced 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.820
 they hide very considerably 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.380
 in winning give he threw a huge rock in 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.000
 address an objective damaging and 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 reducing the speed of movements 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.470
 of this once is achieved nothing can 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.800
 pick up this rock and it is reduced its 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.800
 ass 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.980
 passing your w in nahr mini every third 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.500
 attack or skill against a target 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.540
 does a percentage of damage according to his life 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.850
 and applying magical damage 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.220
 in turn gaining movement speed 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.960
 in my win born supports on its 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.150
 hind legs before closing of 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.770
 hit your fists on the ground damaging and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.070
 studying all nearby enemies 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.070
 to them 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.780
 happening to turn in har mini maple spear 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.940
 a lesson to a goal by winning a 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.159
 bonus attack speed and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.780
 damage if nothing lands on a unit 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.790
 the balance again in that same direction 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.830
 and without swimming jumps over a unit 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.890
 enemy also causes damage and reduces the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.440
 movement speed of this one 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.209
 in armega nar launches himself a 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.800
 direction damaging and reducing the 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.220
 Movement speed of all 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.220
 nearby enemies 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.230
 and finally his multi nar launches a 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.750
 tantrum shaking all enemies 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.430
 around him in one direction all 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.900
 the thrown enemies are reduced 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.910
 your movement speed and they are 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.580
 considerably damaged while 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.680
 launched enemies are thrown worth the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.780
 redundancy to walls including 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.180
 turrets and low structures suffer damage 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.650
