00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.689
 it's him dedicated to all and fireflies happening to do it for the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.469
 test of a leather pouch signed proporta for anita 2 so here it is 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.619
 as you see it 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.189
 it's the color the show retained for our test pattern and brown it 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.390
 also exists 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.580
 so you can not feel it but actually the author of leather she is well 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.939
 present on their clothes is very nice 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.539
 he's happy the inner and the half Scottish way 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 with a little man the tonnage 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.730
 very fine when there is not either 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.240
 a lot of 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.500
 testers again added then a zipper to maintain the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.210
 Tablet 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 the main blame that we insult if you want to this type of skin I did 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 last year it was the fact that when we were in this sense then 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.610
 cross it this is the time of the trend alice is so we will test 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 with this iphone and ipad 2 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 I'm told inside like this 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.800
 then it must be strong though it is the convenience really do not have it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.150
 this happened during forced there for example 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.900
 a voice to be able to close there 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.240
 closing may be a little old fashioned 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 here it is really set up 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.670
 so obviously because it's rather complicated there 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.520
 to close not complicated it's a big word but let's say quite difficult 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100
 the tablet 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.189
 dogs relatively well even very well but until really very much 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.410
 inside the cover 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.090
 it is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 so suddenly well protected so the device in indonesia not tap the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.870
 angles maybe a little less about these couple jobs on a query him 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.430
 a tiny flap something to protect even for easter 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.440
 the dust between sion and works in a bag 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.369
 to take him out 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.320
 same principle 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 on the other hand it has to ap it is still quite strongly 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.939
 to recover his tablet 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.540
 who suddenly finds herself naked 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.220
 do you say we're getting older if you've woken up 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.980
 meters 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.590
 so mark o'meara with 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 there you forget right away it does not pass at all 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.539
 not even need to make this space understand 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.799
 after 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.159
 on the menu so it's really 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.529
 rather special type of product 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.609
 that will not address all other people more than you will not have 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.539
 function a word processor or video support 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.709
 it's really for transportation 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.719
 maybe for more for professionals the limit 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.560
 if they really want something that is pleasing to the eye 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.499
 touch my daughters 3 say no safer 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.589
 impressions for 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.439
 for appointments for example 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.349
 but she if we ourselves as the daily user down the paws 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.029
 rated at 2 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.479
 it's really not a product that we will remember 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.029
 to rely on the stars out of five 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.239
 three stars because we still like the quality of the product speaks 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.439
 the dark leather coating the sea water that emerges 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.489
 but the monf level practicality really for 40 euros it's true that it's very 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.209
 very expensive 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.879
 Well, listen, we'll leave ourselves on this point to ask or very soon on the 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.669
 head for the actor for other videos plague we still hear play 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:13.009
 well
