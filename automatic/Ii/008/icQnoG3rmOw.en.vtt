minecraft and there's one thing I hate

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.379 
minecraft and there's one thing I hate
about<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.950> that's<00:00:11.250> those<00:00:11.490> really<00:00:11.759> pesky

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
about it and that's those really pesky

creepers they always make me so angry
and<00:00:15.120> I'll<00:00:15.240> blow<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.570> up<00:00:15.809> my<00:00:15.960> creations<00:00:16.850> so<00:00:17.850> I'm

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
and I'll blow it up my creations so I'm

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
and I'll blow it up my creations so I'm
going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.810> teach<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.140> how<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.289> draw<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:19.800> today

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
going to teach you how to draw one today

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
going to teach you how to draw one today
so<00:00:21.980> let's<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> started<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.090> start<00:00:24.449> with

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
so let's just get started you start with

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.400 
so let's just get started you start with
that<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.670> cube<00:00:26.670> up<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.330> assume<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> know

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that a cube up here so I assume you know

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:45.819 
that a cube up here so I assume you know
how<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.679> draw<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> cube

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.799 

so<00:00:46.430> there's<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.730> cube<00:00:47.090> everything<00:00:47.450> in

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
so there's a cube everything in

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.360 
so there's a cube everything in
Minecraft<00:00:48.260> is<00:00:48.500> all<00:00:48.710> like<00:00:48.950> square<00:00:49.520> e<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.879> stuff

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
Minecraft is all like square e and stuff

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.360 
Minecraft is all like square e and stuff
next<00:00:52.370> we're<00:00:52.760> going<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.000> drop<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:54.410> body<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.309> you

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
next we're going to drop the body so you

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.240 
next we're going to drop the body so you
draw<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.910> line<00:00:56.239> that<00:00:56.660> goes<00:00:56.780> down<00:00:57.110> throw<00:00:57.890> up<00:00:58.040> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
draw a line that goes down throw up the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.310 
draw a line that goes down throw up the
middle<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.820> front<00:00:59.000> square<00:00:59.390> base<00:00:59.660> of<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
middle of the front square base of the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.860 
middle of the front square base of the
cube<00:01:00.649> then<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.730> draw<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> diagonal<00:01:02.540> line

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
cube then you draw a diagonal line

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.920 
cube then you draw a diagonal line
parallel<00:01:03.829> to<00:01:04.100> this<00:01:04.220> one<00:01:04.369> right<00:01:04.519> there<00:01:04.930> then

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
parallel to this one right there then

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.260 
parallel to this one right there then
you<00:01:06.050> draw<00:01:06.259> another<00:01:06.290> diagonal<00:01:07.159> line<00:01:07.490> parallel

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
you draw another diagonal line parallel

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.700 
you draw another diagonal line parallel
all<00:01:08.509> that<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:10.060> then<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.210> draw<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.479> line<00:01:11.720> up

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.749 

like<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:16.030> next<00:01:17.030> you're<00:01:17.360> going<00:01:17.509> to<00:01:17.570> draw<00:01:17.869> a

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
like that next you're going to draw a

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.859 
like that next you're going to draw a
line<00:01:19.759> straight<00:01:20.030> up<00:01:20.270> like<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:22.660> make<00:01:23.660> it

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
line straight up like that to make it

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.930 
line straight up like that to make it
look<00:01:24.440> more<00:01:24.800> QV<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.729> guess<00:01:26.649> then<00:01:27.649> you<00:01:27.920> draw<00:01:28.190> two

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
look more QV I guess then you draw two

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
look more QV I guess then you draw two
lines<00:01:29.210> right<00:01:29.390> here<00:01:29.509> parallel<00:01:30.410> lines<00:01:31.750> then<00:01:32.750> you

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
lines right here parallel lines then you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.510 
lines right here parallel lines then you
draw<00:01:33.170> two<00:01:33.410> lines<00:01:33.619> down<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:36.340> then<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
draw two lines down like this then you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.770 
draw two lines down like this then you
draw<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.789> line<00:01:37.910> right<00:01:38.450> here<00:01:39.470> parallel<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.399> one

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
draw a line right here parallel that one

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.910 
draw a line right here parallel that one
need<00:01:41.780> your<00:01:41.990> line<00:01:42.200> up<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:43.240> line<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:44.920> and

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
need your line up a line here and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.850 
need your line up a line here and
another<00:01:46.130> line<00:01:46.399> parallel<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.240> one<00:01:47.860> so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
another line parallel to that one so

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.040 
another line parallel to that one so
then<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.220> have<00:01:49.429> its<00:01:49.640> front<00:01:50.030> two<00:01:50.179> feet<00:01:50.420> how

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
then you have its front two feet how

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.130 
then you have its front two feet how
we're<00:01:51.200> going<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.349> draw<00:01:51.530> its<00:01:51.649> back<00:01:51.860> two<00:01:52.130> feet

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
we're going to draw its back two feet

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.389 
we're going to draw its back two feet
draw<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> line<00:01:54.410> right<00:01:54.590> here<00:01:55.869> then<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.989> line<00:01:57.399> kind

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
draw a line right here then a line kind

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.839 
draw a line right here then a line kind
of<00:01:58.610> slanted<00:01:59.179> towards<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.840> inside<00:02:00.319> there<00:02:00.849> then

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
of slanted towards the inside there then

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.029 
of slanted towards the inside there then
you<00:02:02.030> draw<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.360> line<00:02:02.509> right<00:02:02.720> here<00:02:03.259> again

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
you draw a line right here again

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.699 
you draw a line right here again
parallel<00:02:04.340> on<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.819> one

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
parallel on that one

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.900 
parallel on that one
draw<00:02:06.709> a<00:02:06.739> line<00:02:07.009> up<00:02:08.649> draw<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> line<00:02:09.890> connected<00:02:10.670> to

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
draw a line up draw a line connected to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.589 
draw a line up draw a line connected to
these<00:02:11.090> two<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:12.319> up<00:02:12.560> like<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.270> then<00:02:14.270> draw<00:02:14.569> a

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
these two so up like that then draw a

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.339 
these two so up like that then draw a
line<00:02:14.840> parallel<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.590> one<00:02:15.830> right<00:02:16.819> here<00:02:17.349> so

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
line parallel that one right here so

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.339 
line parallel that one right here so
there<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.830> two<00:02:19.220> feet<00:02:19.550> now<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:21.140> draw

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
there you have it two feet now to draw

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.400 
there you have it two feet now to draw
its<00:02:21.500> face<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.819> draw<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.650> square<00:02:24.650> right<00:02:24.770> here<00:02:24.830> a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
its face you draw a square right here a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.119 
its face you draw a square right here a
square<00:02:27.410> right<00:02:27.530> here<00:02:29.319> another<00:02:30.319> square<00:02:30.709> client

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
square right here another square client

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.949 
square right here another square client
like<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> smaller<00:02:31.879> square<00:02:32.239> right<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:32.900> the

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
like a smaller square right in the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.979 
like a smaller square right in the
middle<00:02:33.140> there<00:02:33.459> then<00:02:34.459> we<00:02:34.580> draw<00:02:34.879> sort<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.959> a

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
middle there then we draw sort of a

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.640 
middle there then we draw sort of a
rectangular<00:02:36.680> shape<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.930> draw<00:02:39.200> two

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
rectangular shape then you draw two

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.110 
rectangular shape then you draw two
squares<00:02:40.129> they<00:02:40.430> go<00:02:40.580> all<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> way<00:02:40.879> down<00:02:41.090> like

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
squares they go all the way down like

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.449 
squares they go all the way down like
that<00:02:42.220> they're<00:02:43.220> more<00:02:43.370> rectangles<00:02:45.250> now<00:02:46.250> we're

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
that they're more rectangles now we're

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.339
