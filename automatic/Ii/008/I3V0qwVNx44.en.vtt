00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.609
The world is full of Bible preaching and quoting
hypocrites.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.790
They preach the Bible, but they do not know
Jesus of the Bible.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.010
You can see it from their deeds.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.990
They indulge in the same sins as the world.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:33.010
They destroy the world, they wage wars, they
kill other people and yet they evangelize

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.300
the world.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.800
They send missionaries all over the world
to become just like them, hypocrites, fornicators,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:50.120
conformed to the world who even kill, abort,
their own children.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.079
They are involved in all kinds of sexual immorality.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.770
All the things that Jesus hates, all the things
that God forbid, they do those things and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.409
yet, they quote the Bible.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:15.010
They build churches and they tell people that
they are saved.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:25.191
Dear friends, do we think that we will escape
the wrath of God if we do those things, if

00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:33.560
we make a mockery of Jesus, Christ, who died
for our salvation?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.430
You can quote the bible as much as you like,
dear friend, but if you do not know Jesus

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.400
Christ and OBEY Him, you are on your way to
hell.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.250
If you meet Jesus Christ, He writes His laws
in your heart and you know what is pleasing

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.119
to Him, AND IF YOU LOVE HIM, you DO those
things.

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:11.260
You turn away from sin, from serving yourself,
from going after the things of the world,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.810
from hurting and killing other people and
blessing those who go and kill others, and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.830
you serve Jesus.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.639
You obey Him.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.609
You LOVE your neighbor, you don't KILL your
neighbor.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:31.969
Dear friends, who are we fooling?

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:38.349
Do we think that God is as blind as we are?

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.560
If we are children of God then we will have
the likeness of Jesus Christ.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.370
He came and showed us how a son of God will
behave, how he will live.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.989
He will live in fellowship with his Father
all the time, doing everything to please God,

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.700
in UTTER HOLINESS and UTTER OBEDIENCE.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:19.319
You can carry a Bible, friend, you can quote
all the verses but if you do not OBEY Jesus

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:32.579
and DO what He said, He will say to you:”Go
away from Me you hypocrite, who works wickedness!”

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:43.079
Are you following Jesus, or are you just a
church going, Bible quoting hypocrite on his

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.370
way to hell?

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.989
Do you truly love Jesus and obey Him?

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.799
Jesus knows friend!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.170
We cannot fool Him.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.209
REPENT and seek Jesus, go on your knees and
cry out to Him for mercy.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.520
Ask Him to change you, give you a new heart,
so that you can love your neighbor and be

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520
serious.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.819
Stop being a hypocrite!

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:19.191
Be serious with God, or else, you will not
enter the Kingdom of heaven, my friend.

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:20.040
May Jesus bless you.
