00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
gigabyte of RAM so not only is it 64-bit

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.450 
gigabyte of RAM so not only is it 64-bit
and<00:01:04.199> you've<00:01:04.289> got<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.589> those<00:01:04.769> highways<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and you've got all those highways to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.069 
and you've got all those highways to
move<00:01:05.579> all<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> information<00:01:06.149> but<00:01:06.840> you've<00:01:06.960> got

move all that information but you've got
a<00:01:07.110> gigabyte<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> RAM<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a gigabyte of RAM so that's like the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.520 
a gigabyte of RAM so that's like the
police<00:01:09.060> making<00:01:09.390> sure<00:01:09.510> things<00:01:09.659> keep<00:01:09.810> moving
