to<00:03:19.419> get<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.659> weapon<00:03:19.840> up<00:03:20.139> it's<00:03:20.379> not<00:03:20.530> even<00:03:20.680> that

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
to get this weapon up it's not even that

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.219 
to get this weapon up it's not even that
hard<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:21.129> get<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.340> weapon<00:03:21.900> actually<00:03:22.900> but

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
hard to get this weapon actually but

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.699 
hard to get this weapon actually but
then<00:03:23.379> flair<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.519> hard<00:03:24.909> I<00:03:25.120> don't<00:03:25.180> think<00:03:25.709> it's

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
then flair is hard I don't think it's

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.990 
then flair is hard I don't think it's
not<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.040> best<00:03:27.190> shotgun<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.699> game<00:03:27.849> but

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
not the best shotgun in the game but

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.059 
not the best shotgun in the game but
then<00:03:28.150> it's<00:03:28.299> pretty<00:03:28.510> decent<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.709> should<00:03:29.889> get

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
then it's pretty decent you should get

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.360 
then it's pretty decent you should get
it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
it

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.180 
it
maybe<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.510> shouldn't<00:03:31.840> if<00:03:32.109> you're<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.829> fan<00:03:33.159> of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
maybe you shouldn't if you're a fan of

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.699 
maybe you shouldn't if you're a fan of
Jacob<00:03:33.639> shotguns<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.239> am<00:03:34.479> a<00:03:34.510> fan<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:35.079> you

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
Jacob shotguns I am a fan of it you

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.610 
Jacob shotguns I am a fan of it you
should<00:03:36.010> get<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.780> very<00:03:37.870> strong<00:03:38.349> but

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
should get it this is very strong but

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.920 
should get it this is very strong but
then<00:03:38.769> Lexy<00:03:39.370> puts<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.909> off<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.449> my<00:03:40.629> opinion

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
then Lexy puts it off in my opinion

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.289 
then Lexy puts it off in my opinion
that's<00:03:41.709> why<00:03:41.919> I<00:03:41.949> mostly<00:03:42.549> use

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
that's why I mostly use

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.240 
that's why I mostly use
Hyperion<00:03:44.019> shotguns<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.040> egg<00:03:45.220> is

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
Hyperion shotguns because the egg is

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.199 
Hyperion shotguns because the egg is
higher<00:03:45.639> electracy<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.440> that's<00:03:48.400> basically<00:03:48.849> it

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
higher electracy so that's basically it

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.369 
higher electracy so that's basically it
you<00:03:49.239> guys<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.750> watch<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.900> rest<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.290> the
