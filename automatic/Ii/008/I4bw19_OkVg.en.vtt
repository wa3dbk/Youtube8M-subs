00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
just in the Sun but we know that the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.650 
just in the Sun but we know that the
glaciers<00:02:21.590> are<00:02:22.520> often<00:02:22.970> tricky<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
glaciers are often tricky with the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.500 
glaciers are often tricky with the
weather<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:25.280> would<00:02:25.490> be<00:02:25.640> just<00:02:25.670> too<00:02:26.030> much<00:02:26.210> to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
weather and it would be just too much to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.110 
weather and it would be just too much to
skip<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.110> bad<00:02:27.290> days<00:02:27.560> otherwise<00:02:28.520> we<00:02:28.970> would

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
skip the bad days otherwise we would

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
skip the bad days otherwise we would
only<00:02:29.360> ski<00:02:30.400> half<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> day's<00:02:31.850> probably<00:02:32.390> so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
only ski half of the day's probably so

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.960 
only ski half of the day's probably so
we're<00:02:33.650> training<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.100> any<00:02:34.250> kind<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.580> conditions

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
how okay now we can so we have this

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.180
