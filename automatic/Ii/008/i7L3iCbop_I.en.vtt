00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 on television, notice that today we are going to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 making this cake has a little bit of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.790
 madoff acre system and do not tell me 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.309
 it's like they loaded the play is 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 the joke I say let's vary ok but what 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.190
 that there was good we have what is sugar 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.080
 and librilla alhama butter 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.060
 room temperature that is the title 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.050
 touch that kind of ointment and we put the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 sugar ok ya lavat and ok very well ya baja 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.670
 low I'm going to add the eggs of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.380
 bonus for 11 and will beat after each 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.760
 edition exactly and then I'm going to put 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.100
 here all that are the wet ones ok as 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.890
 comes to be the juice of the inco must move 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.829
 very years a third of vanilla cup the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.379
 vanilla very well and the concentrate of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 abstract limb of the letter I'm going to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.730
 put a few droplets of green using the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.640
 idea 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.160
 already with a to see let's see if I 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.379
 allow you to download it to see they are 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.050
 lowering please because look if you 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.720
 if none of the blenders is true 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.270
 achieved worked pink and bowl 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.840
 irwin only we would do is wear 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.010
 both as much the leaf as the case though 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.930
 I already have it very well 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.930
 we danced the goal 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.400
 aguilar 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.400
 baking powder that's baking 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.130
 and I remind you so much that it was colored 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.990
 bicarbonate when we put it in the east 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.390
 in other 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.659
 when we put him in some cake 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 bicarbonate which is a chemical leavening 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.759
 what is it that is very important below and 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.930
 that it is a leavening chemical that 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.770
 if we do not put an acid of nothing 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.479
 as it is not a reaction 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.860
 then because as remain as stand there 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.750
 there is nothing else 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 ok so that you may see a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.429
 recipe when the recipe says carry 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.099
 bicarbonate look for the acid surely 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.510
 so in the banana on the lemon in some 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.130
 account 2000 in the average car by 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.959
 example in drug use look and that's what 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.970
 we found is there we are seeing the 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.650
 reaction if they are not going to be a missile 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.080
 poisonous they are the experts in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.049
 pastry join the dry with the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.380
 humid very well I will not go back to 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.380
 go down 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.170
 mix 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.350
 Paris you are not talking to them 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.450
 we need your contribution but the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.030
 mix of the remarkable plots this day 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.650
 does not have anyone cake true name like 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.080
 the last time with the time of the pass that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.760
 it was very successful was the tree and ximo 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 of chocolate 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.750
 and the coconut was also very good 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.790
 good bacon you do not know now that I was 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.030
 working people liked it a lot 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.920
 vegetable oil and half a cup so such 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.920
 that we're going to use a mold for bread that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.060
 of approximately 23 centimeters by 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.840
 about 10 9 centimeters and about 7 of 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.610
 height 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.049
 let's make a tray also ready 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.450
 so that we are baked much more 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.519
 even and the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.680
 pour good my mom is going to do it goes to 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.340
 put that mixture in the mold and we're going 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.250
 to pray 350 degrees herring and 180 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.040
 centigrade but the goal is prices and 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.799
 after a soon 45 to 50 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.970
 minutes are going to insert a stick this one 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.970
 leave the room 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.080
 to see that the mold order is 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.080
 perfect they are previously greased 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.610
 we need sugar glass sugar 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.340
 glass because of the humidity that exists in the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.320
 environment tends to become lumps like 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.660
 they are finite it starts to become lumps 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.460
 so I suggest a lot that before 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.710
 I 'm going to use it for any 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.540
 situation for anyone and without for 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.190
 any tuna for any cake 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.770
 for whatever I was doing one is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.210
 pressure absolution and I do this saying 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.970
 that I love doing I'm going to put them 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.490
 first the lemon juice all the juice of 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.030
 lemon is going to put 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.190
 and then I'm adding little by little 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.889
 give it the consistency of milk 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.970
 suddenly you can enter all and of 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.169
 suddenly you can not enter all this 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.820
 exactly and depending on the humidity that 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.260
 have the sugar but we are very 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.610
 here is beginning to take consistency 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.690
 and look, he did not get all the milk and 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.690
 we have a consistency 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.180
 to read what covers the only thing we're going to 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.130
 do that is very important 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.030
 It is very important that you put Mrs. 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.070
 always a plastic on the bottom 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.630
 and put it on grid that's going to 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.000
 help very much gentlemen had to 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.190
 recover let see the oh yes 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.190
 exactly hard 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.560
 we put ourselves in the middle 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.270
 everything we can in the middle and we let 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.510
 he is falling to his liking 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.280
 more meaningfully you can not consent 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.410
 exactly to extract or can we 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.270
 let a spatula but we can 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.540
 put it everywhere is also very 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.880
 important a little bit here what remains 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.880
 here so little here 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.960
 It is not a delight and they know that if 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.450
 they set the price difference is 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.370
 wonderful I do not think the other one comes out 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.160
 little karit does not fit here every 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.400
 you will love it says this 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.980
 dessert has a costing but this one more 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.360
 economic look that I know what to do and 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.040
 I 'll tell you that it suits us a lot 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.020
 more of course do it with manolo 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.270
 us instead of buying it and we already 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.330
 has a fire a cost approximately 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.330
 more or less than about 45 pesos 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:07.380
