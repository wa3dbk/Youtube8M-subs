hello welcome back so this is day 5 of
inktober<00:00:03.389> so<00:00:03.840> today<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.140> wanted<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.380> draw<00:00:04.650> a

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
inktober so today I wanted to draw a

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.070 
inktober so today I wanted to draw a
hair<00:00:04.980> which<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.029> what<00:00:06.299> I'm<00:00:06.390> drawing<00:00:06.720> right<00:00:06.750> now

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
hair which is what I'm drawing right now

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.890 
hair which is what I'm drawing right now
and<00:00:07.319> but<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.010> decided<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.610> do<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.300> sepia

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and but I decided to do it with a sepia

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.720 
and but I decided to do it with a sepia
browning<00:00:10.530> instead<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.099> there's<00:00:11.400> no<00:00:11.550> more

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
browning instead of there's no more

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.310 
browning instead of there's no more
Indian<00:00:12.030> ink<00:00:12.179> just<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> figured<00:00:12.840> that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
Indian ink just because I figured that

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.470 
Indian ink just because I figured that
since<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> rabbit<00:00:14.790> hair<00:00:15.089> thing

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
since it is like a rabbit hair thing

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.300 
since it is like a rabbit hair thing
that<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.139> know<00:00:16.230> having<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> brown<00:00:16.830> might<00:00:17.100> make

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
that you know having it brown might make

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
that you know having it brown might make
a<00:00:17.520> bit<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> sense<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.420> also<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.080> these

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
a bit of sense and also I have all these

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.660 
a bit of sense and also I have all these
colored<00:00:19.529> inks<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.890> I've<00:00:20.010> literally<00:00:20.400> just

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
colored inks and I've literally just

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.609 
colored inks and I've literally just
never<00:00:21.000> used<00:00:21.300> them<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> think<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.410> might<00:00:22.470> be

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
never used them so I think this might be

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.019 
never used them so I think this might be
a<00:00:22.740> good<00:00:22.800> opportunity<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.550> do<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a good opportunity to do that so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.519 
a good opportunity to do that so
