00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello very good everyone is here today and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.950
 is doing the second part of the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.720
 curiosities that you did not know about 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.010
 ring of legends the truth that there are 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.780
 a lot of curiosities but this time 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.370
 chosen to the most interesting can that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 the jungles or maybe not so 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.389
 let's start with the video to start 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.340
 travel cassiopeia was the first champion 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 in having the maximum difficulty this is 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.250
 because riot wanted to get a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.230
 character that was strong but difficult 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.640
 to use is why if you controlled your 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.260
 mechanical could destroy all 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 currently cassiopeia is one of the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.439
 strongest champions of the line of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 medium and I also knew that if you use 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 Cassiopeia and in the store he writes 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.000
 hat you will appear boots and talking 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.770
 of the store 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 Did you know that if you write stonesoft damage 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 you will appear the trifuerza this is due to 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.129
 that freak one of the casters of the ls 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 American called without one of the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.520
 games where they used it according to him is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.940
 strongest elite of all league of 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.980
 legends 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.539
 something very interesting and useful especially 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.100
 if you get to the boat line it's that 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.989
 morgan to miss schultis secrets 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.250
 strip to the smoke screen so the 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.719
 next instead of running from the last and 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.000
 morgana better than having the vision with your 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.980
 can and you'll save yourself from that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.960
 you knew that Zaira has rivalry with 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.870
 mission letters referring to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.430
 plants versus office 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.409
 you also knew that the team that has 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.850
 best minion score encourage your own 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.850
 domain and this put faster 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.329
 long years pains in China 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.520
 created a new mode called camera 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.140
 magmatic or magma chamber east 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.450
 consisting of one against one or 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.979
 of two against two the players could 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 win makes foundations 100 subjects 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.369
 destroying the enemy turret or 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.110
 getting the first blood if it were 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.329
 one against one or doing two murders 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.649
 in a two against two 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.539
 this new mode and new map was so 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.399
 only one line then one guy showed up 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.679
 enea servers as bates of 1 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.939
 against 1 and 2 versus 2 this mode was for 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.950
 some very funny and for others not 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.380
 but those who liked it still claim for 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.520
 to re-implement it and this 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.289
 Last curiosity that I will tell you 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.959
 I'm sure you know her, you've heard the 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.189
 name of this character called bours and 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.349
 it's going to be released on the first of april 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.869
 chrysler created its smell or its history 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.250
 he even talked about his many skills 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.289
 people expected the departure of euros 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.520
 for that day but what happened in reality 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.500
 everything was a joke for the day of the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.479
 innocent back in the USA what happened 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.009
 was that he never came out and instead of him 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.539
 warwick with a new skin in which 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.799
 I could see warwick inside the skin of 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.840
 a manatee what I wanted to say is that 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.340
 warwick had killed one but all the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.440
 Leo center by rivers did not finish and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.480
 when putting the cornerback roared in the store 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.100
 to buy it the skin cost 5000 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.110
 skid and people wondered why 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.180
 but only those who dared 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.920
 for that price at the time it came out 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.500
 on the purchase screen actually the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.180
 skin only cost 50 the rope and this is 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.290
 it happened for a short time that's why 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 this ski that is one of the most 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.530
 limited of the whole game and the good of 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.660
 kerry battle in fact this curiosity 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.190
 is that many people now remember ur and 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.250
 many ask to take it out but we know 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.570
