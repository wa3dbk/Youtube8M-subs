00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
these guys can use of it all my guess is

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.110 
these guys can use of it all my guess is
a<00:02:06.369> better

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.850 

first<00:02:11.120> but<00:02:11.900> anyway<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.230> guys<00:02:12.350> can<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.770> it

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
first but anyway you guys can see it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.550 
first but anyway you guys can see it
from<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> car<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.960> moving<00:02:15.050> into

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
from there so if the car is moving into

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.920 
from there so if the car is moving into
neutral<00:02:16.040> that's<00:02:16.280> again<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.510> speed<00:02:20.780> goes

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
neutral that's again and the speed goes

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.470 
neutral that's again and the speed goes
up<00:02:21.170> with<00:02:21.380> gear<00:02:21.620> ratio<00:02:22.010> dr.<00:02:22.700> duration<00:02:23.270> of

should<00:03:28.250> be<00:03:28.310> starting<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.820> together<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.709> you

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
should be starting a together so you

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.060 
should be starting a together so you
point<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.610> game<00:03:31.640> is<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:32.470> its<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.620> get<00:03:33.800> then

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
point of the game is to its to get then

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.070 
point of the game is to its to get then
oh<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.090> think<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.480> turned<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.780> lights<00:03:35.959> on
