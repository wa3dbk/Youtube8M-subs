was shooting all morning and this was a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.460 
was shooting all morning and this was a
little<00:00:29.390> bit<00:00:29.480> later<00:00:29.689> but<00:00:29.990> I<00:00:30.050> got<00:00:30.199> some<00:00:30.320> nice

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
little bit later but I got some nice

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.040 
little bit later but I got some nice
cloud<00:00:30.830> cover<00:00:31.160> over<00:00:31.580> so<00:00:32.090> that<00:00:32.390> was<00:00:32.750> what<00:00:32.870> i<00:00:32.900> was

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
cloud cover over so that was what i was

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.600 
cloud cover over so that was what i was
going<00:00:33.260> for<00:00:33.379> sometimes<00:00:33.949> i<00:00:34.040> like<00:00:34.070> seeing<00:00:34.430> that

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
going for sometimes i like seeing that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.160 
going for sometimes i like seeing that
cloud<00:00:34.880> cover<00:00:35.210> because<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:35.899> have<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.050> little

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
cloud cover because you have a little

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.990 
cloud cover because you have a little
bit<00:00:36.290> more<00:00:36.440> interest<00:00:36.980> versus<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.430> clear<00:00:37.820> blue

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
bit more interest versus a clear blue

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.950 
bit more interest versus a clear blue
sky<00:00:38.120> or<00:00:38.719> a<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.309> know<00:00:40.399> a<00:00:40.430> solid<00:00:40.850> white<00:00:41.059> sky<00:00:41.390> from

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
sky or a you know a solid white sky from

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.459 
sky or a you know a solid white sky from
those<00:00:42.170> clouds<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.570> what<00:00:44.570> I'm<00:00:44.690> looking<00:00:45.140> for<00:00:45.350> is

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
those clouds so what I'm looking for is

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:46.780 
those clouds so what I'm looking for is
something<00:00:45.680> interesting<00:00:46.340> something<00:00:46.370> that

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
something interesting something that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.119 
something interesting something that
catches<00:00:46.940> my<00:00:47.120> eye<00:00:47.620> thinking<00:00:48.620> about<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:48.950> rule

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
catches my eye thinking about the rule

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.470 
catches my eye thinking about the rule
of<00:00:49.160> thirds<00:00:49.370> thinking<00:00:49.820> about<00:00:50.000> my<00:00:50.090> foreground

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
of thirds thinking about my foreground

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.330 
of thirds thinking about my foreground
middle<00:00:50.750> ground<00:00:50.840> background<00:00:51.590> some<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.309> my

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
middle ground background some of my

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.330 
middle ground background some of my
normal<00:00:52.719> rules<00:00:53.719> of<00:00:53.960> composition<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.890> kind<00:00:55.309> of

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
normal rules of composition that kind of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.920 
normal rules of composition that kind of
thing<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:55.730> that's<00:00:56.239> really<00:00:56.390> what<00:00:56.600> you're<00:00:56.690> going

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
thing so that's really what you're going

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.709 
thing so that's really what you're going
after<00:00:57.170> as<00:00:57.649> far<00:00:57.860> as<00:00:57.949> your<00:00:58.760> landscape<00:00:59.360> photos

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
after as far as your landscape photos

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.389 
after as far as your landscape photos
then<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.350> course<00:01:00.590> lighting<00:01:01.010> what<00:01:01.190> does<00:01:01.370> a

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
then of course lighting what does a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.510 
then of course lighting what does a
light<00:01:01.640> look<00:01:01.850> like<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.420> good<00:01:02.629> or<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.050> bad

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
light look like is it good or is it bad

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.950 
light look like is it good or is it bad
time<00:01:04.520> of<00:01:04.550> day<00:01:04.850> really<00:01:05.180> has<00:01:05.300> everything<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.780> do

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
time of day really has everything to do

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.570 
time of day really has everything to do
with<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.320> light<00:01:06.530> whether<00:01:06.950> its<00:01:07.189> first<00:01:07.430> thing

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
with the light whether its first thing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.770 
with the light whether its first thing
in<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.729> morning<00:01:08.090> whether<00:01:08.240> it's<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.570> last

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
in the morning whether it's the last

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.800 
in the morning whether it's the last
thing<00:01:08.900> in<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.170> evening<00:01:10.119> rarely<00:01:11.119> what<00:01:11.630> do<00:01:11.750> I

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
thing in the evening rarely what do I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.510 
thing in the evening rarely what do I
think<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.320> middle<00:01:12.619> of<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.799> day<00:01:12.979> photos<00:01:13.400> are

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
think the middle of the day photos are

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.460 
think the middle of the day photos are
going<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.700> be<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.030> great<00:01:14.290> obviously<00:01:15.290> that

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
going to be that great obviously that

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.910 
going to be that great obviously that
can<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:16.490> proven<00:01:17.390> wrong<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.770> would

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
can be proven wrong but you would

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.190 
can be proven wrong but you would
typically<00:01:19.280> want<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.640> try<00:01:20.150> for<00:01:20.210> at<00:01:20.630> least<00:01:20.750> your

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
typically want to try for at least your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.830 
typically want to try for at least your
best<00:01:21.470> bet<00:01:21.979> or<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.670> ones<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.030> are<00:01:23.150> early<00:01:23.479> or

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
best bet or the ones that are early or

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.249 
best bet or the ones that are early or
late<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.590> day<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.580> how<00:01:26.299> did<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.570> create<00:01:26.869> this

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
late in the day so how did I create this

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.100 
late in the day so how did I create this
well<00:01:27.920> scenic<00:01:28.520> photos<00:01:28.729> typically<00:01:29.509> are<00:01:29.780> shot

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
well scenic photos typically are shot

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.130 
well scenic photos typically are shot
with<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.439> smaller<00:01:31.100> aperture<00:01:31.700> meaning<00:01:32.689> it's<00:01:32.930> a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
with a smaller aperture meaning it's a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.410 
with a smaller aperture meaning it's a
higher<00:01:33.439> number<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.610> smaller<00:01:34.909> aperture<00:01:35.390> on

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
higher number that smaller aperture on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.990 
higher number that smaller aperture on
this<00:01:35.750> particular<00:01:36.020> photo<00:01:36.380> was<00:01:36.619> F<00:01:36.829> 11<00:01:37.340> meaning

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
this particular photo was F 11 meaning

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.819 
this particular photo was F 11 meaning
I'm<00:01:38.090> letting<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.689> mid-range<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.470> lot<00:01:39.650> of

I'm letting in a mid-range a lot of

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.710 
I'm letting in a mid-range a lot of
amount<00:01:40.189> of<00:01:40.340> light<00:01:40.579> but<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> have<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.360> lot<00:01:41.689> of

amount of light but I have a lot of

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.660 
amount of light but I have a lot of
depth<00:01:42.079> of<00:01:42.200> field<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:42.650> i<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.250> make<00:01:43.400> sure<00:01:43.520> that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
depth of field I i can make sure that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.810 
depth of field I i can make sure that

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.490 
my 24 to 70 lens on my nikon d3s and i
was<00:01:51.229> at<00:01:51.320> iso<00:01:51.770> 8<00:01:52.009> i'm<00:01:52.340> sorry<00:01:52.610> iso<00:01:53.090> 200<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:53.960> this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
was at iso 8 i'm sorry iso 200 on this

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.170 
was at iso 8 i'm sorry iso 200 on this
particular<00:01:54.770> photo<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.850> believe<00:01:56.060> my

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
particular photo and I believe my

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.389 
particular photo and I believe my
shutter<00:01:56.420> speed<00:01:56.509> was<00:01:56.930> one<00:01:57.439> sixtieth<00:01:57.860> or<00:01:58.130> 11

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
shutter speed was one sixtieth or 11

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.200 
shutter speed was one sixtieth or 11
twenty<00:01:58.670> fifth<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.090> second<00:01:59.829> so<00:02:01.060> metered<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
twenty fifth of a second so metered the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.859 
twenty fifth of a second so metered the
photo<00:02:02.500> took<00:02:03.500> one<00:02:03.710> looked<00:02:04.399> at<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.790> said<00:02:05.030> that's

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
photo took one looked at it said that's

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.499 
photo took one looked at it said that's
not<00:02:06.020> bad<00:02:06.290> okay<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.670> think<00:02:07.969> what<00:02:08.119> happened

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
not bad okay but I think what happened

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.150 
not bad okay but I think what happened
was<00:02:08.540> is<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.410> fact<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:09.950> so

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
was is the the fact that it was so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.430 
was is the the fact that it was so
bright<00:02:10.429> outside<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.629> I<00:02:11.660> was<00:02:11.870> looking<00:02:12.200> at<00:02:12.319> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
bright outside that I was looking at the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.500 
bright outside that I was looking at the
photo<00:02:12.709> maybe<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.400> checked<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.819> histogram<00:02:14.300> and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
photo maybe I checked the histogram and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390 
photo maybe I checked the histogram and
or<00:02:15.260> maybe<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.530> didn't<00:02:15.890> check<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.069> hist

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
or maybe I didn't check the hist

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.160 
or maybe I didn't check the hist
on<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:16.849> particular<00:02:16.970> one<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.689> been<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> while

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
on this particular one it's been a while

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.869 
on this particular one it's been a while
since<00:02:18.409> I<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> don't<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.700> hundred

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
since I so I don't know for a hundred

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.390 
since I so I don't know for a hundred
percent<00:02:20.209> sure<00:02:20.379> but<00:02:21.379> bottom<00:02:22.040> line<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.370> I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
percent sure but bottom line is I

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.190 
percent sure but bottom line is I
overexposed<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.659> think<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.930> was<00:02:24.049> so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
overexposed it and I think it was so

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.660 
overexposed it and I think it was so
bright<00:02:24.470> outside<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:25.069> might<00:02:25.189> have<00:02:25.340> thrown<00:02:25.489> me

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
bright outside it might have thrown me

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.759 
bright outside it might have thrown me
off<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.239> screen<00:02:26.569> thinking<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.680> was

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
off on the screen thinking that it was

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.710 
off on the screen thinking that it was
good<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.760> happens<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.209> lot<00:02:29.329> because<00:02:29.390> of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
good and that happens a lot because of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.479 
good and that happens a lot because of
the<00:02:29.780> way<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.049> LCD<00:02:30.470> screens<00:02:30.799> work<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.250> needs<00:02:31.340> to

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the way the LCD screens work it needs to

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.160 
the way the LCD screens work it needs to
be<00:02:31.610> super<00:02:31.909> bright<00:02:32.180> for<00:02:32.599> our<00:02:32.689> eyes<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.989> be<00:02:33.109> able

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
be super bright for our eyes to be able

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.860 
be super bright for our eyes to be able
to<00:02:33.349> see<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.620> versus<00:02:34.069> indoors<00:02:34.549> where<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.780> know

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
to see it versus indoors where you know

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.119 
to see it versus indoors where you know
there<00:02:35.989> isn't<00:02:36.290> much<00:02:36.439> light<00:02:36.650> hit<00:02:36.829> in<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.950> back

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
there isn't much light hit in the back

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.009 
there isn't much light hit in the back
of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.340> camera<00:02:37.579> so<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.239> definitely

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
of the camera so that can definitely

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.300 
of the camera so that can definitely
make<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.230> difference<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.829> that's<00:02:40.099> why<00:02:40.280> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
make a difference so that's why I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.530 
make a difference so that's why I
recommend<00:02:40.819> taking<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.239> look<00:02:41.269> at<00:02:41.420> your

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
recommend taking a look at your

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.780 
recommend taking a look at your
histogram<00:02:41.810> all<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.439> time<00:02:42.650> making<00:02:43.489> sure<00:02:43.519> it's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
histogram all the time making sure it's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.530 
histogram all the time making sure it's
not<00:02:43.939> pushed<00:02:44.329> over<00:02:44.659> too<00:02:44.840> far<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:46.090> focus<00:02:47.090> point<00:02:47.329> I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
not pushed over too far so focus point I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.360 
not pushed over too far so focus point I
was<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:47.930> focused<00:02:48.379> on<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> mountains<00:02:49.010> maybe

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
was just focused on the mountains maybe

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.670 
was just focused on the mountains maybe
I<00:02:49.489> did<00:02:50.239> take<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> couple<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.870> exposures<00:02:51.440> for

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
I did take a couple of exposures for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.849 
I did take a couple of exposures for
this<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.489> find<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.970> right<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:54.500> focus

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
this to find the right one just focus

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.710 
this to find the right one just focus
down<00:02:55.069> towards<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.549> bottom<00:02:55.639> third<00:02:56.150> somewhere

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
down towards the bottom third somewhere

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.289 
down towards the bottom third somewhere
and<00:02:57.159> you<00:02:58.159> know<00:02:58.280> about<00:02:58.549> two-thirds<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.120> way

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
and you know about two-thirds the way

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.360 
and you know about two-thirds the way
into<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.900> image<00:03:00.079> that'll<00:03:00.739> be<00:03:00.829> good<00:03:00.980> for<00:03:01.220> that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
into the image that'll be good for that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.149 
into the image that'll be good for that
