00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.310
 hello mom hey linda hoffman i call if i was 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.110
 that mysterious mother work if she 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.470
 captured something 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.470
 cool 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 I am very excited to discover what 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 that crawls on my walls 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 client now I will climb the roof to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 reveal it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 I really hope that it is a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.810
 squirrel and not a raccoon because a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 Raccoon attacks directly to the jugular 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.780
 Hi, my friend, Bayern, it's nice 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 or red devils you almost make me fall from the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.550
 Devils roof if the boys would have 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.199
 stumbled upon and would have shattered the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 I'm glad I caught him before 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.710
 that nobody scares them 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 normally the raccoons are less 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.299
 aggressive than that with reason in what if 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 until these people look at you I thought 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.970
 you were a friend squirrel 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 but I solved my investigation 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:23.220
 it worked so this drag catches you and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 I will free you that you will like 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.140
 this shows that you must have a lot 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.330
 Beware of wild animals because there 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.570
 little kids around here and less fierce 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 that this animal if that little girl is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.540
 I would have found him could have 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.540
 He killed this friend is fierce 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.350
 hello hey hey no demons 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.329
 Hey look at this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.820
 friend almost ripped me off is the finger for a 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.840
 centimeter that happens to you tried to 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.320
 get out of here 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.320
 deranged 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.090
 I do not blame the raccoon for trying 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.759
 defend yourself being aggressive is your way 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.120
 to protect your environment but this friend 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.879
 live among the trees not among humans 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.739
 I'm weak and you found something if I have 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:26.450
 one here so a raccoon will take it down 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.450
 so you can see it well 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.200
 it was not easy to lower it from the ceiling 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.660
 what a nice animal I did not 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.980
 I killed the raccoon I was dying in the attempt 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.980
 I think it was a success 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.110
 well here is he is the cause of everything 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.080
 that noise but you can see that it's very 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.700
 aggressive look at him see that that's what 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.060
 I would make a finger if I could 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.739
 and what are the noises that we have not 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 heard nothing more 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.150
 really cool friend the boots are 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.790
 new you're breaking your neck what 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.750
 you will do with it good I will take it to the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.280
 owned by a friend of 700 hectares 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 I will liberate there to do what 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.380
 pleases him without causing him problems 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.510
 another if you have to remove it from the fields of 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.819
 golf is very aggressive to wander 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.670
 on these sides a child could bump into 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.489
 with him and although he looks tender, it is not 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.470
 would attack immediately as they have not heard 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.640
 other noises in the ceiling since 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.400
 we captured the raccoon 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.980
 I'm sure we caught the only one 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.560
 guilty now the family can 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.650
 rest quiet thank you I'm at 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.400
 order I think I'll take it before 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.400
 that hurt me 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.989
 say goodbye to billy 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.950
