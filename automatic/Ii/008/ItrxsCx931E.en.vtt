00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.200

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.420

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.420
 doneinchem 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.999
 though i don't know 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.779
 yet 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.220
 I 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.220
 why 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 I pushed the time in 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.630
 upside down 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.630
 at the start 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.930
 you cannot start 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.470
 we bring 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.640
 mre 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 the metal bar I am a start in the city center 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.170
 however, wait 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.440
 3 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.800
 I think I write quite a bit 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.960
 This is precisely not what you would call a little bit of a man who is quick and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.960
 therefore i have a lot of money that your avatar 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.130
 The man that way is the problem that Raymaekers quickly ran out of 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.460
 children 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.950
 that is certainly not the future 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 Chairman 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.130
 is going 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.910
 but who have a bit of a struggle that's a bit like we keep flying there 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.390
 gran canaria 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 Well just two tons to the light 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.250
 no but I will stick around 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
 i have another american robert d 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.950
 so there were, of course, nowhere 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.210
 who should be able to do that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.409
 this fall in the cinemas though there is no problem 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.179
 photo af eb 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.839
 sketch the batteries 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.839
 there are always unclear reasons 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.069
 use
