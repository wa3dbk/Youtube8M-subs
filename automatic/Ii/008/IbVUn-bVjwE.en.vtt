00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 yes as I said a few excerpts I want 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.160
 read from the book 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.859
 I have just now time for a 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 slam in braunschweig because of the choice 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.220
 at the flex only penultimate football-wm 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600
 behavior football slam and were 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.640
 Invited if I do not have a text too 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.510
 I could write as well 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 and he in that the sentence comes before that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.050
 I'm not a football fan now 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.050
 but also no football fan 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.840
 it is partly because of that that I am 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.020
 also a short distance near one 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 stadium lived and because 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 somehow the people somehow 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.989
 a bit unsympathetic and that's it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 again every one of this book ur-rhine 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.480
 flopped and indeed it is in this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.140
 section about it torben the storyteller 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 is bestowed by his best buddy 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.430
 with old cards for a concert in 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.880
 dortmund and the two make themselves 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
 on the way, however, they have 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270
 something displaces and they are with the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.409
 public transport 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.020
 on the way what I have completely displaced 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.909
 is the football game the same evening 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.650
 dortmund against schalke in dortmund 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.210
 the train is crammed with 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.619
 costumed people who pretend 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.049
 would you be able to play football 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 I hate that they sing the ones 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.869
 shitty songs in the world with titles 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.509
 like oli schalala or bitch Zicke 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.479
 Zacke hoi hoi hoi probably because more 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.340
 text would scare you 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.140
 where I once go with us 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.009
 but then sits with her after the train 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.009
 to sing auschwitz 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.240
 because they people wonders never 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.500
 My mood is going strong direction grumpy 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.600
 we are apparently the only ones 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.590
 Concertos the stupid or lazy enough 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.480
 are the ride in the train 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.170
 inflict 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.300
 while we are with a whole bunch 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.950
 Schalke fans are penned we see 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.540
 outdoors sometimes groups of long 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.190
 hair in the same direction pilgrimage 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.720
 what the spiritual elite of the north curve 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.690
 again and again to take the occasion 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 to comment on sporty appearance 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.840
 I want you guys because you fucking hippies 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.820
 roars a particularly unpleasant one 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.170
 copy 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.700
 I save the hint that it is not 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.140
 This is particularly daring to the metal 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.370
 now to bring it out there 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.790
 this through the glass nothing at all 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.530
 hear 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.570
 and also the stage itself 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.860
 is it stinks because it is 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.870
 jersey already with belly fold sweat 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.400
 sven is also soaked 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.020
 We are in a corner at the door 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 squeezed the door to suck on our 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.209
 beer cans and try our souls 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.240
 find place 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.320
 a place where better endure this 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.600
 stalingrad or the sixth circle of the 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.160
 hell 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.239
 I try not to attract attention, the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.209
 will pursue a different strategy 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.130
 as the earth between two schalala lars 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.690
 Pause to take a deep breath of beer 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.340
 to drink or again the song text in the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.170
 To go through printhead he logs on 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.280
 word 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.580
 bone dry and for each of the train 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.989
 audibly sven says that your shit 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.220
 Last time agreed from dortmund 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.110
 ass got his very nice 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.370
 good mood 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.590
 a herd of drunken bulls turns 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.170
 to us and we are two black red 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.080
 Wipes in me says something down though 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.190
 we survive the broadcast I swear 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.959
 At this moment the train and the train stops 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.280
 door opens clinging next to us sven 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.120
 Grinst shows the assembled team 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.820
 the middle finger 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.739
 jesse hughes afag schalke then he runs 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.000
 out the door and she has me with me 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.320
 hear someone roar that one 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.239
 but please pack the wixxer and all 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.010
 make and assume, first, that 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.700
 we mean it and secondly the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.459
 legs in the hand 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.320
 you speak when lingering the rap and 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.060
 leek says he laughs and we have that 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.320
 advantage of the spartans pushing the persians 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.299
 all at once through the narrow ones 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.820
 Thermophilic the railway door and stand 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.260
 pretty much in the way we're running 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.400
 us a good advantage but that is useful 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.349
 not much because we have a big one 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.790
 straight road no run along 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.290
 poorly visible branches the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.790
 we could give cover 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.260
 the royal blue mob has no problems 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.060
 his two new favorite whipping boys 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.799
 to sift and unlock 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.819
 is as I look over shoulder 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.140
 our advantage already clear 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.349
 shrunk and I can pretty much 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.030
 credible threat of violence higher right 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.409
 sven turns off i go full we run 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.760
 in a small side streets but 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.950
 also no possibility offers itself too 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.750
 Hide left sven runs into the yard 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.820
 a small three-story office building 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.049
 as she just around the corner offers space 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.880
 just behind me a bottle on the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.889
 asphalt the football you tramps it real 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.509
 seriously you want us a collar so much 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.710
 Excitement for the langweiler sport 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.669
 I think and that's a pretty 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.289
 stupid reason would be on the 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.000
 intensive care cemetery too long 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.229
 or land the cemetery or still 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.970
 worse the maiden concert too 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.990
 miss 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.430
 I just hope that the parking is not 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.110
 ends at a wall and we will be in 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.130
 but the trap is at the end of the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.780
 Parking we can turn left 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.639
 finally get lost on a bike path 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.099
 it links something more crooked and the 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.000
 meute loses sight of us 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.440
 Hopefully our pursuers are not 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.889
 local enough to get away 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.960
 to cut off 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.759
 while through a pedestrian tunnel the 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.840
 air smells violently after piss and that 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.620
 I realize that slowly me 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.240
 run out of steam 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.770
 There are three at the end of the tunnel 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.070
 possibilities would be on the right a staircase 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.900
 high 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.820
 my legs are buttery soft I hear 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.770
 already some bumpkin in the tunnel 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.449
 mob is on our heels mob rules 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.479
 I think and laugh but that does me in 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.260
 So my lungs, who do I leave it? 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.520
 suddenly fords is a whole pulk 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.120
 Metal on the way to the concert 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.650
 are 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.210
 that is very many and not a few 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.699
 are very tall and most are wearing 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.900
 many rivets on many leather straps we 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.699
 run to them and seen and to 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.349
 the troupe a type with mirrored 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:20.720
 pilot glasses look at us blankly 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.449
 Squeeze grins and says that will be cool 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.970
 people chest then he raises his beer can 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.039
 The guy does not get that horny anymore 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.020
 he'll say that and he'll hit me 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.039
 to if he also wants to toast with me 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.550
 but I got my dose at the 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.810
 lost 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.880
 he squeezes my hand full and 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.830
 Poked and drink I look over the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.970
 One step away is one shoulder 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.830
 group japanese schalke fans with 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.530
 Crimson heads collected those to us 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.659
 They may not look over 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.099
 but you have a doctor in philosophy 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.050
 comes quickly to the result that the 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.909
 hippies are clearly in the majority 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.310
 a spectacle unmotivated something 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.590
 shit peace before fast as 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.009
 necessary trollt my host sees himself 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.310
 irritated by hippies here you are where he is 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.310
 to
