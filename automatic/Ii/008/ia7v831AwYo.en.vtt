 such a small coffee table and me 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.199
 I have a lot of books that's why I show 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.199
 many books 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.629
 how nice 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.629
 through a 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.140
 and last but not least second 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.960
 question is the english at kiel 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.800
 any book title difficult to insert 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.380
 understand 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.940
 her life keeps asking me if that 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.809
 English in some book what me 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.879
 have read 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.590
 I will understand and I can 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.809
 do not answer that well because 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.190
 i do not know you language level i 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.050
 would say that I am very 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.729
 understand well english and if then one 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.950
 easy for me to understand it was book 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.420
 maybe something else for someone 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.550
 not so good at understanding English and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.590
 That's why I do not like you there 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.550
 something might say something to you 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.610
 not at all 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.520
 That's why it always looks best 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.140
 Amazon is always there and there is always one 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.759
 reading sample from most books 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.800
 there are excerpts and then you can 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.470
 Just read in and see if 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.360
 what is for you I link below 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.100
 every video actually every book what 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.590
 I'm in the camera right now 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.210
 also and therefore just look in the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.610
 info box and let you read a sample 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.160
 by that it's very important what 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 Do you study? I'm not studying anything 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.869
 more I stopped my studies 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.830
 already at the end of january 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.240
 Currently I'm looking for 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.159
 a training as a media designer 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.530
 maybe there's something in there too 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.299
 view and yes, look like that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.740
 future continues but I regret it 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.390
 not sometimes the ones aborted too 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.520
 it just was not for me 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.409
 Unfortunately I had to remember how do you think 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.450
 you last volume of determination trilogy 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.459
 yes the book is now relatively fresh 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.890
 come out and split the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.200
 Book lovers I personally do that 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.970
 not so much and if you know exactly 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.170
 why do you want mainburg 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.880
 See this day 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.530
 I take the whole book from scratch 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.310
 it's full to the rear, so it's full 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.989
 with spoilers 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.549
 if you have read the book look 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.680
 you the time to start anything in the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.459
 infobox number four you have many 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.860
 English books 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.480
 I have far more German books 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.579
 In any case, but I also have some 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.890
 english times quickly through me have 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.110
 said I say we are closer to each other 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.840
 22 English books that I have so far 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.820
 have read and I still have 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.530
 some on the job but if you have one 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.000
 video volt in which I mean you all 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.769
 English books show you that 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.780
 like to write in infobox if the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.890
 I write comments in writing 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.470
 not the infobox 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.050
 why do I always say that wrong fifth 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.560
 question do you have tips for reading english 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.600
 Books 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.880
 I really only have the same 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.280
 tips that everyone else has for it 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.590
 and a little easier, I would say 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.640
 harry potter or selection is too 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.800
 just what it was still easy i found the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.050
 tribute of panem so hunger 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.340
 I found games quite okay or reads 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.520
 a book which we already in German 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.069
 have read English that helps too 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.050
 very much and do not write each one immediately 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.400
 Vocabulary out there does not understand that 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.170
 I tried at the beginning I am two 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.370
 Come with me because of it 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.900
 someday no longer has any desire and then 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.489
 I just kept reading this way though 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.810
 if there are words that keep coming back 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.480
 show up and you just think 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.430
 only what the devil should do then 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.170
 definitely hits the word 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.459
 So of course I can do several 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.920
 words look up no problem at all 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.300
 but just try things from the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.269
 context to tap 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.950
 and then the whole thing actually works 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.209
 Of course it is very bumpy in the beginning 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.019
 but over time it will always be 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.790
 fluent and better seventh question 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.799
 Do you also write I used to go there once 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.780
 no longer active 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.060
 although I have many stories in my head 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.260
 i have so many stories in the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.209
 head maybe you know that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.430
 and I always think oh my god it would be 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.989
 the best book in the world but me 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.940
 Just do not write it because of me 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.989
 I do not think that I'm fine 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.670
 can write 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.370
 but there are so many unwritten ones 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.070
 story in my head I have mine 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.540
 time then yes short stories written 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.560
 I have never finished one 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.220
 written but I have also 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.440
 internet publishes but eighth yes 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.450
 question what is your favorite movie if 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.640
 I can only call a single movie 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.890
 then this one is here and that 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.169
 maybe tomorrow with logan 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.520
 lerman emma watson and ezra miller 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.039
 he is so great that is the filming 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.389
 from the perks of being a wallflower 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.650
 or that is my life 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.539
 or maybe the day after tomorrow 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.639
 the book is also really nice but the 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.129
 film is so perfectly realized I love 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.229
 this movie he should now a what 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.729
 you always like to shoot videos 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.009
 just turn things like this 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.110
 always because I like a lot 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.090
 can do editing in the night and 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.009
 I am always very nice because 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.389
 I really like to cut and process 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.240
 and then I like to shoot 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.520
 Monthly review and new additions because that 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.120
 something new and I like to shoot 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.099
 fancy tags so simple tags with 0 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.449
 I like to answer 8 15 questions 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.069
 not so much anymore because 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.479
 I have the feeling that I ask any question 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.999
 from this text already three times 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.249
 and that's why I like it 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.960
 rather so things like that yes the videos 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.120
 always different as well as months 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.439
 actually looking back from the principle 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 yes always the same but I can you 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.449
 always tell different things and 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.069
 yes, I like this number 10 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.930
 Since when did you start books 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.779
 together so when is a hobby 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.810
 I 've started to become aware of it 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.310
 I'm collecting so now in 2013 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.870
 I'll have it someday 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.610
 youtube videos are made but 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.710
 meanwhile it is really such a thing 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.050
 It has become a passion for collecting too 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.029
 a really real hobby and easy 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.069
 so passionate to own books 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.050
 and books to buy and that 's so im 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.020
 Last year came as that with this 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.879
 so the bug became more and more serious 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.830
 when it made me more and more fun 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.289
 and I have also seen mine 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.509
 watch that my audience watch this 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.849
 also appears fun but before 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.499
 I also always read a lot but it 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.779
 it was just like that so I read 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:16.599
 like to read but not like that is mine 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:18.039
 my favorite hobby is my favorite hobby 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.979
 It does not mean that this is mine 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.479
 dearest hobby indeed yes and before 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.069
 I always bought a book 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.529
 read it and then another book 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.169
 bought and knew something - if anything 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.740
 not but that has everything then 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.379
 the boy so developed and everything went 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.439
 the brook down the last question for 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:40.409

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.879

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.560
 I had seen for my new tattoo 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.810

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.669
 not decided in love I know 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.760
 not why anyone would ask me such 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.590
 not but it was funny so people that 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.180
 Video was extremely fun for me 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.430
 and if you have a bit of fun 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.139
