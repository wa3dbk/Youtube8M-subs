a development platform that is used to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.280 
a development platform that is used to
provide<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:33.899> dynamic<00:00:34.590> content<00:00:36.290> you

coded to take advantage of this you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.520 
coded to take advantage of this you
could<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.280> asp.net<00:00:44.870> application<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
could have an asp.net application that

you know plugs into a database that you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
you know plugs into a database that you
know<00:00:50.219> changes<00:00:50.910> based<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> results<00:00:52.110> it

finds in that database you could have it

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.260 
finds in that database you could have it
develop<00:00:55.980> content<00:00:56.370> based<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> other

example SharePoint is is a great example
of<00:01:10.950> an<00:01:11.159> asp.net<00:01:11.869> based<00:01:12.869> application<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.799> have

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of an asp.net based application you have

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.640 
of an asp.net based application you have
a<00:01:13.979> database<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.650> content

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
a database back there that the content

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
a database back there that the content
is<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.159> stored<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.229> can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
is the stored in and then that we can

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310 
is the stored in and then that we can
actually<00:01:19.590> go<00:01:19.830> through<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.970> our<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
actually go through and have our you

actually go through and have our you
know<00:01:22.350> our<00:01:23.810> actual<00:01:24.810> experience<00:01:25.380> change<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
know our actual experience change and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.969 
know our actual experience change and
update<00:01:26.040> depending<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
square one here is the asp.net service

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.609 
square one here is the asp.net service
now<00:01:40.439> by<00:01:40.799> default<00:01:40.970> asp.net<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:43.020> enabled

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to install it remember as we said way

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.740 
to install it remember as we said way
back<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.680> beginning<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.659> when<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
back at the beginning here when you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.410 
back at the beginning here when you
install<00:01:51.780> roles<00:01:52.470> into<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.549> only<00:01:53.880> those<00:01:54.119> roles

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
install roles into is only those roles

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.980 
install roles into is only those roles
that<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.610> needed<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> provide

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that are that are needed to provide

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990 
that are that are needed to provide
static<00:01:58.560> content<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.610> which<00:01:59.790> means

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
static content are there which means

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
static content are there which means
it's<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> very<00:02:00.240> minimal<00:02:00.689> installation<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it's a very minimal installation so you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's a very minimal installation so you
can<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.549> HTML<00:02:02.700> pages<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.110> can't<00:02:04.439> get

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
can get HTML pages but you can't get

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.080 
can get HTML pages but you can't get
anything<00:02:04.710> else<00:02:04.860> beyond<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> without<00:02:05.700> going

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
anything else beyond that without going

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.369 
anything else beyond that without going
in<00:02:06.240> server<00:02:06.479> manager<00:02:07.049> or<00:02:07.459> package<00:02:08.459> manager<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
installing the module for asp.net so you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.800 
installing the module for asp.net so you
have<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.410> add

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
have to add

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
additional roles service to make this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.770 
additional roles service to make this
work<00:02:15.819> in<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.390> case<00:02:16.630> we're<00:02:16.870> adding<00:02:16.959> asp.net

running<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.550> way<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.790> needs<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.090> be<00:04:15.180> you've

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
running the way it needs to be you've

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.460 
running the way it needs to be you've
determined<00:04:15.660> with<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:15.990> production

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
determined with the production

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.229 
determined with the production
requirements<00:04:17.130> are<00:04:17.280> you've<00:04:17.579> planned<00:04:17.910> for<00:04:18.150> all

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
requirements are you've planned for all

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.090 
requirements are you've planned for all
that<00:04:18.450> now<00:04:19.200> what<00:04:19.410> you're<00:04:19.560> doing<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:19.950> you're

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
that now what you're doing is you're

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.039 
that now what you're doing is you're
planning<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.670> deployment<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.390> that<00:04:21.810> into

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
planning the deployment of that into

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.050 
planning the deployment of that into
production<00:04:22.410> now<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.190> idea<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.700> you're<00:04:23.940> taking

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
production now the idea is you're taking

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.690 
production now the idea is you're taking
all<00:04:24.300> information<00:04:24.810> gleaned<00:04:25.170> from<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.830> robust

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
all information gleaned from a robust

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.240 
all information gleaned from a robust
testing<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.540> development<00:04:27.870> process<00:04:28.250> over

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
testing and development process over

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.440 
testing and development process over
into<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:30.350> production<00:04:31.350> by<00:04:31.770> state<00:04:32.250> by<00:04:32.520> figuring

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
into a production by state by figuring

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.090 
into a production by state by figuring
out<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.630> stages<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.110> phases<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.830> the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
out the stages and phases of the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.940 
out the stages and phases of the
deployment<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.900> then<00:04:36.900> moving<00:04:37.260> things<00:04:37.470> over

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
deployment and then moving things over

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.340 
deployment and then moving things over
as<00:04:38.730> required<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:39.600> we're<00:04:39.870> going<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.050> we<00:04:40.200> are

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
as required so we're going to we are

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.970 
as required so we're going to we are
seeing<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.919> actually<00:04:41.490> here
