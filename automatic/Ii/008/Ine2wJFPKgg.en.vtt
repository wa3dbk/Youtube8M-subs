to<00:02:16.700> travel<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.300> yeah<00:02:18.170> most<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.709> level<00:02:18.980> I

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
to travel so yeah most of this level I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.520 
to travel so yeah most of this level I
just<00:02:19.400> used<00:02:19.610> my<00:02:19.700> wrench<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:21.050> kill<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.380> little

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
just used my wrench to kill the little

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.949 
just used my wrench to kill the little
ones<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.090> mentally<00:02:23.090> only<00:02:23.390> get<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> bigger

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
ones but mentally only get to the bigger

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.729 
ones but mentally only get to the bigger
robots<00:02:24.610> they're<00:02:25.610> not<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.880> big<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.540> do<00:02:27.380> use

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
robots they're not that big but I do use

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.440 
robots they're not that big but I do use
the<00:02:27.860> bomb<00:02:28.100> glove<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:30.440> bungle<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.489> we<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.209> see

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the bomb glove but bungle can we you see

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.979 
the bomb glove but bungle can we you see
but<00:02:33.160> with<00:02:34.160> more<00:02:34.400> than<00:02:34.520> one<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
but with more than one but this is the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.900 
but with more than one but this is the
feature<00:02:36.650> where<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.069> throw<00:02:37.489> your<00:02:37.700> inch

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
feature where you can throw your inch

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.809 
feature where you can throw your inch
and<00:02:38.560> there's<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.650> lot<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:39.860> cool<00:02:40.280> moves<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.670> can

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
and there's a lot of cool moves you can

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.509 
and there's a lot of cool moves you can
do<00:02:41.060> even<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.720> your<00:02:42.050> wrench<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.769> the

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
do even on your wrench like that the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.009 
do even on your wrench like that the
triple<00:02:43.760> strike<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> comment<00:02:44.810> straight

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
triple strike and a comment straight

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.970 
triple strike and a comment straight
like<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.989> as<00:02:47.989> we<00:02:48.200> see<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.590> seesaw

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
like that and as we see a seesaw

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.020 
like that and as we see a seesaw
throwing<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> wrench<00:02:49.940> move<00:02:50.300> but<00:02:51.819> most<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
throwing a wrench move but most of the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.300 
throwing a wrench move but most of the
time<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.300> just<00:02:53.360> need<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> single<00:02:54.410> sweep<00:02:54.709> or<00:02:55.010> two

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
time you just need a single sweep or two

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.610 
time you just need a single sweep or two
for<00:02:55.700> enemies<00:02:57.519> but<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.989> crate<00:02:59.989> sort<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.470> what

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
for enemies but the crate sort of what

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.080 
for enemies but the crate sort of what
what<00:03:00.890> give<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> money<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:01.760> there's<00:03:02.000> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
what give you the money and there's a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.400 
what give you the money and there's a
lot<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.299> them<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.720> first<00:03:02.930> level<00:03:03.140> which<00:03:03.380> is

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
lot of them in the first level which is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.910 
lot of them in the first level which is
why<00:03:03.709> most<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.430> video<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:06.230> quite<00:03:06.500> long<00:03:06.709> but

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
why most of this video is quite long but

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.449 
why most of this video is quite long but
if<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.400> video<00:03:08.500> hadn't<00:03:09.500> had<00:03:09.680> at<00:03:09.830> me<00:03:09.980> smashing

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
if this video hadn't had at me smashing

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.580 
if this video hadn't had at me smashing
all<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.670> crates<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.380> would<00:03:12.560> probably

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
all the crates and that would probably

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.650 
all the crates and that would probably
be<00:03:13.010> only<00:03:13.190> be<00:03:13.459> about<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.760> minute<00:03:14.120> long<00:03:14.299> because

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
be only be about a minute long because

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.490 
be only be about a minute long because
it<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:14.959> actually<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.500> very<00:03:15.650> short<00:03:16.579> level

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
it is actually a very short level

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.199 
it is actually a very short level
because<00:03:18.500> I'm<00:03:19.160> getting<00:03:19.459> nearly<00:03:19.700> up<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.180> a

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
because I'm getting nearly up to a

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.009 
because I'm getting nearly up to a
thousand<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:22.160> next<00:03:24.940> weapon<00:03:26.019> it's

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
thousand so and the next weapon it's

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.170 
thousand so and the next weapon it's
2,500<00:03:27.739> in<00:03:28.340> level<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.959> pyro<00:03:30.200> acid<00:03:30.680> oh

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
2,500 in level to the pyro acid oh

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.060 
2,500 in level to the pyro acid oh
that's<00:03:32.180> good<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:33.290> actually<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:33.829> price

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
that's good and is actually good price

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.710 
that's good and is actually good price
but<00:03:34.489> it's<00:03:34.760> kind<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.000> run<00:03:35.150> because<00:03:35.480> in<00:03:35.630> the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
but it's kind of run because in the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.009 
but it's kind of run because in the
second<00:03:36.109> game<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.440> would<00:03:36.500> be<00:03:36.650> about<00:03:37.329> 7,500<00:03:38.329> so

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
second game that would be about 7,500 so

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.970 
second game that would be about 7,500 so
I<00:03:39.049> is<00:03:39.200> here<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.590> game<00:03:39.769> bolts<00:03:40.280> with<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:42.320> the

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
I is here to game bolts with the in the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.310 
I is here to game bolts with the in the
later<00:03:43.280> games<00:03:43.549> because<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:43.940> bolt<00:03:44.780> multipliers

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
later games because of bolt multipliers

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.380 
later games because of bolt multipliers
and<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.829> think<00:03:46.640> it's<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:47.090> bit<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.570> marketing

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
and I think it's a bit like marketing

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.050 
and I think it's a bit like marketing
the<00:03:49.960> more<00:03:50.170> about<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.620> get<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:51.069> get<00:03:51.250> us<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.730> few

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the more about you get you get us a few

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.360 
the more about you get you get us a few
added<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.630> there<00:03:53.380> are<00:03:53.470> different<00:03:53.830> colors<00:03:53.980> in

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
added on there are different colors in

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.490 
added on there are different colors in
different<00:03:54.400> games<00:03:54.910> but<00:03:55.270> and<00:03:55.990> when<00:03:56.170> this<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.410> a

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
different games but and when this is a

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.070 
different games but and when this is a
bit<00:03:56.650> where<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.920> bomb<00:03:57.130> Goff<00:03:57.630> starts<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.720> get<00:03:58.840> in

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
bit where the bomb Goff starts to get in

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.840 
bit where the bomb Goff starts to get in
use<00:03:59.550> but<00:04:00.550> this<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.450> those<00:04:01.630> robots<00:04:02.110> and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
use but this is one of those robots and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.220 
use but this is one of those robots and
all<00:04:03.850> they<00:04:04.000> do<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.150> shoot<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.720> spot<00:04:05.110> of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
all they do is shoot the spot of

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.980 
all they do is shoot the spot of
electricity<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.220> shouldn't<00:04:06.550> really<00:04:06.790> be

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
electricity so you shouldn't really be

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.970 
electricity so you shouldn't really be
having<00:04:07.990> much<00:04:08.080> trouble<00:04:08.470> with<00:04:08.590> them<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:08.800> then

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
having much trouble with them but then

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.770 
having much trouble with them but then
three<00:04:09.430> of<00:04:09.550> them<00:04:09.670> all<00:04:09.820> run<00:04:10.120> around<00:04:10.360> there<00:04:10.600> and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
three of them all run around there and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.870 
three of them all run around there and
since<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.590> bit<00:04:11.740> where<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.040> bongo<00:04:12.430> can<00:04:12.640> kill

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
since a bit where the bongo can kill

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.210 
since a bit where the bongo can kill
more<00:04:13.060> than<00:04:13.240> one<00:04:13.390> because<00:04:14.050> you<00:04:14.320> God<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.100> can

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
more than one because you God you can

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.220 
more than one because you God you can
kill<00:04:15.400> all<00:04:15.430> three<00:04:15.550> but<00:04:16.030> most<00:04:16.900> it's<00:04:17.079> how<00:04:17.169> you

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
kill all three but most it's how you

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.099
