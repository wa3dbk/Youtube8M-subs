00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this scheme when I pretty much did was I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
this scheme when I pretty much did was I
stuck<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.630> wall<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> ask<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> wall

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
stuck to the wall I can I ask the wall

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.539 
stuck to the wall I can I ask the wall
the<00:01:52.860> whole<00:01:53.009> time<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.750> aside<00:01:55.200> from

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
the whole time and you know aside from

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.389 
the whole time and you know aside from
painkiller<00:01:56.549> faggots<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:58.680> no<00:01:59.009> offense<00:01:59.280> if

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
and I'm very vulnerable at this point

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.110 
and I'm very vulnerable at this point
because<00:03:04.680> rust<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.160> such<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> small<00:03:05.640> map<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
because rust is such a small map and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.940 
because rust is such a small map and
somebody<00:03:06.360> could<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.660> chuck<00:03:07.079> assem<00:03:07.440> tax<00:03:07.709> back

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
somebody could just chuck assem tax back

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.900 
somebody could just chuck assem tax back
there<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.370> me<00:03:09.019> i<00:03:10.280> feel<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.310> i<00:03:11.700> wasn't

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910
