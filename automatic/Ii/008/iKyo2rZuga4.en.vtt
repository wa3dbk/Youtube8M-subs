 summary theories and chapter reviews 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.040
 we should talk very interesting but not 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.590
 with so many theories but with many 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.720
 curiosities but before starting I wish 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.060

 freelancer transfer so good people 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.410
 we started and good people finally saw 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.680
 the chapter we need to talk about the new 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.649
 cap recently released in the USA and I can 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.020
 epic saying very very epic so good 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.510
 people of review with more details 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.759
 relevant theories and curiosities that 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.799
 come out in that chapter the first theory 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.870
 and each time it takes more strength is that of 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.970
 onion well the new intro there 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.400
 a point where people like that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.070
 about or rather onion sees near the 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.350
 people then onion runs this we 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.480
 gives a few chances that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.670
 is either planning something or 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.010
 may not, although frankly I do 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.650
 I think this is a villain and it can be 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.870
 then in the episode the return or more 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.970
 well in prison escape you see that one 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.160
 of the fragments of the ship destroyed the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.740
 yellow tail boat thing that surely 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.240
 left without work a way out time motive 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 whereby this may be 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.070
 trying to get revenge and for that reason we 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.750
 shows in the next intro theory I know 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.940
 that I said that I would only talk about 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.400
 we need to talk but I will also speak 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.710
 of we should be together and is that in this 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.930
 episode were revealed more things like by 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.000
 example is again being confirmed 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.520
 the theory that I mentioned to you some time ago 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.590
 peridot will be as a main villain in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.600
 second season and it is that in this 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.729
 chapter turns out that it fell where 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.250
 many think kindergarten 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.590
 one of the most interesting points of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.450
 this chapter is that apparently peridot 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.910
 try to reactivate the kindergarten 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.489
 but at the moment pearl counts 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.870
 how is this she also says no 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.390
 will allow that to come back 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.099
 another open point for the theory occurs 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.560
 I told you about the insurrection 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.110
 of the possible nursery event which 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.150
 revived now well in this chapter it 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 reveals how people give life to others 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.620
 gems and this is through the process of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.690
 resuscitation although you've seen my fit 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.849
 coliseum you'll see that I wrote that the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.010
 loggers drilled the earth and 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.290
 they supplied energy so that the gem 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.110
 live then apparently it is not so wrong 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.599
 just that the official form shows it that way 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.120
 the drill pierces the earth and injects 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.519
 an energy discharge then the drill 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.620
 it comes out and in a matter of days the earth is 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.810
 opened by the gem as indicated 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.310
 amethyst when he said that one day she 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.650
 came out of that hole in the wall 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.109
 future theories based on this chapter 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.390
 I feel that peridot and jazz but well 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.909
 will merge another theory is that I feel 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.250
 and I would bet my hat that lost no 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.650
 It will only be the main villain because I'm still 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.629
 firm in my theory but I think that 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.819
 by the end of this season a 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.769
 Invasion of stolen spheres will be given and with 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.810
 that event I feel that a 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.000
 kind of war I also feel that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.740
 peridot will contact the mother planet to 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.020
 start the reconstruction of the 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.330
 of children or at one time take the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.400
 planet earth although I feel that first 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.740
 they will contact you to send another gem to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.410
 to repair the mega portal of the garden 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.450
 children another curious fact is how garnett 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.400
 reacts to those very hands 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.800
 similar to the secret squad chapter 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
 or steven and is that these hands are 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.390
 fragments of gems in this episode 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.120
 such fragments oblige garnett to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.340
 merge but not for being bad but 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.510
 who are apparently alone and see 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.880
 Garnett an ideal being 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.160
 besides garnett looks sad when he sees 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.350
 said fragments once enclosed 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.720
 she feels what it is like to be alone 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.790
 maybe words spoken by sapphire before 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.070
 of knowing ruby another remarkable fact 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.530
 is that we very possibly see ruby 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.960
 sapphire or in a special episode or 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.240
 in a fight however this still does not 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.280
 is confirmed however he theorized that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.590
 if they will appear then more and more are given 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.810
 tracks about a fusion by 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.240
 from garnett now yes let's move on to the episode 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.580
 we must talk it looks like I mentioned in my 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.740
 previous video arrows more caramel 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.020
 greg and not only that but 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.950
 finally a fusion of rose appears 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.170
 with pearl 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.750
 of this merger is that despite having 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.850
 four eyes only has two hands as 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.220
 which unleashes the idea of ​​the supreme gem 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.740
 if rose fused with a gem gives two 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.870
 hands with two gems will give four and with 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.090
 three will give six number of hands of the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.130
 supreme gem confirming that she does 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.620
 merged with pearl garnett and amethyst 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.540
 another important point that you see here is 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.090
 the attitude of the gems an attitude 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.860
 friendly and more the amethyst well adds to 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.990
 which even left this 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.120
 park your truck in the temple to 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.850
 which one could say that after 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.710
 their pregnancy they had some hatred or 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.140
 grimace to greg for his fault to his 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.090
 beloved leader and almost mother disappeared in 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.000
 this episode did not reveal the name of 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.920
 the fusion of pearl and rose sn however what 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.200
 curious is that apparently when pearl 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.090
 merges with some other pearl gem is 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.070
 who controls the mind for this 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.110
 would show that the will of pearl does not 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.210
 it's only bigger but it's stronger than 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.340
 the one of the others also it is seen that pearl 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.020
 He not entirely accepted as is greg 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.600
 I constantly asked him if 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.400
 he would come back and even mocked him 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.890
 when he asked if he could 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.760
 merge with the gems to which pearl 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.920
 told him not to 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.260
 because he was not a gem then with 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.110
 help from garnett believes he creates a dance 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.510
 and believe me it looks great as greg invites 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.610
 rose and dancing to it and end the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.800
 kisses after showing us everything 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.200
 show to leave open-mouthed 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.210
 rose to then tell him why not 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.280
 they merged after that rose him 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.080
 answers but tells him that what both 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.180
 they did is perhaps greater than the merger 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.400
 at that moment rose indicates that he feels 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.380
 nervous and then Greg takes her hand 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.810
 and tells him that he feels the same then 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.360
 pearl very angry rays complains of 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.250
 this episode does not leave many theories of 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.770
 done I thought rose would fight 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.050
 to show the fusion but not between 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.720
 everything great is the song of the beginning 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.300
 very very cool hopefully when they bend it 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.640
 do not listen so badly and that's when 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.620
 they doubled the song louder than you did 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.810
 I liked it but there were fans songs that 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.730
 they sang or rather they had better lyrics 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.980
 that the official song although yes I 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.350
 he liked the prison escape song 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.750
 then as we apparently saw the gems 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.060
 can play instruments that includes 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.160
 amethyst which surely did not have 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.480
 great musical knowledge without mebargo 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.080
 he plays excellent 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.970
 another curious fact is that in that episode 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.190
 accidentally greg yells at rose 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.470
 Well, he thinks that Rose just wants him 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.540
 be a way of life of the universe thing 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.900
 said by pearl pearl because you are so 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.510
 bad to x xd xd xy good people that 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.880
 it was all if the video you liked to share it 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.740
 subscribe and most of all have a great 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.740
 day their company schlöder man spoke to them
