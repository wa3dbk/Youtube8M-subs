00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
Pierce which is not super practical so

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.070 
Pierce which is not super practical so
better<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.769> set<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.970> standing<00:00:24.779> reset

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
better to set it up the standing reset

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.279 
better to set it up the standing reset
is<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.769> last<00:00:25.980> hit<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> medium<00:00:26.789> kick

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:41.060 

yep<00:00:38.660> here's<00:00:39.660> Marduk<00:00:40.050> his<00:00:40.350> only<00:00:40.680> ground<00:00:40.890> bounce

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
yep here's Marduk his only ground bounce

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.979 
yep here's Marduk his only ground bounce
is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> jump<00:00:41.760> brown<00:00:41.879> house<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> nice

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
is the jump brown house which is nice

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.270 
is the jump brown house which is nice
for<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.350> things<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.739> doesn't<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.010> set

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
for some things but doesn't really set

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.729

up<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.670> toward<00:00:45.480> fierce<00:00:45.780> which<00:00:46.140> has<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> whiff

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
up the toward fierce which has to whiff

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.459 
up the toward fierce which has to whiff
then<00:00:47.579> our<00:00:48.090> star<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.660> far<00:00:48.809> fear<00:00:48.989> such<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
then our star just far fear such as to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.799 
then our star just far fear such as to
whiff<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.489> actual<00:00:50.700> reset<00:00:51.120> part<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
whiff then the actual reset part is the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
whiff then the actual reset part is the
down<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.530> punches<00:00:52.920> afterward<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> sagat's<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
down to punches afterward and sagat's is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.709 
down to punches afterward and sagat's is
tiger<00:00:57.899> knee<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.030> only<00:01:00.180> ground<00:01:00.420> balance

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
tiger knee so that's only ground balance

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
tiger knee so that's only ground balance
is<00:01:01.039> overhead<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.489> hits<00:01:02.879> crouching<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
is overhead that hits crouching so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
is overhead that hits crouching so
that's<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.140> super<00:01:04.379> practical<00:01:04.619> rather<00:01:05.549> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that's not super practical rather just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.899 
that's not super practical rather just

do that pongs is definitely one of the
best<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.080> medium<00:01:13.350> kick<00:01:13.470> meeting

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770

the hits I haven't found one for Rufus
but<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:45.270> looking<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.720> he<00:01:45.960> has<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> bunch

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
but I'm looking because he has a bunch

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
but I'm looking because he has a bunch
of<00:01:46.619> specials<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.840> multiple<00:01:48.840> hits<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.560> our

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
of specials that do multiple hits on our

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249 
of specials that do multiple hits on our
own<00:01:49.799> maybe<00:01:50.009> I'll<00:01:50.130> find<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.570> want

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.130 
own maybe I'll find one but if you want
to<00:01:52.320> look<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.439> stuff<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.780> seems<00:01:54.990> like

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to look for stuff to just it seems like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
to look for stuff to just it seems like
you<00:01:55.170> either<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.070> real<00:01:56.700> capture

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you either want to look for real capture

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.179 
you either want to look for real capture
states<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:57.840> he<00:01:58.409> extract<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> punch<00:01:59.009> or
