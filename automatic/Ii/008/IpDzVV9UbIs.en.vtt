in<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.270> course<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:34.700> know<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.120> see

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in here of course you know you can see

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.470 
in here of course you know you can see
everything<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.020> carbon<00:00:37.410> fiber<00:00:38.360> some<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
everything is carbon fiber some of the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.700 
everything is carbon fiber some of the
first<00:00:39.660> things<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.989> notice<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.469> course<00:00:40.559> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
first things you notice of course you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
first things you notice of course you
gotta<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> Racing<00:00:41.489> foot<00:00:41.730> box<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
gotta like a Racing foot box the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.760 
gotta like a Racing foot box the
steering<00:00:43.170> column

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
steering column

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
steering column
you've<00:00:44.489> got<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> shifter<00:00:45.149> right<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you've got the shifter right here so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.209 
you've got the shifter right here so
this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> actually<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> grab<00:00:46.860> gears

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
this is actually how you grab gears

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.299 
this is actually how you grab gears
that's<00:00:48.210> first<00:00:48.510> gear<00:00:48.649> second<00:00:49.649> gear<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.129> on

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that's first gear second gear and so on

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
that's first gear second gear and so on
and<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and then you go down like that it's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.939 
and then you go down like that it's
pretty<00:00:52.020> awesome<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.680> keep

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
pretty awesome you can actually keep

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.790 
pretty awesome you can actually keep
your<00:00:53.070> foot<00:00:53.280> full<00:00:53.550> throttle<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.530> grab<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
your foot full throttle and grab the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000 
your foot full throttle and grab the
gear<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.629> uh<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:58.469> doesn't<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.920> an

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
gear and it is uh it doesn't have an

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
gear and it is uh it doesn't have an
electronic<00:00:59.460> shifting<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.910> anything<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
electronic shifting or anything but it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
electronic shifting or anything but it
will<00:01:00.600> misfire<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> couple<00:01:01.800> cylinders<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.430> soon

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
will misfire a couple cylinders as soon

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
will misfire a couple cylinders as soon
as<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> pull<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> drops

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
as you pull on this and so it drops

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 
as you pull on this and so it drops
right<00:01:04.320> into<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> next<00:01:04.949> gear<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.460> awesome<00:01:05.939> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
right into the next gear so awesome this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
right into the next gear so awesome this
is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.140> handbrake<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.100> does<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
is the handbrake so what this does is it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
is the handbrake so what this does is it
opens<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> center<00:01:10.290> diff<00:01:10.500> allows<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> back

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
opens up the center diff allows the back

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
opens up the center diff allows the back
tires<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.000> lock<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.080> in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
tires to lock up so then when you go in

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
tires to lock up so then when you go in
a<00:01:13.229> sharp<00:01:13.500> corner<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.100> turn<00:01:14.250> pull<00:01:14.939> that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
a sharp corner you can turn pull that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
a sharp corner you can turn pull that
just<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.509> bit<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> car<00:01:16.170> locates<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just a little bit in the car locates and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.109 
just a little bit in the car locates and
then<00:01:16.920> boom<00:01:17.159> you're<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.580> back<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> gas

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
then boom you're right back on the gas

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.320 
then boom you're right back on the gas
now<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> all-wheel<00:01:20.189> drive<00:01:20.490> car<00:01:20.790> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
now this is a all-wheel drive car it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
now this is a all-wheel drive car it's
not<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> front<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.350> rear<00:01:22.530> wheel<00:01:22.740> drive<00:01:22.979> all

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
not the front to rear wheel drive all

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
not the front to rear wheel drive all
four<00:01:23.549> tires<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.119> doing<00:01:24.330> their<00:01:24.450> job<00:01:24.659> which

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
four tires are doing their job which

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800 
four tires are doing their job which
helps<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> accelerate<00:01:26.570> especially<00:01:27.570> from<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
helps it accelerate especially from a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
helps it accelerate especially from a
standstill<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.350> about<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> two-second<00:01:29.939> zero<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
standstill in about a two-second zero to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.030 
standstill in about a two-second zero to
sixty<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.409> two<00:01:31.619> point<00:01:31.890> two

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
sixty it's actually two point two

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
sixty it's actually two point two
seconds<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.549> insane<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.930> acceleration<00:01:34.619> off

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
seconds it's insane the acceleration off

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.719 
seconds it's insane the acceleration off
the<00:01:34.829> line<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.369> awesome

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the line is just awesome

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.450 
the line is just awesome
so<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> switches<00:01:36.479> we've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:37.189> this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so the switches we've got this is the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
so the switches we've got this is the
main<00:01:38.640> switch<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
main switch as you can see that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
main switch as you can see that
basically<00:01:41.340> turns<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> power<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.119> for

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
basically turns the power on for

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.660 
basically turns the power on for
everything

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
everything

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.719 
everything
you've<00:01:43.850> got<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> ignition<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:46.280> once<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
you've got the ignition and once the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.969 
you've got the ignition and once the
ignition<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.390> then<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.259> start<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.770> up

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
ignition is on then you can start it up

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.160 
ignition is on then you can start it up
here<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.670> see<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.090> gear<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:50.960> in

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
here you can see the gear that I'm in

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.429 
here you can see the gear that I'm in
and<00:01:51.409> now<00:01:51.890> it's<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.189> number<00:01:52.700> two<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.180> can<00:01:54.049> go<00:01:54.200> back

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
and now it's a number two I can go back

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.550 
and now it's a number two I can go back
down<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.860> first<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:55.490> there's<00:01:55.939> neutral<00:01:56.560> then

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
down to first and there's neutral then

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.180 
down to first and there's neutral then
you<00:01:57.649> have<00:01:57.799> some<00:01:58.369> fans<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.659> ALS<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.740> actually

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
you have some fans this ALS is actually

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.749 
you have some fans this ALS is actually
any<00:02:01.549> leg<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.600> any<00:02:02.869> leg<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:04.009> car<00:02:04.310> runs<00:02:04.610> a

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
any leg and any leg this car runs a

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.730 
any leg and any leg this car runs a
turbocharger<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.690> makes<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.960> huge<00:02:06.289> amount<00:02:06.470> of

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
turbocharger that makes a huge amount of

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.249 
turbocharger that makes a huge amount of
boost<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.310> where<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.270> hear<00:02:08.420> like<00:02:08.630> turbo<00:02:09.050> lag

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
boost and where you hear like turbo lag

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.960 
boost and where you hear like turbo lag
happening<00:02:09.800> in<00:02:09.920> turbocharged<00:02:10.429> cars

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
happening in turbocharged cars

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.610 
happening in turbocharged cars
this<00:02:11.360> one<00:02:11.510> has<00:02:11.660> none<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.500> has

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
this one has none of that because it has

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.710 
this one has none of that because it has
an<00:02:12.739> any<00:02:12.980> lag<00:02:13.250> system<00:02:13.730> whenever<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.360> lift<00:02:14.569> off

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
an any lag system whenever you lift off

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.809 
an any lag system whenever you lift off
the<00:02:14.840> gas<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.590> essentially<00:02:15.980> shoots<00:02:16.430> flame

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
the gas it essentially shoots flame

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.449 
the gas it essentially shoots flame
through<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.480> turbo<00:02:17.870> keeping<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.440> spinning<00:02:18.830> so

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
through the turbo keeping it spinning so

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.680 
through the turbo keeping it spinning so
that<00:02:19.489> when<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:19.850> back<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.480> throttle

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
that when you go back to the throttle

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.949 
that when you go back to the throttle
you<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.080> maximum<00:02:21.500> power<00:02:21.830> instantly

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you have maximum power instantly

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.960 
you have maximum power instantly
ridiculous<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.250> awesome<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.790> course

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
ridiculous it is it is awesome of course

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.580 
ridiculous it is it is awesome of course
there's<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.420> safety<00:02:26.630> stuff<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
there's all the safety stuff and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.130 
there's all the safety stuff and
everything<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.900> cool<00:02:29.900> stuff

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
everything like that but the cool stuff

everything like that but the cool stuff
in<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.410> machine<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:31.250> all<00:02:31.519> about<00:02:31.819> speed<00:02:32.269> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
in this machine is all about speed and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.780 
in this machine is all about speed and
power<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.260> gotta<00:02:33.440> say<00:02:33.680> it's<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
power and I gotta say it's one of the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.690 
power and I gotta say it's one of the
most<00:02:35.540> wicked<00:02:36.200> evil<00:02:36.410> little<00:02:36.950> machines<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.580> have

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
most wicked evil little machines I have

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.030 
most wicked evil little machines I have
ever<00:02:38.000> driven<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.540> my<00:02:38.660> life<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.560> love<00:02:39.799> it

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.479 

under<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.849> hood<00:02:43.530> where<00:02:44.530> our<00:02:44.680> normal<00:02:45.040> Fiesta

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
under the hood where our normal Fiesta

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.130 
under the hood where our normal Fiesta
has<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.790> engine<00:02:45.939> turned<00:02:46.329> this<00:02:46.540> way<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.989> has

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
has the engine turned this way this has

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.699 
has the engine turned this way this has
actually<00:02:47.319> been<00:02:47.530> turned<00:02:47.799> longitudinally<00:02:48.700> so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
actually been turned longitudinally so

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.490 
actually been turned longitudinally so
it<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.340> transmission<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.239> way<00:02:52.930> back<00:02:53.230> there

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
it the transmission is way back there

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.509 
it the transmission is way back there
and<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.799> gives<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.069> better<00:02:54.189> weight

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
and it gives a better weight

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.880 
and it gives a better weight
distribution<00:02:55.290> we've<00:02:56.290> got<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.439> big<00:02:56.650> giant

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
distribution we've got a big giant

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.399 
distribution we've got a big giant
Garrett<00:02:57.400> turbo<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.079> is<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
Garrett turbo and then this is the

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.759 
Garrett turbo and then this is the
intercooler<00:02:59.859> up<00:03:00.519> here<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.390> huge<00:03:01.900> cooler<00:03:02.439> is

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
intercooler up here this huge cooler is

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.099 
intercooler up here this huge cooler is
the<00:03:02.950> intercooler<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.359> duratec<00:03:04.810> Ford

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
the intercooler that is the duratec Ford

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.369 
the intercooler that is the duratec Ford
2-liter<00:03:05.620> Fallsburg<00:03:06.549> has<00:03:07.030> built<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:08.200> run

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
2-liter Fallsburg has built it up to run

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.250 
2-liter Fallsburg has built it up to run
almost<00:03:08.709> 600<00:03:09.549> horsepower<00:03:09.849> from<00:03:10.569> two<00:03:10.870> liters

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
almost 600 horsepower from two liters

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.860 
almost 600 horsepower from two liters
but<00:03:12.099> there's<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:12.939> a<00:03:13.000> lot<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.239> room<00:03:13.480> up<00:03:13.659> here

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
but there's not a lot of room up here

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.319 
but there's not a lot of room up here
now<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:15.250> radiators<00:03:15.700> actually<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.239> the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
now so the radiators actually in the

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.819 
now so the radiators actually in the
back<00:03:16.510> we<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.780> go<00:03:16.989> take<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.260> look<00:03:17.409> here<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.739> if

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
back we can go take a look here so if

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.009 
back we can go take a look here so if
you<00:03:20.919> take<00:03:21.069> a<00:03:21.099> look<00:03:21.280> back<00:03:21.459> here<00:03:21.629> or<00:03:22.629> normally

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
you take a look back here or normally

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.020 
you take a look back here or normally
you<00:03:23.109> might<00:03:23.139> find<00:03:23.560> some<00:03:24.310> back<00:03:24.489> seats<00:03:24.819> or

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
you might find some back seats or

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.000 
you might find some back seats or
something<00:03:25.139> here<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.379> see<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> radiator

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
something here you can see the radiator

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.920 
something here you can see the radiator
and<00:03:27.159> a<00:03:27.220> big<00:03:27.400> massive<00:03:27.730> fan<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.659> helps<00:03:28.870> with

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and a big massive fan so it helps with

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.819 
and a big massive fan so it helps with
weight<00:03:29.139> distribution

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
weight distribution

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.949 
weight distribution
it<00:03:30.280> keeps<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.669> radiator<00:03:31.030> protected<00:03:31.629> from<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
it keeps the radiator protected from the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.479 
it keeps the radiator protected from the
rocks<00:03:32.169> and<00:03:32.409> mud<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:33.220> kicked<00:03:33.489> up<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:35.489> it

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
rocks and mud that get kicked up and it

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.000 
rocks and mud that get kicked up and it
makes<00:03:36.669> it<00:03:36.819> extra<00:03:37.120> hot<00:03:37.299> inside<00:03:37.689> the<00:03:37.840> car<00:03:38.049> just

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
makes it extra hot inside the car just

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.550 
makes it extra hot inside the car just
has<00:03:39.159> like<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.430> little<00:03:39.639> added<00:03:39.879> bonus<00:03:40.599> it<00:03:40.750> if<00:03:41.470> you

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
has like a little added bonus it if you

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.960 
has like a little added bonus it if you
look<00:03:41.739> underneath<00:03:42.040> here<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.519> see<00:03:45.700> all<00:03:45.849> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
look underneath here you can see all the
