ears<00:01:13.939> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:15.659> pointy<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
ears you can see how pointy it is at the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.310 
ears you can see how pointy it is at the
end<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> chibi

end but for the chibi

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.280 
end but for the chibi
it's<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.930> not

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it's it has to be like really not

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's it has to be like really not
pointing<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.930> see<00:01:25.229> these

pointing at all so as you can see these

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
pointing at all so as you can see these

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
are kind of like smooth edges instead of

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.969 
are kind of like smooth edges instead of
pointy<00:01:28.860> ones<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.740> make

the<00:03:01.550> clay<00:03:01.760> down<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.360> then<00:03:02.480> kind<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:02.870> make<00:03:03.020> a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the clay down and then kind of make a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:12.430 
the clay down and then kind of make a
triangle<00:03:03.740> shape<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:10.730> here<00:03:11.440> and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
triangle shape like this right here and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.130 
triangle shape like this right here and
stick<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.850> where<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.060> nose<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.390> but<00:03:14.959> be

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
stick it on to where the nose is but be

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.340 
stick it on to where the nose is but be
careful<00:03:15.680> not<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.730> make<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.150> edges<00:03:17.390> too<00:03:17.930> sharp

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
careful not to make the edges too sharp

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.560 
careful not to make the edges too sharp
on<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.830> nose<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:20.500> now<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.180> make<00:03:23.360> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
on the nose so now I have to make the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.759 
on the nose so now I have to make the
eyes<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.910> eyes<00:03:26.090> are<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.890> be<00:03:29.769> like

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
eyes so the eyes are going to be like

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.240 
eyes so the eyes are going to be like
take<00:03:31.310> two<00:03:31.670> black<00:03:32.510> pieces<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:35.420> this

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
take two black pieces like this

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.740 
take two black pieces like this
generally<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.760> same<00:03:37.970> size<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:40.120> make<00:03:41.120> them

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
generally the same size and make them

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:51.880 
generally the same size and make them
into<00:03:42.230> big<00:03:42.709> black<00:03:43.340> circles

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:00.709 

so<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.400> these<00:03:53.730> two<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:58.879> then<00:03:59.879> put<00:04:00.180> them<00:04:00.420> onto

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 
so like these two and then put them onto

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:12.290 
so like these two and then put them onto
the<00:04:01.079> head<00:04:01.400> oops

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.550 

so<00:04:13.700> 32<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.970> BI<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.980> now<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:18.180> finish<00:04:18.390> them<00:04:18.900> I'm

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
so 32 to BI and now to finish them I'm

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.560 
so 32 to BI and now to finish them I'm
going<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.780> take<00:04:21.780> some<00:04:22.170> clay<00:04:22.620> make<00:04:23.400> one<00:04:23.670> white

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
going to take some clay make one white

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.070 
going to take some clay make one white
circle<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.700> then<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:27.120> smaller<00:04:27.960> white<00:04:28.860> oval<00:04:29.520> and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
circle and then a smaller white oval and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.410 
circle and then a smaller white oval and
for<00:04:31.080> both<00:04:31.260> eyes<00:04:31.500> I'm<00:04:31.770> going<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.340> this<00:04:32.550> put

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
for both eyes I'm going to do this put

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.770 
for both eyes I'm going to do this put
the<00:04:33.810> Oval<00:04:34.760> under<00:04:35.760> it<00:04:35.910> where<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.180> circle<00:04:36.600> is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
the Oval under it where the circle is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.260 
the Oval under it where the circle is
like<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.890> it<00:04:38.400> makes<00:04:38.610> really<00:04:38.880> nice

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
like that and it makes really nice

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:48.650 
like that and it makes really nice
looking<00:04:39.780> eyes<00:04:44.870> like<00:04:45.870> these<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:47.030> put<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.150> over

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
looking eyes like these to put this over

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:59.210 
looking eyes like these to put this over
top<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.920> Overland<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:58.010> there<00:04:59.010> are<00:04:59.130> you

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
top and the Overland and there are you

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:08.620 
top and the Overland and there are you
to<00:04:59.460> office

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.660 

yeah<00:05:09.630> I<00:05:09.990> think<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:10.830> oval<00:05:11.250> should<00:05:11.490> be<00:05:11.640> a

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
yeah I think that this oval should be a

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:28.490 
yeah I think that this oval should be a
little<00:05:11.880> smaller<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:27.030> now<00:05:27.330> for<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.050> back<00:05:28.260> of

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
little smaller and now for the back of

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.450 
little smaller and now for the back of
the<00:05:28.590> head<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:29.420> see<00:05:30.420> another<00:05:30.720> cent<00:05:31.170> fines<00:05:32.040> right
