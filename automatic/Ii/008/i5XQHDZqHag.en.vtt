 citizens change not feel 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.349
 Universiade begins with and work on

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.559
 one thousand two hundred people and take any 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.079
 ship from Kazan 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.440
 You can get to the airport in just 20 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.750
 minutes 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 will help in this aeroexpress name which 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 swallow but we are for traditional means 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
 because the movement of the car in parallel 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 You can also enjoy the beauty 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 Kazan cities should help me in this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.940
 these are the guest cards you can find them 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.090
 in all transport hubs of the city then 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.770
 let's see it now 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.220
 so open the envelope here and there 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 Kazan city map and tickets for a review 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.490
 excursions to museums and also to the Kremlin 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:23.549
 also a transport card for 5 trips to 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.560
 public transport of our city well 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.659
 That went way I think not show 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 it is necessary but it is unlikely that the games will be remembered only 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.130
 food is no exaggeration to vesemira arrival 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.710
 TV screens during the ceremony 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.719

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.100
 grandiose in the history of student games 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 the spikes of the nation which will be the lighting 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 torch remains let's smes one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.539
 little fact tickets to the ceremony 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.030
 discoveries no longer reach the general 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.829
 rehearsals of the ceremony take place now 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 they are closed to the media just known 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.569
 The music for the show was written by the composer Igor 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.799
 cool already general producer 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.840
 events the scene which will be 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.030
 the whole action is already mounted 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 it is shaped like a giant pyramid 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.099
 weighing 500 tons a 3 hour show and several 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.700
 thousand speakers this platform is exactly 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.720
 It sustains itself as spectators Arena 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.280
 detached from the brain 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.950
 I can assure you this is one of the best 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.110
 arenas of europe including security we 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.250
 did some serious work 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 analyzed the tragedies fil collection and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.910
 skier despite the fact that 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.860
 built this stadium we are in record 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.519
 no time limit for security 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.900
 influenced 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.760
 I am proud of the words of Vladimir 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.390
 Vladimir Putin who being on 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.890
 this arena 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.060
 said it was the best sport 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.560
 construction of Russia at the price and quality 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.269
 he himself handsome stadium except 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.190
 opening and closing ceremonies 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.380
 football will not be involved 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.970
 match and profile for this arena will be held 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.799
 on other objects just to 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.049
 Universiade in Kazan was specially 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.209
 built 30 new buildings and 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.400
 almost every one of them is unique in 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.560
 kind of a gymnastics center with 18 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.450
 meter-high rowing center ceilings 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.639
 the very center of the city or the palace of water 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.680
 sports that just amazes 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.329
 its design but the main budget 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 grand construction for some 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.769
 sources are almost 4 times less than in 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.930
 shenzhen chinese but the resulting 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.910
 product according to delegates significantly 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.350
 better but to all the big regret 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.079
 tend to end here 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.639
 Universiade after 11 days giving 351 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.470
 a set of medals will suit your 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.600
 completion athletes return for example 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.579
 here at the airport and we will hope 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.910
 that each of the guests of the capital coming up to 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.620
 the doors 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.180
 terminal will think what kind 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.400
 magic were the last week and a half 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.730
 and how you want to go back to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.730
 Kazan
