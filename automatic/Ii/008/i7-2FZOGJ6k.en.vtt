00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hi Nancy here and welcome back to our

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.200 
hi Nancy here and welcome back to our
thumb<00:00:03.689> gusset<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.670> we've<00:00:05.670> done<00:00:06.000> our

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
thumb gusset and we've done our

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.150 
thumb gusset and we've done our
increases<00:00:06.930> we've<00:00:07.080> gotten<00:00:07.470> all<00:00:07.680> seven

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
increases we've gotten all seven

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.430 
increases we've gotten all seven
stitches<00:00:08.429> increased<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.660> for<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> thumb

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
stitches increased and for a thumb

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.089 
stitches increased and for a thumb
gusset<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.969> knit<00:00:12.750> another<00:00:13.139> room<00:00:13.559> before<00:00:13.889> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
gusset I do knit another room before I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.640 
gusset I do knit another room before I
transfer<00:00:14.700> them<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.030> waste<00:00:15.299> yarn<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
transfer them on waste yarn and the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.349 
transfer them on waste yarn and the
reason<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
reason I do that is it's just so

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.870 
reason I do that is it's just so
difficult<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.439> capture<00:00:19.680> those<00:00:20.070> stitches<00:00:20.640> once

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
difficult to capture those stitches once

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.790 
difficult to capture those stitches once
you<00:00:21.000> put<00:00:21.210> them<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.420> waste<00:00:21.689> yarn<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.350> works<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
you put them on waste yarn it works a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.609 
you put them on waste yarn it works a
lot<00:00:22.980> better<00:00:23.150> if<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:25.019> an<00:00:25.260> extra

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
lot better if you have them an extra

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.950 
lot better if you have them an extra
stitch<00:00:26.010> knit<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.640> top<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.180> them<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.720> works

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
stitch knit on top of them it just works

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.169 
stitch knit on top of them it just works
easier<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> we're

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
easier so we're going to do that we're

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.479 
easier so we're going to do that we're
going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> work<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.779> more<00:00:31.050> around<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.219> that

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
going to work one more around so that

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.030 
going to work one more around so that
you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.410> onto<00:00:34.829> waste

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
you can see how we get these onto waste

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:44.240 
you can see how we get these onto waste
yarn<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.910> difficult<00:00:36.739> okay<00:00:42.649> we're<00:00:43.649> wrong
