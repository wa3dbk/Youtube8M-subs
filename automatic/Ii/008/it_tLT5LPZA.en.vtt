00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so i would i would hope to have him you

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130 
so i would i would hope to have him you
know<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> top<00:01:35.850> 10<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.750> sure<00:01:36.900> after

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
know in the top 10 for sure after

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.440 
know in the top 10 for sure after
dressage<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.770> he<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.820> quite<00:01:38.909> lazy<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.420> i

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
dressage and he can be quite lazy so i

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
dressage and he can be quite lazy so i
think<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.720> big<00:01:39.930> arena<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.409> will<00:01:40.650> suit<00:01:40.890> him

and wake him up a little bit you felt

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
and wake him up a little bit you felt
pretty<00:01:42.390> spicy<00:01:42.630> today<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:43.439> good<00:01:43.619> that's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
pretty spicy today so that's good that's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
pretty spicy today so that's good that's
good<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.189> him<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.520> mean<00:01:45.090> he's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> super<00:01:45.600> jumper

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
good for him I mean he's a super jumper

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.719 
good for him I mean he's a super jumper
he<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.829> often<00:01:47.130> jumps<00:01:47.369> clear<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
he very often jumps clear in the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.100 
he very often jumps clear in the
showjumping<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.360> normally<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
showjumping it's normally if I make a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
showjumping it's normally if I make a
mistake<00:01:49.170> he<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> real<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.729> our

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
mistake he is real so I think our

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.950 
mistake he is real so I think our
biggest<00:01:50.970> challenge<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> cross

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
