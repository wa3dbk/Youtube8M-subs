is<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.780> very<00:02:59.200> diverse<00:02:59.530> player<00:03:00.130> base<00:03:00.370> when<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
is a very diverse player base when it

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.850 
is a very diverse player base when it
comes<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.090> battlefield<00:03:01.630> with<00:03:02.230> battlefield<00:03:02.530> 3

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
comes to battlefield with battlefield 3

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.770 
comes to battlefield with battlefield 3
they<00:03:03.040> attracted<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.610> lot<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.940> infantry<00:03:04.510> players

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
they attracted a lot of infantry players

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.770 
they attracted a lot of infantry players
as<00:03:05.080> well<00:03:05.470> as<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:06.010> lot<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.459> vehicle<00:03:07.090> orientated

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
as well as a lot of vehicle orientated

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.720 
as well as a lot of vehicle orientated
and<00:03:07.900> veteran<00:03:08.500> players<00:03:08.830> being<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.310> there<00:03:09.550> as

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
and veteran players being in there as

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.520 
and veteran players being in there as
well<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.570> think<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> would<00:03:10.989> make<00:03:11.200> sense<00:03:11.230> to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
well so I think it would make sense to

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.890 
well so I think it would make sense to
try<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:11.950> pick<00:03:12.100> maps<00:03:12.400> from<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.239> variety<00:03:13.630> of

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
try and pick maps from a variety of

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.220 
try and pick maps from a variety of
games<00:03:14.820> but<00:03:15.820> there<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.360> much<00:03:16.540> up<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.080> air

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
games but there is so much up in the air

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.350 
games but there is so much up in the air
at<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.739> moment<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.250> can't<00:03:18.549> actually<00:03:18.790> be

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
at the moment that we can't actually be

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.630 
at the moment that we can't actually be
sure<00:03:19.630> what<00:03:20.350> they're<00:03:20.620> going<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.980> be<00:03:21.100> announcing

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
sure what they're going to be announcing

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.850 
sure what they're going to be announcing
but<00:03:21.790> one<00:03:21.940> thing<00:03:22.150> we<00:03:22.269> do<00:03:22.510> know<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.410> by<00:03:23.830> the

but one thing we do know is that by the
