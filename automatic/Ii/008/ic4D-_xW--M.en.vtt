00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
types that's Chicago typewriter it's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.420 
types that's Chicago typewriter it's
pretty<00:00:19.980> cool<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.670> got<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.960> 10-4<00:00:22.500> firepower<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
pretty cool it's got a 10-4 firepower a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.939 
pretty cool it's got a 10-4 firepower a
point<00:00:23.789> 10<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.240> firing<00:00:24.449> speed<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.289> looks

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
point 10 for firing speed and it looks

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.140 
point 10 for firing speed and it looks
like<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> 283<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.869> reload<00:00:28.439> speed<00:00:28.740> its<00:00:29.460> capacity

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
like a 283 for reload speed its capacity

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.290 
like a 283 for reload speed its capacity
as<00:00:30.240> infinite<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.019> pretty<00:00:31.199> cool<00:00:32.300> we

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
as infinite so that's pretty cool we

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.069 
as infinite so that's pretty cool we
have<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> prl<00:00:35.300> doesn't<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.420> any<00:00:36.570> stats<00:00:36.870> but

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
have the prl doesn't have any stats but

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.420 
have the prl doesn't have any stats but
it's<00:00:37.230> pretty<00:00:37.410> cool<00:00:37.559> kills<00:00:37.920> everything<00:00:38.190> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it's pretty cool kills everything in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
it's pretty cool kills everything in
like<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.760> hit<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.510> your<00:00:42.930> rocket

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
like one hit we have your rocket

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
like one hit we have your rocket
launcher<00:00:43.680> infinite<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.520> pretty<00:00:44.969> cool

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
launcher infinite it's pretty cool

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.160 
launcher infinite it's pretty cool
infinite<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> key<00:00:46.680> word<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:47.899> this<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
infinite is the key word there this is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
infinite is the key word there this is
the<00:00:49.320> Matilda<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.190> didn't<00:00:50.730> upgrade

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the Matilda which I didn't upgrade

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
the Matilda which I didn't upgrade
because<00:00:51.329> personally<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
because personally I do not like the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
because personally I do not like the
Matilda<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.329> upgrade<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.309> its

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
Matilda so I did not upgrade it but its

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.150 
Matilda so I did not upgrade it but its
exclusive<00:00:56.910> increases<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> ammo<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> 100

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
exclusive increases the ammo up to 100

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
exclusive increases the ammo up to 100
so<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.180> cool<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.660> fire<00:01:00.840> powers

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
so that's pretty cool it's fire powers

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.090 
so that's pretty cool it's fire powers
gets<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.399> 2.5<00:01:03.589> reloads<00:01:04.589> mean<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.920> don't

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
gets to be like 2.5 reloads mean I don't

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.840 
gets to be like 2.5 reloads mean I don't
know<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.460> pay<00:01:05.580> attention<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:07.850> hand

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
know I don't pay attention to that hand

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
know I don't pay attention to that hand
cannon<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> lot<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> people<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> when

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
cannon a lot of people think that when

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.850 
cannon a lot of people think that when
you<00:01:10.590> buy<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.909> fully<00:01:12.840> upgraded<00:01:13.650> but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you buy it it's it's fully upgraded but

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.760 
you buy it it's it's fully upgraded but
it's<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.500> about<00:01:16.500> 800

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it's not you need to like have about 800

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's not you need to like have about 800
thousand<00:01:17.430> pesetas<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.549> its<00:01:20.549> firepower<00:01:20.759> is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thousand pesetas or so its firepower is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.490 
thousand pesetas or so its firepower is
99.9<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> pretty<00:01:23.340> freaking<00:01:23.820> sweet

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
99.9 which is pretty freaking sweet

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.789 
99.9 which is pretty freaking sweet
firing<00:01:25.500> speed<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.880> point<00:01:27.299> 17<00:01:28.049> reload

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
firing speed is one point 17 reload

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.300 
firing speed is one point 17 reload
speed<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.759> point<00:01:30.450> 83<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.530> its<00:01:32.130> capacity

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
speed is one point 83 and its capacity

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.840 
speed is one point 83 and its capacity
is<00:01:32.790> infinite<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> upgrade<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.850> i'm

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
is infinite when you upgrade it i'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880 
is infinite when you upgrade it i'm
going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> show<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.930> fire

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
the rocket launcher that's pretty baby

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.050 
the rocket launcher that's pretty baby
safe<00:02:15.810> home<00:02:16.610> close<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:18.030> yeah<00:02:19.549> but<00:02:20.549> tilde<00:02:20.880> has

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
safe home close to be yeah but tilde has

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.630 
safe home close to be yeah but tilde has
a<00:02:21.090> burst<00:02:21.390> fire<00:02:21.660> capability<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.799> when<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.370> fire

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
a burst fire capability so when you fire

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
a burst fire capability so when you fire
it<00:02:23.670> goes<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:27.019> what<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.049> don't<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.470> do

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
it goes like that what I don't we do

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.630 
it goes like that what I don't we do
when<00:02:28.799> i<00:02:28.860> use<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.340> i<00:02:29.519> just<00:02:29.580> tap<00:02:31.280> 7-up<00:02:32.280> conserve

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
when i use it i just tap 7-up conserve

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
when i use it i just tap 7-up conserve
ammo<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.269> on<00:02:33.390> empty<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:33.870> i<00:02:34.200> guess<00:02:34.470> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
ammo but on empty now so i guess that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.080 
ammo but on empty now so i guess that
