originally had this way back in the day
what<00:00:39.910> changed<00:00:40.420> between<00:00:40.480> there<00:00:41.080> and<00:00:41.350> now

bringing<00:00:41.980> out<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.250> full<00:00:42.519> electric<00:00:42.729> again<00:00:43.150> well

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
bringing out a full electric again well

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.090 
bringing out a full electric again well
I<00:00:43.600> think<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.900> lot<00:00:44.050> has<00:00:44.290> changed<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:45.070> think

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
I think a lot has changed I think

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.880 
I think a lot has changed I think
customers<00:00:45.699> are<00:00:46.300> a<00:00:46.330> lot<00:00:46.540> more<00:00:46.870> aware<00:00:47.229> now<00:00:47.260> of

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
customers are a lot more aware now of

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.140 
customers are a lot more aware now of
electric<00:00:48.280> vehicles<00:00:48.699> there's<00:00:49.000> kind<00:00:49.120> of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
electric vehicles there's kind of

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.329 
electric vehicles there's kind of
removable<00:00:49.540> going<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.900> right<00:00:50.140> now<00:00:50.170> for<00:00:50.530> EVs<00:00:51.010> in

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
removable going on right now for EVs in

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.430 
removable going on right now for EVs in
the<00:00:51.400> marketplace<00:00:51.850> I<00:00:52.120> also<00:00:52.420> think<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:53.019> timing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
the marketplace I also think the timing

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.410 
the marketplace I also think the timing
was<00:00:53.470> right<00:00:53.710> as<00:00:54.129> far<00:00:54.280> as<00:00:54.339> battery<00:00:54.549> technology

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
was right as far as battery technology

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.360 
was right as far as battery technology
this<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.780> powered<00:00:56.110> by<00:00:56.140> lithium<00:00:56.530> ion<00:00:56.949> batteries

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
this is powered by lithium ion batteries

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.830 
this is powered by lithium ion batteries
the<00:00:57.820> time<00:00:58.089> for<00:00:58.390> electric<00:00:58.690> vehicles<00:00:59.049> is<00:00:59.170> right

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.200 

this<00:01:03.470> is<00:01:03.740> the<00:01:04.070> collaboration<00:01:04.760> with<00:01:04.879> Tesla

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
this is the collaboration with Tesla

okay first Akio Toyoda and Elon Musk got

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.270 
okay first Akio Toyoda and Elon Musk got
together<00:01:09.050> from<00:01:09.470> what<00:01:09.650> I<00:01:09.680> hear<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:09.980> was<00:01:10.010> over

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
together from what I hear it was over

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.820 
together from what I hear it was over
some<00:01:10.430> drinks<00:01:10.550> I'm<00:01:11.030> sure<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.800> decided<00:01:12.800> that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830

brought a lot of things that I think

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.700 
brought a lot of things that I think

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
that was a wheelspin yeah that's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.030 
that was a wheelspin yeah that's

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
a world of difference right there game

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.390 
a world of difference right there game
on<00:02:20.180> off<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.360> line<00:02:20.690> now<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.230> see<00:02:21.380> my<00:02:21.500> range<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:22.220> was

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
on off the line now I see my range I was

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.740 
on off the line now I see my range I was
down<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> little<00:02:22.850> bit<00:02:22.940> more<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.150> sport<00:02:23.420> boat<00:02:23.600> as

down a little bit more in sport boat as
well<00:02:23.930> man<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.380> lost<00:02:24.530> about<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.860> mile<00:02:25.160> yeah<00:02:25.820> it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
well man we lost about a mile yeah it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.430 
well man we lost about a mile yeah it
worth<00:02:26.690> it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
worth it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.550 
worth it
Boston<00:02:28.190> boxes<00:02:28.550> I've<00:02:28.670> burnt<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.060> much<00:02:29.270> rubber

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.470 

to<00:02:35.560> show<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.710> guys<00:02:35.860> unveiled<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.460> 2013<00:02:37.060> rav4

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
to show you guys unveiled to 2013 rav4

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.570 
to show you guys unveiled to 2013 rav4
which<00:02:38.200> actually<00:02:38.650> looks<00:02:38.860> different<00:02:39.280> from<00:02:39.460> this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
which actually looks different from this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.640 
which actually looks different from this
but<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.240> is<00:02:40.420> new<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.260> what<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
but this one is new so what was the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.320 
but this one is new so what was the
thought<00:02:41.830> there<00:02:42.100> yeah<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.850> brought<00:02:43.090> this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
thought there yeah we brought this

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.830 
thought there yeah we brought this
vehicle<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.350> from<00:02:44.650> concept<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.490> production<00:02:46.300> in

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
vehicle to from concept to production in

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.230 
vehicle to from concept to production in
22<00:02:47.320> months<00:02:47.680> working<00:02:48.310> with<00:02:48.490> Tesla<00:02:48.940> Motors

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
22 months working with Tesla Motors

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.210 
22 months working with Tesla Motors
schedule<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.050> quick<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:50.860> went<00:02:51.010> ahead<00:02:51.070> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
schedule is so quick we went ahead and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.820 
schedule is so quick we went ahead and
went<00:02:51.460> with<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> older<00:02:52.030> body<00:02:52.210> style<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.870> also

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
went with the older body style and also

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.660 
went with the older body style and also
it<00:02:53.950> provides<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.340> little<00:02:54.460> bit<00:02:54.580> of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it provides a little bit of

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.640 
it provides a little bit of
differentiation<00:02:55.360> between<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.290> all-electric

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
differentiation between the all-electric

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.280 
differentiation between the all-electric
and<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> regular<00:02:57.760> rav4<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.930> future<00:02:59.200> we

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and the regular rav4 in the future we

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.540 
and the regular rav4 in the future we
might<00:02:59.470> move<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.830> new<00:02:59.920> body<00:03:00.130> style<00:03:00.190> but

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
might move to the new body style but

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.230 
might move to the new body style but
right<00:03:00.700> now<00:03:00.820> we're<00:03:01.000> sticking<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> 2012

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.520 

what<00:03:07.240> did<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.420> guys<00:03:07.510> do<00:03:07.660> about<00:03:07.870> regen<00:03:08.320> because

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
what did you guys do about regen because

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.140 
what did you guys do about regen because
it<00:03:08.620> doesn't<00:03:08.860> really<00:03:08.980> feel<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.370> that's<00:03:09.760> going

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
it doesn't really feel like that's going

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.750 
it doesn't really feel like that's going
on<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.750> very<00:03:10.990> slight<00:03:11.410> or<00:03:11.740> is<00:03:12.040> even<00:03:12.459> here

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
on is it very slight or is even here

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.390 
on is it very slight or is even here
it's<00:03:13.000> very<00:03:13.420> similar<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.959> our<00:03:14.140> Prius<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.920> you

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
it's very similar to our Prius if you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.140 
it's very similar to our Prius if you
put<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.090> mode<00:03:16.330> two<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.020> that<00:03:17.230> a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
put it in the mode two you can do that a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.500 
put it in the mode two you can do that a
lot<00:03:19.150> yeah<00:03:19.630> 93<00:03:20.500> miles<00:03:21.250> what<00:03:21.640> my<00:03:21.730> range<00:03:21.940> says<00:03:22.239> now

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
lot yeah 93 miles what my range says now

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.050 
lot yeah 93 miles what my range says now
and<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.140> what<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.440> said<00:03:23.709> when<00:03:24.010> we<00:03:24.190> changed

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
and that's what it said when we changed

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.970 
and that's what it said when we changed
the<00:03:25.270> air<00:03:25.390> conditioning<00:03:25.959> yeah<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.620> climate

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
the air conditioning yeah the climate

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.890 
the air conditioning yeah the climate
control<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.640> your<00:03:27.850> biggest<00:03:28.270> draw<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
control is your biggest draw on the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.570 
control is your biggest draw on the
battery<00:03:29.320> outside<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.800> just<00:03:29.890> operating<00:03:30.489> the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
battery outside of just operating the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.090 
battery outside of just operating the
vehicle<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.570> we<00:03:31.690> have<00:03:31.900> these<00:03:32.110> auto<00:03:32.470> climate

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
vehicle so we have these auto climate

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.850 
vehicle so we have these auto climate
eco<00:03:33.670> modes<00:03:33.940> preset<00:03:34.840> right<00:03:35.350> now<00:03:35.500> we've<00:03:35.680> got<00:03:35.830> it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
eco modes preset right now we've got it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.860 
eco modes preset right now we've got it
in<00:03:36.100> Eco<00:03:36.430> high<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:37.300> it's<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.660> most

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
in Eco high so it's the most

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.650 
in Eco high so it's the most
conservative<00:03:38.459> auto<00:03:39.459> climate<00:03:39.850> setting<00:03:40.420> and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
conservative auto climate setting and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.289 
conservative auto climate setting and
maximizes<00:03:41.500> range<00:03:41.769> we<00:03:42.160> also<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.640> eco<00:03:43.030> low

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
maximizes range we also have eco low

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.789 
maximizes range we also have eco low
we're<00:03:43.930> gonna<00:03:44.080> give<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.410> little<00:03:44.560> more

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
we're gonna give you a little more

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.160 
we're gonna give you a little more
climate<00:03:45.250> comfort<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.910> then<00:03:46.450> we<00:03:46.540> have<00:03:46.720> normal

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
climate comfort and then we have normal

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.560 
climate comfort and then we have normal
that<00:03:47.320> will<00:03:47.440> operate<00:03:47.739> like<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.280> typical<00:03:48.610> climate

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
that will operate like a typical climate

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.270 
that will operate like a typical climate
would<00:03:49.780> but<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.620> going<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.799> give<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
would but it's going to give you the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240 
would but it's going to give you the
least<00:03:51.459> amount<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.880> range<00:03:52.980> where<00:03:53.980> do<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.130> guys

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
least amount of range where do you guys

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.800 
least amount of range where do you guys
see<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.580> collaboration<00:03:55.330> between<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.660> and

see this collaboration between you and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.449 
see this collaboration between you and
Tesla<00:03:56.080> goings<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> big<00:03:56.980> deal<00:03:57.160> in<00:03:57.370> the
