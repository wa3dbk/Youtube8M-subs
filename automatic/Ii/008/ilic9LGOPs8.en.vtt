it's<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.340> chicago<00:00:35.340> auto<00:00:35.460> show<00:00:35.610> videos

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it's one of my chicago auto show videos

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
it's one of my chicago auto show videos
it<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> pretty<00:00:38.219> far<00:00:38.550> down<00:00:38.760> into<00:00:40.520> into<00:00:41.520> my

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it is a pretty far down into into my

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.900 
it is a pretty far down into into my
videos<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> my<00:00:43.250> older<00:00:44.250> videos<00:00:44.280> but

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
videos it's one of my older videos but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.630 
videos it's one of my older videos but
it's<00:00:44.969> down<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.870> check<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:47.100> you

haven't seen it but i do have this car
hopefully<00:00:50.730> i'll<00:00:50.850> pick<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.180> some<00:00:51.390> more<00:00:51.600> because

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
hopefully i'll pick up some more because

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.779 
hopefully i'll pick up some more because
it's<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.829> nice<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> video<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it's really nice to have a video on the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's really nice to have a video on the
car<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> i<00:00:54.949> also<00:00:55.949> picked<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.579> car<00:00:56.879> here

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
car to it i also picked up this car here

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
car to it i also picked up this car here
i<00:00:57.890> have<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> white<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> thought<00:01:00.090> hey

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
i have the white one so I thought hey

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
i have the white one so I thought hey
you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> had<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.320> museum<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you know what I had that museum well and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.850 
you know what I had that museum well and
I<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> other<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.470> also<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> picked

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I just get this other one also I picked

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.859 
I just get this other one also I picked
up<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.159> third<00:01:06.740> third<00:01:07.740> Pierce<00:01:08.100> dash<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:09.270> mean

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
up a third third Pierce dash I mean

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.520 
up a third third Pierce dash I mean
Pierce<00:01:10.110> velocity<00:01:11.900> aerial<00:01:12.900> tower<00:01:13.140> truck

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
Pierce velocity aerial tower truck

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.609 
Pierce velocity aerial tower truck
because<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.750> really<00:01:15.750> need<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.140> start<00:01:16.350> adding

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
because I really need to start adding

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.340 
because I really need to start adding
more<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.280> aerial<00:01:17.759> trucks<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
more of these aerial trucks them as you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
more of these aerial trucks them as you
know<00:01:19.470> station<00:01:20.100> 2<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> running<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> no<00:01:21.210> for

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
know station 2 is running with a no for

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
know station 2 is running with a no for
Pierce<00:01:21.780> quantum<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Pierce quantum so I'm going to put this

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
Pierce quantum so I'm going to put this
truck<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> temporary<00:01:25.140> truck<00:01:25.740> i'm<00:01:25.979> going

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
truck in as a temporary truck i'm going

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
truck in as a temporary truck i'm going
to<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.250> both<00:01:26.430> aerials<00:01:27.000> running<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to have both aerials running out of that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.490 
to have both aerials running out of that
station<00:01:28.020> plus<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> two<00:01:29.299> other<00:01:30.350> aerials<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
station plus the two other aerials that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.999 
station plus the two other aerials that
they<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.979> currently<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> does<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.530> unit

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
they have currently so does this unit

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
they have currently so does this unit
will<00:01:35.130> rotate<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
will rotate with the other with the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.380 
will rotate with the other with the
quantum<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.869> while<00:01:39.869> they're<00:01:40.140> being<00:01:40.470> rotated

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
quantum and while they're being rotated

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
quantum and while they're being rotated
we're<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> wait<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.680> end

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
we're going to wait to see if we do end

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
we're going to wait to see if we do end
up<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.280> more<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.040> matchbox<00:01:47.549> does<00:01:47.790> this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
up with more if the matchbox does this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.410 
up with more if the matchbox does this
truck<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.229> red<00:01:49.909> I'll<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.000> pretty<00:01:51.180> nice

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
truck with all red I'll be pretty nice

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
truck with all red I'll be pretty nice
if<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.140> had<00:01:52.350> an<00:01:52.470> Allred<00:01:52.890> cab<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.490> Whyte

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
if it was had an Allred cab with Whyte

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
if it was had an Allred cab with Whyte
running<00:01:54.270> through<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.049> because

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
running through it like that because

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.649 
running through it like that because
then<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.040> put<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.579> station<00:01:57.060> too<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.509> for

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
then I can put it in station too but for

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.139 
then I can put it in station too but for
now<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.229> how<00:01:58.350> i<00:01:58.409> said<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.610> truck<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> going

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
now like how i said this truck is going

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
now like how i said this truck is going
to<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> temporary

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
to be a it's going to be a temporary

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.539 
to be a it's going to be a temporary
truck<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:04.399> rotating<00:02:05.399> with

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
truck and it's going to be rotating with

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.570 
truck and it's going to be rotating with
aerial<00:02:06.000> 1<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.570> 0<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.960> quantum<00:02:07.759> every<00:02:08.759> call<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
aerial 1 the 0 for quantum every call so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.610 
aerial 1 the 0 for quantum every call so
the<00:02:11.580> station<00:02:12.420> will<00:02:12.599> have<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.050> truck

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the station will have this truck

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890 
the station will have this truck
as<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.159> temporary<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.209> other<00:02:15.360> ones<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.720> for

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
as a temporary the other ones up for
