know the last 10 times the reward was

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
know the last 10 times the reward was
over<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> dog<00:00:53.699> moves<00:00:54.000> itself<00:00:54.510> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
over there so the dog moves itself just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
over there so the dog moves itself just
a<00:00:54.899> tiny<00:00:55.170> bit<00:00:55.469> closer<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.520> where<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> thinks<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
a tiny bit closer to where it thinks the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.779 
a tiny bit closer to where it thinks the
rewards<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> come<00:00:58.579> sixteenth<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.670> an

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
rewards going to come sixteenth of an

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
rewards going to come sixteenth of an
inch<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.930> tiny<00:01:01.050> bit<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.920> course<00:01:02.129> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
inch a little tiny bit and of course I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
inch a little tiny bit and of course I
don't<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:02.730> notice<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.840> keep<00:01:03.930> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
don't even notice it I just keep going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
don't even notice it I just keep going
your<00:01:04.409> dog<00:01:04.530> lowers<00:01:04.860> its<00:01:05.010> head<00:01:05.129> 1/16<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:05.820> inch

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
your dog lowers its head 1/16 of an inch

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.840 
your dog lowers its head 1/16 of an inch
or<00:01:06.119> moves<00:01:06.330> 1/16<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.200> inch<00:01:07.260> closer<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.680> you

or moves 1/16 of an inch closer to you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.500 
or moves 1/16 of an inch closer to you
you<00:01:08.850> don't<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you don't see that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080 
you don't see that
so<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> reward<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.640> next<00:01:12.000> time

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
so you reward it and then the next time

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.460 
so you reward it and then the next time
it's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.570> closer<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> over<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it's a little bit closer and over the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
it's a little bit closer and over the
next<00:01:13.590> hundred<00:01:13.799> repetitions<00:01:14.130> suddenly<00:01:14.880> your

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
next hundred repetitions suddenly your

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.640 
next hundred repetitions suddenly your
dog's<00:01:15.119> heads<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.810> he's<00:01:16.020> healing<00:01:16.200> crooked

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
dog's heads here he's healing crooked

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
dog's heads here he's healing crooked
across<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.100> body<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.720> know

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
across your body so because we know

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.390 
across your body so because we know
we're<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.560> perfect<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.250> our

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
we're not going to be perfect in our

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.359 
we're not going to be perfect in our
criteria<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.810> reward<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> dog<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.070> that

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
criteria we reward the dog in a way that

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.420 
criteria we reward the dog in a way that
reinforces<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.180> behavior<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.890> when

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
reinforces the behavior we want so when

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
reinforces the behavior we want so when
I<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.850> healing<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.330> produced<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> rewards

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I when healing I produced the rewards

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
I when healing I produced the rewards
over<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.740> above<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> dog's<00:01:29.759> head<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.150> my

over here above the dog's head on my
left<00:01:30.509> side<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.520> flax<00:01:32.820> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
left side so now if I'm a little flax in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
left side so now if I'm a little flax in
my<00:01:33.060> criteria<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> rewards<00:01:34.770> being

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
my criteria where the rewards being

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
my criteria where the rewards being
produced<00:01:35.189> makes<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> dog<00:01:35.790> move<00:01:36.030> himself<00:01:36.210> back

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
produced makes the dog move himself back

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.969 
produced makes the dog move himself back
here<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.680> thinks<00:01:37.860> it's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
here and look up more he thinks it's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
here and look up more he thinks it's
going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.270> keeps<00:01:39.540> himself

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
going to be up there so he keeps himself

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.359 
going to be up there so he keeps himself
in<00:01:40.079> position<00:01:40.320> better<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
in position better and I don't have to
