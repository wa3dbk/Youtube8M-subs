causes obesity or obesity which then

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.170 
causes obesity or obesity which then
produces<00:01:52.500> inflammation<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.640> secondary

effect<00:01:54.540> I've<00:01:54.930> always<00:01:55.320> believed<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.800> we

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
effect I've always believed that we

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
effect I've always believed that we
become<00:01:56.250> inflamed<00:01:56.640> first<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.390> gain<00:01:57.840> weight

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
become inflamed first and gain weight

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
become inflamed first and gain weight
second<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:59.040> makes<00:01:59.310> us<00:01:59.430> even<00:01:59.550> more<00:01:59.670> inflamed

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
second which makes us even more inflamed

this is what I found in patient after
patients<00:06:35.159> what<00:06:35.310> I<00:06:35.340> described<00:06:35.789> in<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.750> book

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
patients what I described in the book

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.159 
patients what I described in the book
ultra<00:06:37.860> metabolism<00:06:38.520> and<00:06:38.639> it's<00:06:39.539> a<00:06:39.720> powerful

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
ultra metabolism and it's a powerful

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.469 
ultra metabolism and it's a powerful

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
obesity and chronic disease we have to

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.370 
obesity and chronic disease we have to
look<00:06:44.669> at<00:06:44.820> the<00:06:44.940> source<00:06:45.210> of<00:06:45.300> the<00:06:45.389> problem<00:06:45.840> so

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
look at the source of the problem so

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.839 
look at the source of the problem so
let's<00:06:46.590> review<00:06:46.770> what<00:06:47.039> we<00:06:47.159> learned<00:06:47.190> when<00:06:47.820> you

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
let's review what we learned when you

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.879 
let's review what we learned when you
eat<00:06:48.090> a<00:06:48.120> typical<00:06:48.659> American<00:06:49.080> diet<00:06:49.110> you

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
eat a typical American diet you

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.339 
eat a typical American diet you
foster<00:06:50.310> the<00:06:50.430> growth<00:06:50.460> of<00:06:50.939> bad<00:06:51.270> bugs<00:06:51.629> in<00:06:51.810> the<00:06:51.900> gut

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
foster the growth of bad bugs in the gut

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.129 
foster the growth of bad bugs in the gut
they<00:06:53.280> then<00:06:53.610> damage<00:06:54.180> the<00:06:54.360> gut<00:06:54.509> lining<00:06:54.810> and

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
they then damage the gut lining and

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.929 
they then damage the gut lining and
produce<00:06:55.409> toxins<00:06:56.039> that<00:06:56.280> are<00:06:56.340> absorbed<00:06:56.789> into

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
produce toxins that are absorbed into

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.939 
produce toxins that are absorbed into
your<00:06:57.060> system<00:06:57.419> because<00:06:58.169> of<00:06:58.289> them<00:06:58.409> the<00:06:58.560> damage

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
your system because of them the damage

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.950 
your system because of them the damage
is<00:06:59.069> there<00:06:59.279> partially<00:07:00.120> digested<00:07:00.330> food<00:07:00.689> a

is there partially digested food a
particles<00:07:01.409> also<00:07:01.620> leaked<00:07:02.279> into<00:07:02.490> your

particles also leaked into your

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.489 
particles also leaked into your
bloodstream<00:07:02.789> then<00:07:03.719> your<00:07:03.900> immune<00:07:04.139> system

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:04.499

reacts<00:07:04.800> to<00:07:04.889> the<00:07:04.979> toxins<00:07:05.490> in<00:07:05.639> the<00:07:05.789> foods

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
reacts to the toxins in the foods

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.469 
reacts to the toxins in the foods
producing<00:07:06.689> a<00:07:06.749> firestorm<00:07:07.620> of<00:07:07.740> inflammation
