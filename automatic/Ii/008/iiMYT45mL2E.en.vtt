00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.459
 twice the RSV Stahnsdorf had her the white jerseys in attack Henze Song 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.890
 Preparatory matches against Hannover could win on Sunday 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.069
 third victory 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.569
 and it went down well for the RSV 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.799
 even if it always the Hannoveraner Townsend the long balls 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:16.570
 pilfer 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.519
 HSV was able to sell first 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.939
 but mistakes are increasingly sneaking out of the way and that's how it turns out 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.329
 20 to 13 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.449
 at 25 to 27 residue 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.089
 but despite a briefing Hanover manages the lead on even ten 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.390
 Expand points 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.960
 the shortly before half time then the catch-up crowning conclusion of this 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 thanks to the 44 to 45 halftime score 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.290
 but after the break, the challenging first succeeds Balda 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.360
 a threesome for 47 to 46 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.070
 And then even Center Jobs sunk and was still a threesome 50 to 46 leads 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.670
 the RSV at once 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880
 From now on, the game weighed back and forth 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.740
 both teams are fighting for each basket 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.940
 HSV is playing much better now than in the first half 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 but the lead never grows to more than three to four points for as well 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.020
 Hannover shows what it can do 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.870
 and so a dramatic game develops 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.930
 The guests have several times luck and sunk with the expiration of the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 24-second clock some threesome 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.150
 the HSV shows its playful qualities and so it remains to the joy 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 the audience exciting 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.319
 four points clear two and a half minutes before the end of the third quarter 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.920
 jan-peter Prasuhn of Hannover keeps score in the game 18 points succeed him 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.410
 in the second half 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.040
 Again and again, the RSV pitch in the final but then succeeds Sebastian 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.090
 Schmohl with a great threesome to increase to 74 to 68 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.120
 who thought that was the decision was mistaken for too many playback errors 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.260
 yes that was well suited to give something clean 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.920
 the newcomer from Hannover fought doggedly 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 and thus approached 75 to 73 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.870
 The game was on the knife edge but just now wanted the ball 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.340
 just do not fall into the opponent's basket 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.470
 it was desperate 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 but two and a half minutes before the end of the preliminary decision 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.999
 fast pass forwards on Christoph Weise 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.259
 he does not hesitate and pulls off 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.609
 three points so 78 to 73 leadership for the RSV Stahnsdorf 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.219
 The guests are now running out of time and need to quickly graduate 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.269
 but that gives opportunity for counterattack 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.319
 which the RSV uses clawed 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.730
 And so the Exko is nine seconds from time 86 to 81 for the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.929
 challenger 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.950
 last attack and that is reserved for Riederich Lennartz 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.459
 with a crash thanks 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.459
 to provide for the 88 to 81 final score 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.519
 successful home premiere so for the RSV
