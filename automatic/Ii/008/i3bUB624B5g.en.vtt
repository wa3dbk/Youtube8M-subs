00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.840
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to make some 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.900
 delicious truffles with coverage 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.480
 dark chocolate white chocolate and 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.369
 nuts for this we are going to use the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.420
 following ingredients we are going to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.599
 need 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.970
 half a liter cream 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.650
 We are going to use chocolate coverage 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:36.320
 white half kilo chocolate coating 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:41.079
 dark bitter 250 grams coverage 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.989
 milk chocolate half kilo nuts 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.180
 toasted and chopped and pirouettes for 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.899
 place the truffles to our truffles 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.829
 let's start putting in a pot to 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.690
 fire low calculating well be medium 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.010
 liter 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 whipping cream let's heat 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.170
 until a few seconds before it boils 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.119
 we must be vigilant we should not 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.759
 stop boiling the milk cream 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:17.990
 to then incorporate it to half a kilo of 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:20.990
 chocolate in this case this milk that 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.299
 we have this match in small pieces and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.490
 let's melt it to form the part 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.570
 of the desire that is going to be the interior of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.220
 the chocolate truffles then just to 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.550
 this point before it starts to boil 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 we turn off the burner and let's walk it 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.490
 to melt the chocolate 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.990
 then so hot let's empty the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.440
 half a liter of milk cream milk 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.830
 our chocolate this way and let's 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.050
 to move to avoid lumps and that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.080
 did 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:02.350
 once we have it like that we are going to go 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:05.860
 moving gently to go forming what 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.410
 that is going to be the win once you're 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.160
 everything well integrated we will take to the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.440
 refrigerator and let's stop a day 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.840
 for another to be well but very cold 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.910
 we are moving until it dissolves 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.490
 completely 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.020
 then look here you have already 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.960
 melted all the chocolate and we're going to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.470
 wait for it to cool for then cold 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.230
 put in the refrigerator and as I repeat 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.240
 expect from one day to the next that our 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.340
 balance is well set 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.020
 then once it has already passed and has 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.170
 been in the refrigerator for a day to 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.000
 another let's do the following we're going to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.780
 take in this case two teaspoons 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.260
 small and we are going to take approximately 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 this size to manipulate it least 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 possible 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.930
 there it is we are going to take it there and we are going to 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 gently form small balls to see there 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.400
 so they can appreciate smooth 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.030
 gently and we leave them here I'm 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.780
 putting here in a this plastic with 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.630
 a pinch of butter or oil that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.500
 can apply spray so you do not 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.170
 hit and immediately we do all 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.660
 we take the balls quickly to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.760
 refrigerator so they come back to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.480
 cool down because it's very but very 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.390
 delicate then in this way we are going to 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.270
 prepare 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:49.020
 all the balls of our truffles 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.910
 then once you have already been a 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.280
 good time in the refrigerator we go to 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.790
 do the following we are going to remove them 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.190
 so very gently remember that they are very 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.180
 very delicate and in this case I'm going to 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.620
 go through this nuts that are finely 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.190
 chopped 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:14.720
 there we are going to form a small circle there 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:19.370
 and then we're going to put some here 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.880
 in these pirotines also another option 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.870
 that we have is equal to withdraw and the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.870
 in this case we went through chocolates that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.890
 we have scratched chocolate bitter cover 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.350
 Grated there is equal 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.590
 so we take them very gently and the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.590
 we are placing in the pilotines 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.490
 another option that we have is to take the 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.770
 truffle equal first we went through 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.570
 nuts there is of you so trying 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.820
 of not touching it a lot because it's super 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.700
 super soft delicate 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.630
 once it's like this we pass it by 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.230
 melted chocolate coating 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:13.220
 quickly there we remove the surplus and 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:19.220
 come back to the nut again so that 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:22.850
 that form creates a hard layer and for 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.960
 inside it's going to be super super soft 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:30.680
 there we are again not as a 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.440
 ball may only be passed by 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.520
 It is not hate and also if you wish it could 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.360
 be passed by a pinch of chocolate 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:46.180
 grated there is going to be hard and 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:49.180
 then we put it there in the piro team 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.150
 then there are several options we are going to 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.850
 repeat again 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.740
 now let's pass it backwards we're going to 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.350
 go first for chocolate 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.670
 grated in this way 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.770
 there is 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.840
 once we've gone through the 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:11.440
 grated chocolate we are going to 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:15.560
 pass it through the coverage in this case 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:19.280
 which is white coverage with 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.840
 with bold chocolate coating then 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.660
 from that we withdraw to and the surplus and the 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.370
 dump again the nuts of this 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.040
 way is going to be a hard part 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.830
 the crispy part and the hard part of 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:41.450
 chocolate that is coverage that goes to 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:44.380
 curd and the soft and soft part that 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.360
 will make the interior of these truffles 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.600
 then there and once we have them 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.020
 so we put them in gas pirotines of 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.240
 this way and they are left with little balls 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.740
 super super delicious as you see here already 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.080
