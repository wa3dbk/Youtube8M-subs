00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Violet is a strange color. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.500
 The official name of al-Fafshi is "the magician" and the strange thing 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 About the violet you do not 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 You'll never see the rainbow from 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.320
 The iris arc is supposed to be 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.930
 Full color spectrum 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.310
 So why violet, why the "magente" not 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 Appears in the rainbow? 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.670
 The answer has to do with mixing colors 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.390
 I always had a problem mixing colors, because I know 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.920
 You can not confuse photons together 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 You can not take a blue futon and a green futon 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.190
 And mix them together to get another photon 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 It simply does not happen 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
 But, you can mix colors together in art 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.520
 Mixing colors is something you can certainly play 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.420
 So what is the solution? 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.680
 In fact, you can not mix colors together in physics 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.450
 But you can do that in the neighborhoods 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.950
 It has to do with how your eyes work 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.380
 For example, if I shone a red light and a green light on 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.240
 Your eyes at the same time, if you cut them, you will see .. 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.400
 Yellow! 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.040
 So when you mix red and green together, you get yellow 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 If we look at the spectrum, we find that yellow is between 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.020
 Red and Green 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.140
 So the rule for mixing colors can be 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.420
 When you mix two colors, you get the color between them 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.450
 On the spectrum of colors 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.850
 We can try it again, you'll see me 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.090
 Green and blue together 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 So when you mix the green and the blue together, get the cyan 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.190
 The azimuth is between blue and green on the spectrum of colors 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.830
 So gorgeous, mixing two colors together, you get 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.250
 The color that is between them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.240
 But why, why it? 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.570
 In fact, your eyes can not measure 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.140
 Wavelength of light directly 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.800
 It is not that Foton enters and knows it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.660
 200 nm or whatever and you discover it 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.860
 But you have those conical cells in the back of your eyes 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.980
 They are sensitive to different 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.400
 Parts of the spectrum 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.840
 When a red light enters your eyes there is a set of 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.250
 Cone cells that activate and tell your brain that you are looking at 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.850
 Something red 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.130
 So call these red cells 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.110
 There is another more sensitive group 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470
 To green, when a green light enters your eyes 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.660
 They stimulate and send a message to your brain 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.810
 There are also blue cone cells 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.030
 You have red, green and blue cells 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.120
 So what about yellow? 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.515
 What when you look at a yellow light, like this? 

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:30.110
 In this position, you do not have yellow cone cells. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.760
 So what do you do? 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.850
 In fact yellow is close to red so it is 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.180
 Red cells are slightly stimulated 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.710
 Yellow is also close to green so it is 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.880
 Green cells are slightly stimulated 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390
 Your brain will receive a message from your red cells 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.720
 And green at the same time, decides, well 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.980
 I must see something between these two 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.530
 Two colors permission 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400
 And that's genius, because your brain realizes 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.160
 Something about the world can not 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.765
 To measure it directly 

00:02:55.765 --> 00:03:00.360
 It is not directly sensitive to yellow light 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.530
 That means you can be fooled 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.430
 If you turn red light and green light into your eyes 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.930
 But no yellow light, you will see yellow 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.620
 anyway 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.440
 I have a red lamp and a green lamp and there is not any 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.250
 Light yellow here 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.310
 But when I gather them, I'll see yellow anyway. 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.360
 And television does it all the time 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.100
 If you look close to the television you will see 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.660
 Individual pixels 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.670
 There are red, green and blue pixels 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.540
 These are the only colors your TV produces. After that, they can produce all the other colors. 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.310
 With a trick of mixing those colors. 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.746
 What about violet? 

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.080
 What about the "Magenta"? 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.300
 What your brain is supposed to do if you stimulate the red cell 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.990
 At the tip of the spectrum and the blue cell at 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.280
 The other side, but the green cell did not stimulate? 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.620
 Is he doing the same trick? 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.420
 Do you think he is looking at the color between 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.540
 Red and blue? 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.630
 When the color is between red and blue it is green and you are 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.550
 Definitely do not look at anything green because 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.090
 Your green cells have not been stimulated 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.210
 In that position invent your brain color 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.830
 It creates color and that color is violet 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.730
 And I can show you that in my red and blue kitchens 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.530
 When they meet 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.079
 See the violet. 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.519
 so beautiful. 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.769
 That's why you do not see the violet in the spectrum 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.790
 And do not see the violet in the rainbow because it is not 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.690
 It has a wavelength 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.210
 It is just a lack of green, if you like 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.980
 Just because Eric has a full palette of colors that 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.330
 You can see it on TV 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.070
 When you mix red and blue you get a purple 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.940
 Green and blue give us yellow 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.540
 Green and blue give blue azure 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.230
 And when you mix them all get white 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.015
 When red, green and blue cells are stimulated together 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.620
 You get white light
