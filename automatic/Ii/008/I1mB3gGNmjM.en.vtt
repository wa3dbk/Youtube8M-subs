00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
to have to have another monster effort

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.289 
to have to have another monster effort
by<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.739> line<00:02:25.069> by<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.430> tight<00:02:25.760> ends<00:02:26.090> by<00:02:26.239> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
by the line by the tight ends by the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.030 
by the line by the tight ends by the
running<00:02:26.660> backs<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:27.079> blocking<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.739> group

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
running backs in blocking that group

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.009 
running backs in blocking that group
since<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> first<00:02:29.299> two<00:02:29.390> games<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
since the first two games the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.200 
since the first two games the
linebackers<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> tremendous<00:02:31.099> at<00:02:31.430> home

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
linebackers have a tremendous at home

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.690 
linebackers have a tremendous at home
what<00:02:32.480> are<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.630> thought<00:02:32.810> about<00:02:32.930> them<00:02:36.430> well<00:02:37.430> you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
what are you thought about them well you

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.020 
what are you thought about them well you
know<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.850> think<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:39.250> our<00:02:40.250> linebackers<00:02:41.000> are

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
know I think that our linebackers are

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.390 
know I think that our linebackers are
key<00:02:41.780> key<00:02:42.110> elements<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.770> what<00:02:43.040> we<00:02:43.190> do

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
key key elements to what we do

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.760 
key key elements to what we do
defensively<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.690> passing<00:02:45.200> game<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
defensively in the passing game and the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.520 
defensively in the passing game and the
blitzing<00:02:46.250> game<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.850> run<00:02:47.030> defense<00:02:47.530> all

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
blitzing game and the run defense all

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.320 
blitzing game and the run defense all
that<00:02:48.800> all<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.160> parts<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.790> know<00:02:49.880> they're<00:02:50.120> did

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
that all the parts you know they're did

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.630 
that all the parts you know they're did
it's<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:50.630> really<00:02:50.870> important<00:02:51.560> where<00:02:52.430> they

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
it's just really important where they

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.460 
it's just really important where they
are<00:02:52.820> what<00:02:53.090> they<00:02:53.270> do<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:54.140> group

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
are what they do and I think this group

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.340 
are what they do and I think this group
has<00:02:54.680> done<00:02:54.920> very<00:02:55.160> well<00:02:55.460> and<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.750> know

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
has done very well and you know

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.980 
has done very well and you know
basically<00:02:57.500> four<00:02:58.160> guys<00:02:58.430> have<00:02:58.790> played<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.870> know

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
basically four guys have played you know

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.560 
basically four guys have played you know
most<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.190> football<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.420> then

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
most all the football in there and then

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.270 
most all the football in there and then
because<00:03:02.810> we<00:03:02.960> played<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> lot<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.620> nickel<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.100> lot

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
because we played a lot of nickel a lot

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.240 
because we played a lot of nickel a lot
of<00:03:04.430> dime<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.810> four<00:03:06.500> guys<00:03:06.710> have<00:03:06.980> gotten

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
of dime and so the four guys have gotten

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.640 
of dime and so the four guys have gotten
a<00:03:07.310> lot<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.490> work<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.000> think<00:03:08.270> overall<00:03:08.650> with

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
a lot of work and I think overall with

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.860 
a lot of work and I think overall with
the<00:03:09.800> variety<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.280> offenses<00:03:10.760> we've<00:03:11.180> seen<00:03:11.450> with

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the variety of offenses we've seen with

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.400 
the variety of offenses we've seen with
you<00:03:12.740> know<00:03:12.860> whether<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.460> BYU<00:03:13.970> style<00:03:14.540> or

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
you know whether it's a BYU style or

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.950 
you know whether it's a BYU style or
Wisconsin<00:03:15.800> style<00:03:16.600> opposed<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.840> all<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
Wisconsin style opposed to all the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.750 
Wisconsin style opposed to all the
different<00:03:18.200> spreads<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.100> know<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.430> those

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
different spreads you know that those

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.180 
different spreads you know that those
guys<00:03:19.970> are<00:03:20.150> busy<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.470> think<00:03:21.890> they've<00:03:22.040> done

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
guys are busy and I think they've done

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.390 
guys are busy and I think they've done
pretty<00:03:22.460> well<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.650> odd<00:03:24.770> amount<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.100> time<00:03:25.250> you

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
pretty well the odd amount of time you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.760 
pretty well the odd amount of time you
got<00:03:25.490> 40<00:03:25.790> plays<00:03:26.030> again<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:26.870> know<00:03:26.990> I<00:03:27.020> think<00:03:27.260> that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
got 40 plays again you know I think that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.340 
got 40 plays again you know I think that
you<00:03:28.610> know<00:03:28.730> there<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.510> coaches<00:03:29.780> are<00:03:30.050> doing<00:03:30.290> a

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
nice job of mixing it in we don't have a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.020 
nice job of mixing it in we don't have a
lot<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.500> we're<00:03:33.920> trying<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.190> develop<00:03:34.340> more<00:03:34.880> and

them<00:05:42.390> turn<00:05:42.600> things<00:05:42.870> around<00:05:42.960> physically

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
them turn things around physically

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.640 
them turn things around physically
against<00:05:43.890> BYU<00:05:44.100> and<00:05:44.880> down<00:05:45.090> last<00:05:45.270> year<00:05:45.450> yeah<00:05:46.110> how

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
against BYU and down last year yeah how

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.500 
against BYU and down last year yeah how
much<00:05:46.800> of<00:05:46.980> it<00:05:47.070> is<00:05:47.100> just<00:05:47.430> guys<00:05:47.700> your<00:05:48.300> guys

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
much of it is just guys your guys

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.410 
much of it is just guys your guys
getting<00:05:48.840> older<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.530> stronger

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
getting older and stronger

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.870 
getting older and stronger
John<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.140> think<00:05:51.260> it's<00:05:51.590> two<00:05:51.860> things<00:05:52.160> basically<00:05:52.550> I

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
John I think it's two things basically I

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.210 
John I think it's two things basically I
think<00:05:53.150> experience<00:05:53.600> is<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.020> great<00:05:54.290> thing<00:05:54.530> and<00:05:54.710> I

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
think experience is a great thing and I

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.130 
think experience is a great thing and I
think<00:05:55.250> work<00:05:55.760> is<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.150> other<00:05:56.300> thing<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:56.840> know

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
think work is the other thing you know

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.140 
think work is the other thing you know
and<00:05:57.530> I<00:05:57.590> think<00:05:57.860> our<00:05:57.980> kids<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.820> know<00:05:58.940> got<00:05:59.120> to

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
and I think our kids you know got to

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.210 
and I think our kids you know got to
play<00:05:59.510> and<00:05:59.780> then<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.230> think<00:06:00.560> they<00:06:00.710> found<00:06:01.070> out

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
play and then I think they found out

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.650 
play and then I think they found out
what<00:06:01.400> they<00:06:01.550> needed<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:01.940> they<00:06:02.120> went<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.450> work

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
what they needed and they went to work

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.960 
what they needed and they went to work
you<00:06:03.080> know<00:06:03.200> so<00:06:03.470> I<00:06:03.500> think<00:06:03.620> like<00:06:04.430> in<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.730> lines

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
you know so I think like in the lines

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.060 
you know so I think like in the lines
both<00:06:05.420> lines<00:06:05.720> I<00:06:05.990> think<00:06:06.230> everybody's<00:06:06.740> bigger

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
both lines I think everybody's bigger

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.890 
both lines I think everybody's bigger
faster<00:06:07.640> stronger<00:06:07.910> because<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.510> their<00:06:08.720> work

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
faster stronger because of their work

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.810 
faster stronger because of their work
and<00:06:09.140> then<00:06:09.710> hopefully<00:06:10.010> they<00:06:10.340> use<00:06:10.610> their

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
and then hopefully they use their

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.610 
and then hopefully they use their
experience<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.660> made<00:06:11.840> themselves<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.380> better

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
experience and made themselves a better

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.100 
experience and made themselves a better
player<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.340> if<00:06:14.000> you<00:06:14.180> do<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:14.570> with<00:06:14.780> enough

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
player and if you do that with enough

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.470 
player and if you do that with enough
guys<00:06:15.350> then<00:06:15.890> you<00:06:16.220> can<00:06:16.400> have<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.580> better<00:06:16.790> team<00:06:17.150> and

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
guys then you can have a better team and

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.300 
guys then you can have a better team and
I<00:06:17.900> think<00:06:18.170> that's<00:06:18.950> what<00:06:19.130> we're<00:06:19.280> seeing<00:06:23.800> how<00:06:24.800> big

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
I think that's what we're seeing how big

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.750 
I think that's what we're seeing how big
