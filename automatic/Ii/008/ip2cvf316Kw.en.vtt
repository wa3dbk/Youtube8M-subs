00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
 in times the data sheets was the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.000
 smartphones are becoming more and more similar 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.620
 the manufacturers something to get away from the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 distinguish competition 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 that works either through extreme 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.440
 innovation the middle time but always 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 be harder to find 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.350
 or and that he is much more noticeable 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.150
 away by an independent design 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.160
 material choice rounding colors all this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 are factors that flow into it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.550
 I have many different ones 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.170
 Smartphones like the HTC makes the video 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 home the lg the lg the flex the nokia 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.800
 lumia 15 20 and the galaxy note 3 you 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.309
 cover virtually every point and right there 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.789
 look at each other again 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.469
 We start with the HTC makes fresh 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.860
 in the market it is the current one 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.660
 smartphone 3 it comes in one to 90 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.090
 percent of aluminum existing uni 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 was the case and feels extreme 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 high quality polycarbonate we only find 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 in the two stripes the ones for better 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.310
 The antennas received such a smartphone 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.799
 whose design immediately falls into the eye 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.110
 connoisseurs know from afar that comes 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.630
 from htc everyone else thinks of herself woman 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 may I see 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 it continues with the micro-homesickness like 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 kohls only since last year on the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.799
 German market and has with the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 Heimrecht strong device to a great 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.369
 price thrown on the market 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 surprising are processing and the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.780
 used materials for 350 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.549
 euro ovp we get one 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.520
 aluminum frame and both front as 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.350
 also the back glass the design reminds 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.470
 a mix of iphone and sony 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.970
 ps3 at first glance you bring it 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.250
 maybe not in touch with vico 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.060
 But glass and aluminum are materials 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.290
 the upper class and there too 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.189
 So it does not have to be the man only 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 aluminum 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.840
 in addition to glass and aluminum work the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.240
 manufacturer then even better with plastic 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.460
 said police wonder and here there is 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.799
 probably most of the variants we start 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.990
 however, with the led to is not the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.649
 glossy back of the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.290
 distinctive feature but the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.420
 feel the release in the upper third 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.150
 were brought in loud and quiet 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.860
 expansion is currently only at lg 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.670
 on the back and the field directly 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.530
 in the eye 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.270
 other manufacturers then follow suit 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.550
 I can not say anything but what I say 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.380
 can that after provider so that 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.050
 discover the display pad double cab 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.450
 will prevail 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.070
 the lg flex is also noticeable 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.600
 the series 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.240
 not only because of the polycarbonate and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.340
 not even because of it's the led flex 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.660
 is bent comparable there in 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.490
 Germany so far not 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.650
 and through my experience I can say 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.990
 Everybody really wants to know what's there 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.120
 because it's going on and it really has its 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.310
 benefits while surfing media used and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.990
 Also on the head is not a big difference 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.380
 it when calling but it already has 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.900
 something it is not round you do it 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.700
 easy and overcome smartphones think 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.440
 at least I directly a nokia 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.080
 I think many of you know too 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.209
 that even the polycom square has uni 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.000
 Both housing falls on what one but 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.590
 of course that's the color of course 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.540
 no one else is on the move 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.980
 manufacturer and so has nokia his 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.959
 design niche found 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.580
 and yes the things are indeed 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.330
 matter of taste but they all have 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.489
 something fancy something in and of itself 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.170
 what it does to a samsung they lift 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.420
 characterized by the fact that the back 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 Losing weight already makes you almost 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.780
 alone on the market the special 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.180
 this backside is but that 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.400
 art songs which was processed yes 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.350
 Artificial leather also consists of parts 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.709
 Polycarbonate but it really feels 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.140
 extremely good at i am totally on it 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.360
 In addition, the festivities are striking 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.940
 also so one can of the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.560
 distinguish competition now look 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.510
 we just do some more today 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.340
 pages and in direct comparison 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.370
 just around you also this part of the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.140
 to show smartphones who has which ones 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.510
 installed connections and what has the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.610
 manufacturer thought the approval 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.440
 lg flex also wants one more time 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.269
 be considered and thus again that 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.620
 complete whole and yet 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.810
 once the keypad on the 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 on the front 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.709
 that, too, plays a big role in this 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.810
 design 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.860
 Here you can choose between 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.440
 electronic buttons below the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.660
 displays three buttons at the bottom of the display 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.389
 three buttons so this three on screen 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.669
 keys in a different order 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.710
 one physical and two electronic 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.120
 buttons below the displays and how 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.219
 already at the beginning of three electronic 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.729
 buttons below the display 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:33.499
 So what would be smartphone to be 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.909
 design plays an important role in 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.830
 manufacturer wants it from the 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.779
 Distinguish competition and the buyer 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.580
 Can be made of unbelievably many designs 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.300
 choose and find exactly what he wants 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.099
 like 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.889
 in the material you choose between 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.590
 aluminum glass and possibly salvaged 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.759
 polycarbonate and also the colors play 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.400
 a major role 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.810
 in addition comes the position of the buttons around 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.960
 around the housing and especially the 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.150
 front fullscreen speaker 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.250
 Physical buttons The selection is great 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.110
 since you can forward pack really much back 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.039
 and so will it this year 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.229
 go on 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.430
 you do not have to design yourself 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.960
 determine the tastes are 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.879
 different and that's why there is 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.129
 not that either 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.069
 Everything has its pros and cons and 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.659
 We have to live with it 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.520
 then only another question in the space 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.620
 which design do you wish 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.419
 what does your dream smartphone consist of ? 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.789
 is there an alternative material like 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.039
 wood for example or like it 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.009
 current selection I'm curious 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.229
 that was now from me and this video for 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:37.689
 smartphone design 2014 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.689
 thank you for your time is good
