00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.230
 would you have heard that next August 27 the severe red planet of 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:06.860
 same size as the moon 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.219
 imagine you are strange landscape with two huge celestial bodies 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.289
 lighting the terrestrial nights 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.339
 we are sure that it would be wonderful before our eyes when 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.779
 we turn to the sky we notice the glow of our natural satellite 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.689
 and the irradiation of the reds of Mars 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.659
 awesome do not believe it 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.710
 but what would happen to our race being so close on the planet Mars to the 

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:30.649
 land 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.259
 the agency consequences of the general strike so far this season 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.140
 for its part it will approach 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.740
 the milestone of 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.010
 the boss of al qaeda 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.760
 efe 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.629
 2000 two hundred times greater 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.600
 that the attraction that exerts after the moon on the sea and then the base to 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.629
 the quality in the lorca form of the banks from the situation of the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.630
 costs for which his family a tide according to low because on Tuesday 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.590
 along with the gravitation of the muller slice faced a proactive attitude 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.620
 local rts s 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.200
 the result a devastating natural catastrophe never before seen by the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.580
 humanity 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 could change forever the lifestyle of the human being that 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.880
 they would disappear 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.560
 many this 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 who are used to living 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.540
 near 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.060
 the coasts 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.430
 it's because now the tabo a would retire 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 certain three meters of the pit therefore all certainty your species would suffer 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.470
 this is therefore also there would be important telluric effects all be 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.870
 movements for seismic effects without charging 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.090
 the return of March its normal position 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.090
 it would also bring serious consequences on our planet 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 as the marlins revise their position in a violent way causing tsunamis 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.729
 tsunamis 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.130
 finally they would put our species at risk but not to the degree that it is similar 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.670
 the corpse of your baby 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.490
 despite the examples of exclusive use 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.960
 finished with 12 units 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.100
 kemba walker an earthquake also 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.050
 the same thing happens at the most with the city of Mexico as the last times 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.259
 after many days they are supposed to 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.019
 there are people arrested 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.209
 behind that court but good reason for him quite 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.189
 meanwhile ford 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.829
 however earlier in the reason why the provinces continue with the 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.479
 studies of objects in the solar system of objects in galaxies of objects in 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.229
 emulators of this very distant object 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.209
 because we know that the blonde has always been a science of survival 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.699
 for the fortune of the Kirchner 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.810
 this planet 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.430
 the approach of Mars to the earth is just a rumor that has circulated in 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.049
 Internet 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.079
 for more than ten years and that is becoming stronger in the mail 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.709
 electronic social networks kip those from this electronic information source 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.459
 that sometimes only seeks to confuse readers with erroneous data in 1993 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.829
 brad pitt of mars and the earth get an approach that will not happen 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.419
 revel fifty thousand years before Christ quique reoccurs until 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:18.620
 the year two thousand 278 since Tuesday was - well almost 53 million 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.259
 kilometers away from the earth 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.139
 from the federation it was established that if you are going to see 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.389
 very big 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.569
 however today six years later then there is no such situation in that 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.749
 occasion the size of the moon was seen 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:37.329
 nor will it turn to any case to achieve the size of the moon and much 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.859
 less on the date that is being commented on August 27 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.370
 on August 27, part 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.180
 it is about 262 million kilometers away from the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.379
 planet Earth 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.439
 and it is required 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.820
 arrive on January 27, 2010 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.219
 so that this one only 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.649
 89 million kilometers 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:06.339
 which caused such a situation now you are well informed about 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.749
 the supposed approach of Mars to the Earth 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.949
 and surely and every time I receive an email of this type look 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.530
 and investigate more of the subject before being alarmed by supposed catastrophes or 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.720
 natural phenomena
