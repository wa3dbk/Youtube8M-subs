00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.140
 the model 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.860
 d 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.860
 7 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.090
 today I present a new 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.470
 video of the kitchens so I really like 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 and cooking videos for the boat 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.630
 because it gives you lots of ideas for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 rest then lunches or lunches 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.689
 something like that no I like 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.489
 really it's filming you videos of 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.960
 to cook for sure that this respect video 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.670
 speak to each other nails because I try to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.830
 make a montage always a little fast 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.970
 and story to present the very thing 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.920
 quickly because it's always a 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.739
 little nicer than to spend five 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.580
 minutes on how to cut a sentence that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.690
 that is my opinion 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.480
 but here is today I 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.460
 was there at the port a figure 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 just not really I thought like 3d 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.630
 but in a delicate things 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 different so that's why I'm more so 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.489
 these 5 or 3d so I think I paid 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.050
 Dear Santa
