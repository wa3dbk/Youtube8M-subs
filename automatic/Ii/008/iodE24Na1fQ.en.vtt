yeah<00:00:34.740> usually<00:00:35.720> just<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:37.970> positive<00:00:38.970> problem

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:50.180 

this<00:00:43.830> is<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.520> locking<00:00:47.520> mechanism<00:00:48.980> just<00:00:49.980> turn

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
this is the locking mechanism just turn

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.140 
this is the locking mechanism just turn
the<00:00:50.309> key<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:50.730> here

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
the key right here

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.479 
the key right here
and<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.850> unlock<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> steering<00:00:54.629> wheel

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489

and it will unlock the steering wheel
but<00:00:56.489> inside<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> here<00:01:00.140> little<00:01:01.140> tabs<00:01:03.260> like<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
but inside so here little tabs like to

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.100 
but inside so here little tabs like to
break<00:01:04.680> off<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:08.250> leaves<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.360> no

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
break off and that leaves you with no

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
break off and that leaves you with no
steering<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.800> all<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.630> you're<00:01:12.630> probably<00:01:13.640> just

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
steering at all and you're probably just

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.450 
steering at all and you're probably just
going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> hit<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> brakes<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.460> hope

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
going to have to hit the brakes and hope

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.280 
going to have to hit the brakes and hope
for<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> best

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.490 

stall<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.590> unit<00:01:26.300> another<00:01:27.300> BMW<00:01:27.930> unit<00:01:28.140> and

stall here unit another BMW unit and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
stall here unit another BMW unit and
hopefully<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.520> gives<00:01:29.729> them<00:01:29.940> more

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
hopefully this one gives them more

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.180 
hopefully this one gives them more
mileage<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.430> steer<00:01:32.880> their<00:01:33.060> car

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.610 

you<00:01:46.820> can<00:01:47.030> remove<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:47.870> whole<00:01:48.050> thing<00:01:48.260> without

you can remove this whole thing without
unplugging<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.370> airbag<00:01:49.730> it<00:01:50.060> would<00:01:50.210> make<00:01:50.570> it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
unplugging the airbag it would make it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.570 
unplugging the airbag it would make it

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
easier don't have to reset anything and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.160 
easier don't have to reset anything and
make<00:01:56.030> sure<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.270> steering<00:01:56.690> wheel's<00:01:56.840> points

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170

straight ahead and the tires make sure

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.460 
straight ahead and the tires make sure
that<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.160> mark<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:03.050> you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.260> put<00:02:03.380> it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
that you mark this so you can put it

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.650 
that you mark this so you can put it
back<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> same<00:02:04.160> way

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.300 

it's<00:02:09.260> not<00:02:09.500> too<00:02:10.190> bad<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.650> only<00:02:12.680> part<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.130> I

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
it's not too bad the only part that I

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:24.670 
it's not too bad the only part that I
don't<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:18.370> newer<00:02:19.370> units

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.020 

see<00:02:25.310> these<00:02:25.489> funny-looking<00:02:25.970> screws<00:02:26.659> here

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.650 

see<00:02:34.600> how<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.700> torques

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
see how they have that torques

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.890 
see how they have that torques
that

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.259 
that
that<00:02:41.560> middle<00:02:41.890> part<00:02:42.040> snaps<00:02:42.459> off<00:02:42.730> once<00:02:43.090> it's

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
that middle part snaps off once it's

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.520 
that middle part snaps off once it's
tightened

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.429 

then<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.650> looks<00:02:51.799> like<00:02:51.890> something<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:52.610> this

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
then it looks like something like this

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.679 
then it looks like something like this
snaps<00:02:54.439> off<00:02:54.739> what<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:55.909> to<00:02:56.000> do<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.299> loosen

and<00:03:11.460> punch<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.450> hole<00:03:12.630> or<00:03:13.260> punch<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.220> divot

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.610 

in<00:03:17.409> there<00:03:17.680> three<00:03:18.219> spots<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.939> just<00:03:19.500> break<00:03:20.500> it

loose with a hammer slowly rotate it and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.819 
loose with a hammer slowly rotate it and
then<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.799> won't<00:03:23.890> come<00:03:24.159> out

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
then it won't come out

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.539
