00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
you compare me to a person like mr. Shah

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.469 
you compare me to a person like mr. Shah
Rukh<00:01:20.859> Khan<00:01:21.039> who<00:01:21.520> has<00:01:21.549> a<00:01:21.640> great<00:01:21.909> body<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.299> work

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
Rukh Khan who has a great body of work

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.209 
Rukh Khan who has a great body of work
behind<00:01:22.659> him<00:01:22.869> he<00:01:22.929> has<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:23.079> lot<00:01:23.289> of<00:01:23.319> years<00:01:23.619> he's

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
behind him he has a lot of years he's

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.529 
behind him he has a lot of years he's
worked<00:01:24.460> hard<00:01:24.609> and<00:01:24.759> reached<00:01:24.969> by<00:01:25.119> years<00:01:25.359> today

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
worked hard and reached by years today

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.660 
worked hard and reached by years today
so<00:01:26.289> I<00:01:26.319> think<00:01:26.439> it<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.619> belittling<00:01:27.100> his<00:01:27.249> stardom

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
so I think it is belittling his stardom

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.309 
so I think it is belittling his stardom
by<00:01:27.909> comparing<00:01:28.390> him<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.539> me<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:29.049> I<00:01:29.259> think

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
by comparing him to me and I think

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.440 
by comparing him to me and I think
that's<00:01:29.469> very<00:01:29.649> unfair<00:01:30.009> towards<00:01:30.520> him<00:01:30.700> it's

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
that's very unfair towards him it's

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.999 
that's very unfair towards him it's
overly<00:01:31.990> fair<00:01:32.170> towards<00:01:32.319> me<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.649> mean<00:01:32.829> you<00:01:32.889> guys

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
overly fair towards me I mean you guys

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.039 
overly fair towards me I mean you guys
are<00:01:33.189> just<00:01:33.249> being<00:01:33.340> extra<00:01:33.700> nice<00:01:33.819> towards<00:01:34.149> me<00:01:34.270> but

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
are just being extra nice towards me but

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:35.910 
are just being extra nice towards me but
it's<00:01:35.170> something<00:01:35.229> which<00:01:35.499> I<00:01:35.590> don't<00:01:35.770> think

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
it's something which I don't think

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.230 
it's something which I don't think
seriously<00:01:36.130> because<00:01:36.490> unless<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.850> don't<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.179> don't

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
seriously because unless I don't I don't

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.179 
seriously because unless I don't I don't
