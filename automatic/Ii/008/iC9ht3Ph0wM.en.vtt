and the reason why it's taking me a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.809 
and the reason why it's taking me a
little<00:02:23.709> while<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.159> because<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.549> to<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:24.790> a

little while is because I have to put a

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:34.360

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.559 

you<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.319> also<00:02:50.439> get<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.769> comp<00:02:51.099> at<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.329> with

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569
