00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
might be able to handle well enough plus

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.880 
might be able to handle well enough plus
I<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.560> hoping<00:01:47.119> by<00:01:48.119> chance<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> didn't

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
I was hoping by chance that I didn't

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
I was hoping by chance that I didn't
change<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.310> registeel<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> still<00:01:51.600> had

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
change my registeel and that I still had

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
change my registeel and that I still had
stealth<00:01:52.049> rock<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.670> didn't

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
stealth rock on this but this didn't

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.219 
stealth rock on this but this didn't
have<00:01:54.119> stealth<00:01:54.360> rock<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> can't<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.110> up

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
have stealth rock so I can't get up

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
have stealth rock so I can't get up
stealth<00:01:55.470> rocks<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:57.000> only

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
stealth rocks here so really my only

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.760 
stealth rocks here so really my only
choice<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.840> boom<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.560> thing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
choice is just boom on this thing

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.520 
choice is just boom on this thing
because<00:01:59.630> otherwise<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.960> gonna<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.229> annoying

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
because otherwise it's gonna be annoying

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.499 
because otherwise it's gonna be annoying
threat<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> might<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:02.880> well<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.180> rid<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
threat so I might as well get rid of it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.929 
threat so I might as well get rid of it
right<00:02:03.570> off<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> bat<00:02:04.280> registeel<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.579> mean<00:02:05.820> it's

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
right off the bat registeel I mean it's

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
right off the bat registeel I mean it's
like<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.119> might<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.329> useful<00:02:06.540> might<00:02:06.899> not<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.229> but

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
like it might be useful might not be but

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
like it might be useful might not be but
I'd<00:02:07.649> rather<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.160> zapped<00:02:08.399> us<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I'd rather just get zapped us out of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
I'd rather just get zapped us out of the
way<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.660> does<00:02:09.810> die<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.440> was<00:02:10.679> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
way and it does die because it was a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.020 
way and it does die because it was a
life-form<00:02:11.039> zapdos<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
I'm like all right cool table you can do

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.740 
I'm like all right cool table you can do
something<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.430> crit<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.940> double<00:03:31.239> edge<00:03:31.360> on<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
something I crit the double edge on the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.420 
something I crit the double edge on the
sand<00:03:31.989> /<00:03:32.170> I<00:03:32.440> probably<00:03:32.739> should<00:03:32.950> run<00:03:33.190> for<00:03:33.280> grass

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
sand / I probably should run for grass

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.979 
sand / I probably should run for grass
not<00:03:33.640> anyways<00:03:33.910> cuz<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.299> zoo<00:03:34.420> Morel<00:03:34.660> was<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.870> i

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
not anyways cuz in a zoo Morel was up i

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.810 
not anyways cuz in a zoo Morel was up i
guess<00:03:35.049> i<00:03:35.320> was<00:03:35.799> also<00:03:36.040> half<00:03:36.250> predicting<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
guess i was also half predicting a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.280 
guess i was also half predicting a
switch<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.450> i<00:03:37.480> guess<00:03:37.660> that's<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.900> thing<00:03:38.110> too

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
switch so i guess that's the thing too

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.220 
switch so i guess that's the thing too
but<00:03:39.100> uh<00:03:39.180> now<00:03:40.180> i<00:03:40.209> can<00:03:40.480> go<00:03:40.540> for<00:03:40.690> grass<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.019> on<00:03:41.079> it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
but uh now i can go for grass and on it

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.580 
but uh now i can go for grass and on it
so<00:03:41.950> i<00:03:42.579> can<00:03:42.970> take<00:03:43.120> out<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.540> sand<00:03:43.810> /<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.380> it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
so i can take out the sand / and it

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.690 
so i can take out the sand / and it
probably<00:03:44.799> would<00:03:44.980> have<00:03:45.070> died<00:03:45.220> anyways<00:03:45.579> even

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
probably would have died anyways even

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.890 
probably would have died anyways even
without<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.150> crib<00:03:46.329> from<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.600> double<00:03:46.810> edge

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
without the crib from the double edge

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.199 
without the crib from the double edge
style<00:03:47.140> whatever<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:47.859> kill<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.910> that's

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
style whatever but I kill it so that's

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.340 
style whatever but I kill it so that's
all<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.450> matters<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:49.900> he<00:03:50.019> did<00:03:50.140> get<00:03:50.230> that

feel like showing him that it's actually
grass<00:05:14.830> as<00:05:15.099> opposed<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:16.349> electric<00:05:17.349> because<00:05:17.590> I

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
grass as opposed to electric because I

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.649 
grass as opposed to electric because I
was<00:05:17.949> like<00:05:18.069> gonna<00:05:18.430> poke<00:05:18.729> and<00:05:18.879> yet<00:05:19.000> in<00:05:19.120> check<00:05:19.389> I

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
was like gonna poke and yet in check I

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.089 
was like gonna poke and yet in check I
mean<00:05:20.289> that<00:05:20.409> like<00:05:20.529> it<00:05:20.620> would<00:05:20.740> really<00:05:20.979> matter

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
mean that like it would really matter

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.499 
mean that like it would really matter
we're<00:05:21.400> just<00:05:21.580> surfed<00:05:21.759> again<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.090> was<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.240> huge

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
we're just surfed again it was a huge

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.390 
we're just surfed again it was a huge
deal<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:22.870> also<00:05:23.199> there<00:05:23.529> was<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.830> off<00:05:24.039> chance

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
deal but also there was that off chance

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.519 
deal but also there was that off chance
my<00:05:24.580> poor<00:05:24.789> Anne<00:05:24.909> came<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.330> but<00:05:25.930> highly<00:05:26.229> doubt<00:05:26.379> he

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
my poor Anne came in but highly doubt he

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.249 
my poor Anne came in but highly doubt he
doubted<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.370> would<00:05:27.400> so<00:05:28.060> whatever<00:05:28.419> but<00:05:28.719> now

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
doubted it would so whatever but now

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.800 
doubted it would so whatever but now
basically<00:05:29.770> what<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.009> comes<00:05:30.099> down<00:05:30.279> to<00:05:30.580> is<00:05:30.819> he<00:05:31.690> is

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
basically what it comes down to is he is

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.969 
basically what it comes down to is he is
faster<00:05:32.139> now<00:05:32.259> because<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.469> choice<00:05:32.710> scarf

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
faster now because a choice scarf

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.159 
faster now because a choice scarf
basically<00:05:33.550> he<00:05:34.300> needs<00:05:34.479> to<00:05:34.599> stay<00:05:34.750> asleep<00:05:34.930> this

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
basically he needs to stay asleep this

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.170 
basically he needs to stay asleep this
entire<00:05:35.409> time<00:05:35.620> otherwise<00:05:36.099> I'm<00:05:36.460> gonna<00:05:36.879> get

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
entire time otherwise I'm gonna get

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.110 
entire time otherwise I'm gonna get
screwed<00:05:37.629> so<00:05:38.199> hard<00:05:38.400> cuz<00:05:39.400> with<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.699> toxic

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
screwed so hard cuz with that toxic

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.339 
screwed so hard cuz with that toxic
there's<00:05:40.330> no<00:05:40.479> way<00:05:40.599> I'm<00:05:40.659> really<00:05:40.900> gonna<00:05:41.020> install

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
there's no way I'm really gonna install

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.499 
there's no way I'm really gonna install
them<00:05:41.500> but<00:05:41.650> so<00:05:41.860> far<00:05:42.039> so<00:05:42.129> good<00:05:42.250> as<00:05:43.000> far<00:05:43.270> as<00:05:43.300> him

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
them but so far so good as far as him

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.290 
them but so far so good as far as him
staying<00:05:43.750> asleep<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.759> him<00:05:45.759> with<00:05:45.909> another<00:05:46.060> one

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
staying asleep so him with another one

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.999 
staying asleep so him with another one
does<00:05:46.990> not<00:05:47.169> look<00:05:47.289> like<00:05:47.349> another<00:05:47.650> one<00:05:47.740> will<00:05:47.919> take

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
does not look like another one will take

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.110 
does not look like another one will take
them<00:05:48.129> out<00:05:48.190> some<00:05:48.370> kind<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.580> just<00:05:48.759> hoping<00:05:48.940> for

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
them out some kind of just hoping for

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
electric from him so i'm assuming it's

but<00:05:58.089> I<00:05:58.300> just<00:05:58.419> go<00:05:58.539> for<00:05:58.599> another<00:05:58.719> HP<00:05:59.529> grass<00:05:59.860> on

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
but I just go for another HP grass on

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.589 
but I just go for another HP grass on
yeah<00:06:01.689> I<00:06:01.960> keep<00:06:02.889> accidentally<00:06:03.789> saying<00:06:04.449> too

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
yeah I keep accidentally saying too

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.360 
yeah I keep accidentally saying too
early<00:06:04.930> man<00:06:05.050> always<00:06:05.379> the<00:06:05.860> out<00:06:06.009> of<00:06:06.039> me<00:06:06.129> but

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
early man always the out of me but

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.179 
early man always the out of me but
I<00:06:06.930> do<00:06:07.930> not<00:06:08.080> kill<00:06:08.379> it<00:06:08.529> with<00:06:08.620> HP<00:06:08.889> guys<00:06:09.009> right

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
I do not kill it with HP guys right

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:10.499 
I do not kill it with HP guys right
there<00:06:09.219> some<00:06:09.490> hoping<00:06:09.819> he<00:06:09.879> stays<00:06:09.909> asleep<00:06:10.180> again

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
there some hoping he stays asleep again

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.480 
there some hoping he stays asleep again
but<00:06:10.810> actually<00:06:11.710> that's<00:06:11.830> probably<00:06:11.979> maximum

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
but actually that's probably maximum

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.760 
but actually that's probably maximum
sleep<00:06:12.669> turns<00:06:12.879> there<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:13.419> yeah<00:06:14.409> I<00:06:14.439> guess<00:06:14.589> he's

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
sleep turns there so yeah I guess he's

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.649 
sleep turns there so yeah I guess he's
gonna<00:06:14.889> wake<00:06:15.069> up<00:06:15.219> but<00:06:15.490> he<00:06:15.669> wakes<00:06:15.849> up<00:06:16.000> kills<00:06:16.479> me

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
gonna wake up but he wakes up kills me

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.079 
gonna wake up but he wakes up kills me
