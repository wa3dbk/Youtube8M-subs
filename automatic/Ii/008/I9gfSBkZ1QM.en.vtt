a<00:00:03.360> sand<00:00:03.959> mold<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.650> created<00:00:05.250> by<00:00:05.430> packing<00:00:06.029> sand

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
a sand mold is created by packing sand

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.430 
a sand mold is created by packing sand
on<00:00:07.230> top<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.830> styrofoam<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:09.059> use<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.780> process

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
on top of the styrofoam I use a process

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.270 
on top of the styrofoam I use a process
with<00:00:11.280> sodium<00:00:12.090> silicates<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.809> which<00:00:13.740> has<00:00:14.250> been

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
with sodium silicates and which has been

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.939 
with sodium silicates and which has been
adapted<00:00:14.730> from<00:00:15.269> industry<00:00:16.170> really<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.650> sodium

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
adapted from industry really it's sodium

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.970 
adapted from industry really it's sodium
silicate<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.699> carbon<00:00:18.240> dioxide<00:00:18.560> very<00:00:19.560> similar

the city and sorted based sand sometimes
I<00:00:31.019> use<00:00:31.230> an<00:00:31.439> olivine<00:00:32.040> basing<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.270> very

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
I use an olivine basing this is all very

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.389 
I use an olivine basing this is all very
technical<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.110> these<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.890> different<00:00:35.190> types

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
technical but these are different types

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.240 
technical but these are different types
of<00:00:35.550> sand<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.809> best<00:00:36.989> way<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> I've<00:00:37.500> found<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
of sand the best way that I've found to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.510 
of sand the best way that I've found to
describe<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> someone<00:00:39.450> who<00:00:39.690> doesn't<00:00:39.899> know

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
describe it to someone who doesn't know

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
describe it to someone who doesn't know
the<00:00:41.520> process<00:00:42.739> it's<00:00:43.739> very<00:00:44.010> much<00:00:44.250> akin<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the process it's very much akin to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.029 
the process it's very much akin to
casting<00:00:45.360> bronze<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:46.590> how<00:00:46.710> does<00:00:46.770> people

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
casting bronze because how does people

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.459 
casting bronze because how does people
have<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:48.120> idea<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.690> casting<00:00:49.170> bronze

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
have some idea that casting bronze

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.340 
have some idea that casting bronze
involves<00:00:50.149> pouring<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.420> very<00:00:51.690> hot<00:00:52.020> molten

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
involves pouring this very hot molten

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.040 
involves pouring this very hot molten
material<00:00:53.250> into<00:00:54.090> some<00:00:54.360> kind<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> sand<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.379> form

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
material into some kind of sand or form

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
material into some kind of sand or form
glasses<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> process<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.090> similar<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.660> hot

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
glasses the process is similar the hot

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.189 
glasses the process is similar the hot
shop<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.440> me<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> foundry

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
shop to me is much more like a foundry

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.600 
shop to me is much more like a foundry
except<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.500> quite<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.010> dirty<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
except that it's not quite as dirty as a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.830 
except that it's not quite as dirty as a
foundry<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.590> end<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> mass<00:01:08.250> mass<00:01:09.150> flows

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
foundry and at end the mass mass flows

foundry and at end the mass mass flows
very<00:01:10.200> slowly<00:01:11.510> compared<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.630> metal<00:01:12.960> metal<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
very slowly compared to metal metal is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
very slowly compared to metal metal is
it's<00:01:14.310> liquid<00:01:15.770> flows<00:01:16.820> very<00:01:17.820> quickly<00:01:18.090> like

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it's liquid flows very quickly like

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's liquid flows very quickly like
water<00:01:19.009> glass<00:01:20.009> flows<00:01:20.460> very<00:01:20.729> slowly<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:22.159> describe

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
water glass flows very slowly I describe

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.240 
water glass flows very slowly I describe
it<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.909> hot<00:01:24.240> honey<00:01:24.659> uh-huh<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.040> that's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it as like hot honey uh-huh so that's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
it as like hot honey uh-huh so that's
kind<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> movement<00:01:27.180> hot<00:01:27.479> honey<00:01:27.720> or

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
kind of the movement hot honey or

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.109 
kind of the movement hot honey or
perhaps<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.979> movement<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> cast<00:01:29.850> glass

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
perhaps the movement of the cast glass

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
perhaps the movement of the cast glass
you<00:01:30.360> could<00:01:30.540> compare<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.950> were

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you could compare it to if you were

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.880 
you could compare it to if you were
making<00:01:32.340> fake<00:01:32.909> candied<00:01:33.360> apples<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> candy

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
making fake candied apples and the candy

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.410 
making fake candied apples and the candy
you<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.369> sugar<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.150> right

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you get that sugar into that right

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
you get that sugar into that right
temperature<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.079> pick<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
temperature and pick that up you have to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
temperature and pick that up you have to
see<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:39.750> symbols<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:40.560> yeah<00:01:40.979> that's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
see it as symbols all right yeah that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
see it as symbols all right yeah that's
the<00:01:41.939> temperature<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.470> want<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> glass

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the temperature that you want the glass

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.660 
the temperature that you want the glass
and<00:01:44.369> that's<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.840> 2,400<00:01:45.840> degrees<00:01:46.430> I'm<00:01:47.430> sick

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and that's about 2,400 degrees I'm sick

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.389 
and that's about 2,400 degrees I'm sick
pretty<00:01:48.090> hot<00:01:48.509> takes<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.049> lot<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> gas<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> lot

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
pretty hot takes a lot of gas and a lot

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.760 
pretty hot takes a lot of gas and a lot
of<00:01:50.430> electricity<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.899> furnace<00:01:52.259> stays<00:01:52.530> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
of electricity and the furnace stays on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.819 
of electricity and the furnace stays on
all<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.780> back<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.110> actual<00:01:55.470> mold

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
all the time so back to the actual mold

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550 
all the time so back to the actual mold
making<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.700> sweep<00:01:56.939> act<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> sand<00:01:57.930> the

ever<00:02:02.009> alike<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.390> styrofoam<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.500> use<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> few

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
ever alike the styrofoam I can use a few

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.069 
ever alike the styrofoam I can use a few
times<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.729> usually<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.180> destroyed<00:02:06.750> after

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
times that usually it's destroyed after

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.790 
times that usually it's destroyed after
a<00:02:07.680> few<00:02:07.950> uses<00:02:08.569> then

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
a few uses then

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.140 
a few uses then
this<00:02:10.040> is<00:02:10.570> mold<00:02:11.590> that's<00:02:12.590> hard<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.760> carve

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
this is mold that's hard and I can carve

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.450 
this is mold that's hard and I can carve
into<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> lot<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.800> carvings<00:02:16.370> that

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
into it so a lot of the carvings that

surface are actually hand carved into

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.930 
surface are actually hand carved into
the<00:02:23.750> mold<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.260> negative<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:24.950> Reverse<00:02:25.370> all

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the mold in the negative in Reverse all

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.210 
the mold in the negative in Reverse all
right<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.930> mold<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.290> prepared<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
right the mold is prepared so that the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.730 
right the mold is prepared so that the
glass<00:02:28.430> will<00:02:28.940> not<00:02:29.120> stick<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.960> sand<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
glass will not stick to the sand and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.970 
glass will not stick to the sand and
then<00:02:31.070> color<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.700> laid<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.860> depending<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
then color is laid in depending on the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.790 
then color is laid in depending on the
size<00:02:34.250> of<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.580> piece<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.140> take<00:02:36.380> one

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
size of the piece it can take one

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.280 
size of the piece it can take one
assistant<00:02:37.430> or<00:02:37.640> perhaps<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.420> many<00:02:38.600> for<00:02:39.200> the
