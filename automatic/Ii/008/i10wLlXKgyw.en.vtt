00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.640
 the first 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.169
 or the person should introduce you to tell you what you did recently 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.209
 we have to have a camera phone is cool because it is practical 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.330
 and easy to load as we are seeing how much a camera with to be compact 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.599
 without losing quality image points 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.509
 This year's cccc is very small and lightweight it is only eight centimeters 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.039
 width by 5 centimeters in height and its thickness go to both 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.069
 centimeters 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.050
 wild until it was not much smaller than that of other female singers 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.920
 the market with two 5-inch dots of its single defect if it is 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.130
 what can we call this? 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.260
 others should also enter what has made the task of photographed in the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.050
 beach with very strong sun 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.360
 we have no choice to choose the equivalent of a wide angle nor 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.030
 so large so only 38 mm 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.470
 This complicates a bit for the photo the little boys but until it is born 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.170
 work around the problem but when different angles rumor that it has a 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.600
 serious deviation but at the aperture with the lens closing is done therein 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.340
 this lens as it has been said has no vote but makes available a 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 visualization and digital editing all control of tablets 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 but it is easy to see the evident granulation of the image 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.160
 your focus is tense so do not even think about mato formats the idea is that actually 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.190
 it's a lot more camera-oriented than the ones you can leave 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.600
 always ready inside the bag or backpack with any situation 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.470
 the controls are very practical monochrome you can still 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.990
 adjust some point of hyperconsumption exposure beyond the trash that goes up 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.770
 800 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.680
 but in scene modes that will look nothing is basically look and squeeze 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 she also film resolution of 640 by 480 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.040
 even so simply the photographers did not disappoint is not 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.220
 recommended for more critical photographers this award details but for 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.040
 anyone who wants an easy-to-operate campaign is imported from here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.610
 works with two toothpick batteries that are consumed very quickly so you can 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.190
 think of a pair of reserves and rechargeable 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.150
 to leave the paper later this month 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.300
 how will the information on the hiking trail and producer be on our site 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.290
 the first
