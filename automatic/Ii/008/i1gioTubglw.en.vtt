we're going to use the ball of her eye
as<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.920> guide<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:53.480> I'm<00:00:53.720> taking<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.200> brush<00:00:54.440> and

her eye as the guide making sure that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.600 
her eye as the guide making sure that
that<00:01:11.119> tone<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.259> really<00:01:12.830> pressed<00:01:13.160> into<00:01:13.460> her

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
that tone is really pressed into her

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.490 
that tone is really pressed into her
skin<00:01:13.970> it's<00:01:14.300> going<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.630> last<00:01:14.840> longer<00:01:15.020> it's

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
that we talked about before I did wet

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.250 
that we talked about before I did wet
the<00:01:52.670> brush<00:01:52.790> again<00:01:53.180> because<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.600> want<00:01:53.900> something

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
the brush again because I want something

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
a little bit stronger and we're gonna

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.070 
a little bit stronger and we're gonna
create<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.540> very<00:01:56.870> fine<00:01:57.200> line<00:01:57.680> under<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.370> eye

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.749 

you<00:02:03.080> want<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.320> be<00:02:03.409> very<00:02:03.710> careful<00:02:04.310> about<00:02:04.430> how

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
you want to be very careful about how

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.570 
you want to be very careful about how
fast<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.420> work<00:02:05.600> under<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.049> eyes<00:02:06.170> because<00:02:06.799> we

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
fast you work under the eyes because we

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.400 
fast you work under the eyes because we
we<00:02:07.850> are<00:02:08.030> still<00:02:08.270> working<00:02:08.479> with<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.810> powder<00:02:09.080> you

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
we are still working with a powder you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.170 
we are still working with a powder you
want<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.429> make<00:02:10.550> sure<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.880> you're<00:02:11.030> not

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
want to make sure that you're not

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.570 
want to make sure that you're not
putting<00:02:11.709> giving<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.800> chance<00:02:13.040> where<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> lot<00:02:13.550> of

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
putting giving the chance where a lot of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.690 
putting giving the chance where a lot of
powder<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:14.060> fly<00:02:14.239> around<00:02:14.420> into<00:02:14.840> your<00:02:15.020> eye<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
powder to fly around into your eye that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820 
powder to fly around into your eye that
also<00:02:16.910> helps<00:02:17.540> though<00:02:17.810> by<00:02:18.200> having<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> brush

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
also helps though by having the brush

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.800 
also helps though by having the brush
wet<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.370> helps<00:02:19.670> keeping<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> powder<00:02:20.330> down<00:02:20.569> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
wet it helps keeping the powder down to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:31.380 
wet it helps keeping the powder down to
a<00:02:20.840> minimum

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.360 

so<00:02:32.200> next<00:02:32.410> up<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:32.890> we're<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.250> be

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
going to use the very tip the first step

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.720 
going to use the very tip the first step
that<00:03:32.410> we're<00:03:32.709> going<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.430> we're<00:03:33.580> going<00:03:33.670> to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
that we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.600 
that we're going to do is we're going to
create<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.209> bottom<00:03:34.450> half<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:36.130> wingtip

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
create the bottom half of the wingtip

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.120 
create the bottom half of the wingtip
and<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.180> point<00:03:37.510> will<00:03:37.720> allow<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.739> give<00:03:38.890> us<00:03:39.010> a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
and that point will allow and give us a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.820 
and that point will allow and give us a
great<00:03:39.280> guide<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:40.150> how<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.870> finish<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.680> how

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
great guide on how to finish and how

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.190 
great guide on how to finish and how
much<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.100> an<00:03:42.190> angle<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.760> use<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.780> I've<00:03:43.870> taken<00:03:44.049> my

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
much of an angle to use so I've taken my

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.320 
much of an angle to use so I've taken my
brush<00:03:44.560> I've<00:03:44.860> dipped<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.790> little<00:03:46.090> bit<00:03:46.209> of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
brush I've dipped just a little bit of

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.479 
brush I've dipped just a little bit of
gray<00:03:46.570> just<00:03:47.200> just<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.709> little<00:03:47.980> bit<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.160> graphite

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
gray just just a little bit of graphite

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.340 
gray just just a little bit of graphite
on<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.820> tip<00:03:49.030> there<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.540> we're<00:03:49.810> gonna<00:03:49.930> start

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
on the tip there and we're gonna start

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.590 
on the tip there and we're gonna start
pretty<00:03:50.739> much<00:03:50.860> somewhere<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.880> middle<00:03:52.209> here

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
pretty much somewhere in the middle here

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.710 
pretty much somewhere in the middle here
and<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.830> reason<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.090> dip<00:03:55.570> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and the reason is is that I just dip the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.350 
and the reason is is that I just dip the
brush<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> product<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.970> heaviest

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
brush so the product is the heaviest

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.300 
brush so the product is the heaviest
it's<00:03:58.570> gonna<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.170> don't<00:03:59.620> want<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.010> start<00:04:00.220> in

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
it's gonna be I don't want to start in

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.860 
it's gonna be I don't want to start in
the<00:04:00.370> inner<00:04:00.549> corner<00:04:01.090> because<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.360> would<00:04:01.690> mean

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
the inner corner because that would mean

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.150 
the inner corner because that would mean
that<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.110> would<00:04:02.440> end<00:04:02.590> up<00:04:02.680> putting<00:04:02.830> too<00:04:03.040> much

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
that I would end up putting too much

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.979 
that I would end up putting too much
product<00:04:03.459> there<00:04:03.790> as<00:04:04.000> well<00:04:04.570> as<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.840> outer

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
product there as well as the outer

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.110 
product there as well as the outer
corner<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:06.010> I'm<00:04:06.100> gonna<00:04:06.190> start<00:04:06.519> somewhat<00:04:07.030> in

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
corner so I'm gonna start somewhat in

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.940 
corner so I'm gonna start somewhat in
the<00:04:07.239> middle<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> eye<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.260> we're<00:04:08.830> gonna

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
the middle of the eye and we're gonna

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.820 
the middle of the eye and we're gonna
use<00:04:09.190> small<00:04:09.640> feather<00:04:10.060> strokes<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.720> as<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.739> can

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
use small feather strokes and as you can

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.710 
use small feather strokes and as you can
see<00:04:14.890> I've<00:04:15.250> started<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.820> middle<00:04:16.090> area<00:04:16.330> here

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
see I've started in the middle area here

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.080 
see I've started in the middle area here
if<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.080> very<00:04:17.290> very<00:04:17.380> strong<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.280> worked<00:04:18.910> my

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
if it's very very strong and worked my

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.230 
if it's very very strong and worked my
way<00:04:19.120> out<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.780> outer<00:04:19.930> corner<00:04:21.030> making<00:04:22.030> sure

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
way out to the outer corner making sure

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.130 
way out to the outer corner making sure
come<00:04:22.630> this<00:04:22.810> way

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
come this way

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.670 
come this way
making<00:04:23.470> sure<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.830> we<00:04:23.950> have<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> little<00:04:24.640> bit<00:04:24.970> of

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
making sure that we have a little bit of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.879 
making sure that we have a little bit of
an<00:04:26.680> angle<00:04:27.360> going<00:04:28.360> up<00:04:28.660> at<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:28.960> outer<00:04:29.200> corner

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.640 

now<00:04:34.789> that<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.060> have<00:04:35.300> less<00:04:35.629> product<00:04:36.199> on<00:04:36.349> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
now that I have less product on the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.659 
now that I have less product on the
brush<00:04:36.800> I'm<00:04:37.370> going<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.560> look<00:04:39.560> up<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:39.979> I'm<00:04:40.520> going

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
brush I'm going to look up and I'm going

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.570 
brush I'm going to look up and I'm going
to<00:04:40.729> come<00:04:40.939> back<00:04:40.969> into<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.509> inner<00:04:41.689> corner<00:04:42.580> going

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
to come back into the inner corner going

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.529 
to come back into the inner corner going
to<00:04:43.699> connect<00:04:45.400> this<00:04:46.400> wingtip<00:04:47.000> all<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.419> way

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
to connect this wingtip all the way

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.260 
to connect this wingtip all the way
through<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.139> that<00:04:48.169> we<00:04:48.409> have<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:49.639> continuity

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
through so that we have the continuity

00:04:50.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
through so that we have the continuity
that<00:04:50.750> we're<00:04:50.900> looking<00:04:51.050> for

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.710 

now<00:05:04.290> we're<00:05:04.470> going<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.940> create<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.180> top<00:05:06.389> part

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
now we're going to create the top part

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.480 
now we're going to create the top part
of<00:05:06.840> our<00:05:06.930> wing<00:05:07.139> tip<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:07.650> we're<00:05:07.830> utilizing<00:05:07.949> the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
of our wing tip and we're utilizing the

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.750 
of our wing tip and we're utilizing the
black<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:10.080> reason<00:05:10.530> we're<00:05:10.710> using<00:05:10.740> both<00:05:11.370> is

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
black the reason we're using both is

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.360 
black the reason we're using both is
because<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.270> gives<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.690> eyes<00:05:12.870> depth<00:05:13.470> if<00:05:13.770> you

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
because it gives the eyes depth if you

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.659 
because it gives the eyes depth if you
use<00:05:14.639> one<00:05:15.000> color<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.690> creates<00:05:16.590> more<00:05:16.770> almost<00:05:17.370> of

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
use one color it creates more almost of

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.850 
use one color it creates more almost of
a<00:05:17.760> flatness<00:05:18.389> doesn't<00:05:19.350> mean<00:05:19.500> that<00:05:19.680> it's<00:05:19.800> any

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
a flatness doesn't mean that it's any

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.650 
a flatness doesn't mean that it's any
less<00:05:20.160> pretty<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.760> just<00:05:21.000> means<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.300> can<00:05:21.389> be<00:05:21.479> more

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
less pretty it just means it can be more

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.170 
less pretty it just means it can be more
flat<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.199> we<00:05:22.320> are<00:05:22.440> combining<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.490> black<00:05:23.729> cream

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
flat so we are combining the black cream

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.230 
flat so we are combining the black cream
for<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.080> top<00:05:25.290> part<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.680> our<00:05:25.800> wing<00:05:25.949> tip<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:26.490> as

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
for the top part of our wing tip and as

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.300 
for the top part of our wing tip and as
we've<00:05:27.570> used<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.080> graphite<00:05:28.530> or<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.919> silver

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
we've used the graphite or the silver

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.420 
we've used the graphite or the silver
type<00:05:29.580> tone<00:05:29.850> for<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.240> bottom<00:05:30.889> so<00:05:31.889> essentially

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
type tone for the bottom so essentially

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.969 
type tone for the bottom so essentially
starting<00:05:32.940> with<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.690> most<00:05:33.840> tone<00:05:34.320> on<00:05:34.650> your

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
starting with the most tone on your

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:35.570 
starting with the most tone on your
brush

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
brush

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.520 
brush
you're<00:05:36.090> gonna<00:05:36.240> start<00:05:36.660> pretty<00:05:36.990> much<00:05:37.199> in<00:05:37.380> the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
you're gonna start pretty much in the

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.480 
you're gonna start pretty much in the
middle<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.070> eye<00:05:38.100> area<00:05:38.220> as<00:05:38.970> I'm<00:05:39.270> doing<00:05:39.570> here

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
middle of the eye area as I'm doing here

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.090 
middle of the eye area as I'm doing here
using<00:05:41.490> short<00:05:41.910> feather<00:05:42.270> strokes<00:05:42.800> now<00:05:43.800> that<00:05:44.070> I

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
using short feather strokes now that I

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.800 
using short feather strokes now that I
know<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.340> there's<00:05:44.669> less<00:05:45.030> product<00:05:45.630> on<00:05:45.780> my

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
know that there's less product on my

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.629 
know that there's less product on my
brush<00:05:45.960> I'm<00:05:46.500> going<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.710> come<00:05:46.919> around<00:05:47.070> and

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
brush I'm going to come around and

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.100 
brush I'm going to come around and
connect<00:05:48.410> that<00:05:49.410> wing<00:05:49.740> tip<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.160> the<00:05:50.550> bottom

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
connect that wing tip to the bottom

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.570 
connect that wing tip to the bottom
graphite<00:05:52.110> look<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.770> we<00:05:52.889> started<00:05:53.280> earlier

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
graphite look that we started earlier

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.390 
graphite look that we started earlier
now<00:05:54.449> that<00:05:54.690> there's<00:05:54.870> even<00:05:55.260> less<00:05:55.530> product<00:05:56.160> I'm

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
now that there's even less product I'm

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.010 
now that there's even less product I'm
going<00:05:56.669> to<00:05:56.760> come<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:57.300> I'm<00:05:57.389> going<00:05:57.539> to<00:05:57.600> grab<00:05:57.810> the

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
going to come and I'm going to grab the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:08.930 
going to come and I'm going to grab the
inner<00:05:58.229> corner<00:05:58.910> for<00:05:59.910> continuity

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940
