00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome all friends with you now he 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 and today's video will be again 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.599
 dedicated to French premium 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.540
 eighth level fcm 50 tons and so on this 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.030
 once a card Vat park ninth fight 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 level by itself fcm 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.750
 very rarely gets in such 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 serious fights for nines he falls but 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 there is usually one moving two nines in this 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.410
 Since there are 5 of them, the fight promises 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.059
 to be pretty so heavy and that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.700
 the most interesting patient is sort of like 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.219
 yes, but I already said in the previous video 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.890
 that he has no special armor and alpha 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.200
 it is small and so fight on 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 city ​​maps novations quite 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.539
 uncomfortable and all because his armor 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.989
 nope he can't drive around the corner there 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.600
 you tank some damage more so on 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 what I stopped there I talked about 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.440
 what sam 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
 there is no reservation and he can't leave 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 because of the corner there give some serious 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.869
 damage and roll back while not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 getting there breaking through some well in general 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.170
 without getting any damage 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 that's why on city maps 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.750
 the patient feels very much like that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.880
 not sure need some loopholes to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.150
 try to do it from afar 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 cause damage and on city maps this 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 quite problematic because 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.400
 there are a lot of buildings there and you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.750
 what is possible because of the catch far such well about 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.380
 long lumbago 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.479
 there are no plots practically here and in this 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.810
 I also did not know where to fight at first 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.670
 put it on 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.579
 stood on the center wanted to shoot 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.390
 can on this railway 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.759
 move 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.430
 I wanted to catch the Christmas tree but I also failed 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.409
 unfortunately and now I decide to change 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.860
 a little direction and here's help our 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.119
 kt 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.290
 who decided to zadefitsya see what 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.520
 crawling e75 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.710
 and in the bottom it can be easily pierced 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.170
 going down with him she is pretty 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.840
 good 212 understand as i said 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 Here and even E75 can punch 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.160
 caught up if you are lucky because in it the NLD 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 pretty unstable breaks and 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.000
 so I charge gold 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.940
 E75 by the way pretty aggressive 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.800
 decided to act went straight at us 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.680
 katy seen on i didn't break through 75 and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.730
 got him some kind of incomprehensible 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.990
 ricochet at all so even tank 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.910
 can we save all the same yes him here and 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.580
 still trying to conclude even 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.120
 he had time to ha returns foreign 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.810
 If here such affairs in general joint 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.470
 efforts we quickly disassemble it and 75 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.480
 I see that Patton will support him but 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.560
 patton had a different opinion and he stayed 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:03.420
 back and e75 bon got us surrendered 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.980
 I did not understand something here 54 probably decided 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.590
 play on the enemy and why did you kill it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.860
 of our forest I do not know that they are not there 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.260
 shared oh well fig they continue 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.110
 I go to control patton do not know 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.570
 where are you children again and notice that st-1 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.250
 rolled out on our side and there still 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.470
 flying 5450 foursome masterfully just 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.410
 stops before my shot and i 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750
 I'm naturally not getting here yet 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.620
 one damage without a home you something i aim 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.110
 I started but then I flew more or less 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.590
 ok trying targeting trying 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.410
 to aim the dog once more 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.930
 set fire and invest well here joint 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.340
 By the efforts of this grief we racher quickly 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.170
 very we finish st-1 already had time ago 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.930
 roll back new again I dump 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.290
 control and where is he looking a shot 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.860
 and you can go and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.989
 try to inflict damage on the tower 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.260
 strange as he did not make it and here 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.019
 sticking a piece out a little piece and 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.909
 again we do not fall into fact 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.670
 notation look for such moments when 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.729
 the enemy has turned away and is not looking at you 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.690
 and then I can already keep on it 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.220
 It's trying to do something like damage at all. 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.919
 in principle, on any tank so necessary 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.590
 do but here's the chain as I said 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.870
 due to lack of defense janis is small 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.740
 alpha nor as normal on it 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.169
 don't fight the city so you need to 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.139
 more attention to what moment 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.090
 when the enemy is not looking at you 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.750
 leave it put it in the meantime 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.780
 the score is not in our favor 78 our 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.560
 we seem to have left 79 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.530
 we have two tops left out of 84 4 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.220
 well the whole of 8 is not fully understood 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.030
 on ce 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.000
 and the enemies have one sweat stops but there is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.240
 one more drummers just for 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.830
 drummers him safely by 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.270
 we take away the arts together 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:18.870
 played and here I decide to help 54 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.270
 realizing realizing that this mate and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.159
 max 445 is almost the same as me 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.889
 will shoot me damage but 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:28.800
 I need to quickly help quickly 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:32.130
 foursome pick from a 6 because 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.440
 Take care of our stamp is my can say 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.050
 direct duty but received of course 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.820
 a lot of excess damage could i not 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.159
 take a risk but for some reason that's it 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.090
 The moment I decided that our 50 fours should be 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:47.580
 anyway help and i think it was 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.010
 correct more correct my actions 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.860
 because if I had not left and not 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.259
 fencing yourself in this mx 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.000
 in total he would have shot at 54 not a fact 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.340
 of course to get her punched 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.380
 but still there is a board somewhere he 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.810
 could he easily do damage and then 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.590
 he was already at 900 there much 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.930
 less well my actions helped 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.330
 due to my hp save our hp 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.920
 top and 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.460
 I think it was still not in vain 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.590
 paton distracts our comrades i'm trying 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.630
 it is here to aim but unfortunately not 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.230
 I manage to do it there for 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:29.070
 these hiding behind the bridge and in the meantime 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:32.930
 the score is already 11 9 our favor knives same 12:09 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.180
 by some miracle, ours of 8 out there coped with 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.200
 opponents are no longer in battle 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:43.530
 there remains a tiger and i end 4 and you can 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.160
 now here's the ending of the fight try 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.560
 shoot 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.140
 extra damage some noteworthy that 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.150
 all this time here's an enemy dealer standing 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.960
 and defile your base 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.350
 I helped my allies well for that 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.180
 we are his last 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.610
 punish and punish such 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.300
 dynamic battle enough turned out in 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.800
 why him so quite liked 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.790
 vigorous tank rubilovo can be said 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.940
 there was no standing and vigorous 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.680
 for that here I like Tanchiki fcm is for 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.120
 that he has a dynamic even in spite 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:23.090
 the lack of armor dynamics just him 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.290
 gorgeous 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.440
 in general he is cool 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.360
 buy pcm that's what i wanted to say well 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.580
 okay guys all this is of course yours 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.880
 personal business to buy straight tank no well 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:38.160
 that's me so this is the only tank 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.730
 about which you can enjoy from 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.770
 premium 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.870
 but this is of course all my personal opinion and 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.510
 naturally it's your business to listen 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:48.150
 my opinion is there no general here's such 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.460
 the battle turned out and now as always 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.920
 traditions will show you the outcome of this battle not 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.960
 so the results of the battle you can see on 

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.180
 your screens on i thank you for 

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.350
