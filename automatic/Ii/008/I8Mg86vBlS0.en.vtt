down<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.230> again<00:00:49.800> passed<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.489> through<00:00:51.320> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
down here again passed right through you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
down here again passed right through you
can<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.680> we've<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.070> bullet<00:00:53.340> hole<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
can see we've got a bullet hole here and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
can see we've got a bullet hole here and
then<00:00:54.930> exit<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.289> hole<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.739> entry<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.340> exit

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
then exit the hole here entry and exit

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.560 
then exit the hole here entry and exit

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and there's nothing inside that so it's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560 
and there's nothing inside that so it's
gone<00:01:00.719> straight<00:01:01.079> through<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:02.570> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gone straight through that as well and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.020 
gone straight through that as well and
then<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.229> fourth<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.970> which<00:01:05.970> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
