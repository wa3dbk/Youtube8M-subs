00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.999 
morning we think the sky will clear a
pretty<00:01:45.060> reasonable<00:01:45.299> chance<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.320> clear

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
pretty reasonable chance will be clear

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.520 
pretty reasonable chance will be clear
by<00:01:47.189> six<00:01:47.609> seven<00:01:47.850> o'clock<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.329> morning<00:01:48.719> but

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
by six seven o'clock in the morning but

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
by six seven o'clock in the morning but
it's<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> slow<00:01:50.219> process<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.789> look

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's going to be a slow process and look

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's going to be a slow process and look
at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> numbers<00:01:51.719> I<00:01:51.960> mean<00:01:52.170> keep<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.100> mind<00:01:53.130> here

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
at the numbers I mean keep in mind here

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.160

like we're not going to make it out of
the<00:05:03.500> 30s<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:05.720> just<00:05:06.020> for<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.290> fun<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.650> it

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
the 30s and just for the fun of it

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.830 
the 30s and just for the fun of it
here's<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.460> look<00:05:07.610> at<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.880> projected<00:05:08.480> snow

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
here's a look at the projected snow

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.730 
here's a look at the projected snow
cover<00:05:09.170> this<00:05:09.680> is<00:05:09.890> Thursday<00:05:10.630> night<00:05:11.630> there's<00:05:12.530> the

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
cover this is Thursday night there's the

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.940 
cover this is Thursday night there's the
evening<00:05:13.130> at<00:05:13.280> seven<00:05:13.850> o'clock<00:05:13.940> local<00:05:14.300> time<00:05:14.480> and

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
evening at seven o'clock local time and

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.620 
evening at seven o'clock local time and
this<00:05:15.950> is<00:05:16.100> suggesting<00:05:16.610> maybe<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:16.880> dusting<00:05:17.210> over

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
this is suggesting maybe a dusting over

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.840 
this is suggesting maybe a dusting over
Tennessee<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.320> maybe<00:05:18.650> near<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.400> Tennessee

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
Tennessee and maybe near the Tennessee

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.090 
Tennessee and maybe near the Tennessee
Alabama<00:05:20.030> border<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:20.930> we<00:05:21.020> think<00:05:21.170> any<00:05:21.350> snow<00:05:21.710> of

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
Alabama border but we think any snow of

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.650 
Alabama border but we think any snow of
significance<00:05:22.940> with<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.180> features<00:05:23.540> should

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
significance with that features should

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.020 
significance with that features should
stay<00:05:23.900> north<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.320> us<00:05:24.380> but<00:05:25.340> about<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.550> weekend

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
stay north of us but about the weekend

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.490 
stay north of us but about the weekend
you<00:05:26.120> ask<00:05:26.300> this<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.690> Saturday<00:05:27.140> should<00:05:27.350> be<00:05:27.470> a

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
you ask this is Saturday should be a

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.560 
you ask this is Saturday should be a
nice<00:05:27.740> day<00:05:28.040> we'll<00:05:28.370> start<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.700> day<00:05:28.850> around<00:05:29.120> 20

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
nice day we'll start the day around 20

let's<00:05:40.940> take<00:05:41.060> a<00:05:41.120> look<00:05:41.240> at<00:05:41.510> next<00:05:42.170> week<00:05:42.320> this<00:05:42.560> is

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
let's take a look at next week this is

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.920 
let's take a look at next week this is
Monday<00:05:43.310> a<00:05:43.340> big<00:05:43.670> old<00:05:44.740> 1053<00:05:45.740> millibar<00:05:46.400> high

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
Monday a big old 1053 millibar high

very cold air down the pike the GFS is

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.210 
very cold air down the pike the GFS is
clearly<00:05:53.360> suggesting<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.200> now<00:05:54.830> this<00:05:54.980> is

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
clearly suggesting that now this is

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.450 
clearly suggesting that now this is
Tuesday<00:05:56.060> of<00:05:56.180> next<00:05:56.210> week<00:05:56.510> January<00:05:57.140> seventh<00:05:57.590> it

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
Tuesday of next week January seventh it

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.340 
Tuesday of next week January seventh it
does<00:05:58.760> not<00:05:59.120> have<00:05:59.660> a<00:05:59.930> super<00:06:00.770> polar<00:06:01.190> vortex<00:06:02.350> far

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.900 
does not have a super polar vortex far
south<00:06:03.650> like<00:06:03.890> the<00:06:03.920> European<00:06:04.430> you're<00:06:04.550> about<00:06:04.730> to

see<00:06:05.120> but<00:06:05.330> still<00:06:05.570> that<00:06:05.780> would<00:06:05.900> suggest<00:06:06.080> in

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
see but still that would suggest in

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.430 
see but still that would suggest in
pretty<00:06:06.590> cold<00:06:06.860> air<00:06:07.070> for<00:06:07.310> Tuesday<00:06:07.670> of<00:06:07.820> next<00:06:07.850> week

don't buy to this thing full-scale at
this<00:07:18.860> point<00:07:19.130> but<00:07:19.280> that<00:07:19.430> is<00:07:19.550> a<00:07:19.580> very

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
this point but that is a very

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.140 
this point but that is a very

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150 
interesting run go out there later in

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.880 
interesting run go out there later in
the<00:07:23.240> month<00:07:23.330> back<00:07:23.570> to<00:07:23.690> the<00:07:23.780> GFS<00:07:24.380> this<00:07:24.620> is<00:07:24.770> the

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
the month back to the GFS this is the

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.470 
the month back to the GFS this is the
14th<00:07:25.400> out<00:07:25.610> there<00:07:25.790> at<00:07:25.880> mid<00:07:26.060> month<00:07:26.210> this<00:07:26.420> is

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
14th out there at mid month this is

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.510 
14th out there at mid month this is
suggesting<00:07:26.810> a<00:07:27.230> nice<00:07:27.410> surface<00:07:27.710> low<00:07:28.070> passing

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
suggesting a nice surface low passing

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.920 
suggesting a nice surface low passing
over<00:07:28.700> South<00:07:28.910> Alabama<00:07:29.420> and<00:07:29.600> that<00:07:29.690> would<00:07:29.810> be<00:07:29.840> a

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930 
over South Alabama and that would be a

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.480 
over South Alabama and that would be a
rain<00:07:30.200> event<00:07:30.380> if<00:07:30.620> this<00:07:30.740> is<00:07:30.890> right<00:07:31.040> in<00:07:31.190> the<00:07:31.250> next

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
rain event if this is right in the next

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.360 
rain event if this is right in the next
day<00:07:31.610> on<00:07:31.730> the<00:07:31.820> fifteenth<00:07:32.290> we<00:07:33.290> got<00:07:33.530> troughing<00:07:34.130> to

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.370 
day on the fifteenth we got troughing to

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.040 
day on the fifteenth we got troughing to
the<00:07:34.490> north<00:07:34.700> net<00:07:34.910> system<00:07:35.120> lifts<00:07:35.570> out<00:07:35.720> we<00:07:35.870> turn

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.050 
the north net system lifts out we turn

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.590 
the north net system lifts out we turn
colder<00:07:36.290> so<00:07:36.760> clearly<00:07:37.760> the<00:07:37.970> most<00:07:38.090> interesting

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
colder so clearly the most interesting

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.540 
colder so clearly the most interesting
element<00:07:38.960> to<00:07:39.050> this<00:07:39.169> is<00:07:39.380> next<00:07:39.710> week<00:07:39.919> how<00:07:40.160> cold
