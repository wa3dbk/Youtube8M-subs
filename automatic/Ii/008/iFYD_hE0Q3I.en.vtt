00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.300

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.930
 that they knew 10 years ago and 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.960
 right now for the moment we start 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.900
 take out the cue to the shepherd the huaraches 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.400
 the little things that barely have 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.889
