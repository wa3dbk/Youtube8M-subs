00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.269
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.459
 new video of grand theft auto 'online 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.350
 the one that I'm going to teach you in a career 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.439
 that I've done recently although in 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.599
 I really thought to make this video as 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.790
 content creator tutorial I 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.850
 seen that it would feel easy I think that 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.430
 it's worth making a video fully 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.980
 dedicated to it but it's still if 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.960
 Any one has any doubt whatsoever 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 paragraph that does not understand or does not know how 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 Doing such a thing asks me in the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.170
 comments and I assure you that I am going to 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.030
 answer good you know that I take 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.700
 very seriously the subscribers and I reply 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 all comments because those are not going to 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.530
 be less I will not answer you and with the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 maximum luxury of details and the career that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 I wanted to show is several jumps one 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.579
 that I created a couple of days ago and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 just when the creator came out he has gone 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.149
 improving until good now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.690
 it's pretty good we played 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.309
 many games of 16 people 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.289
 although sometimes it's short because I eat 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.479
 not be people that's a failure I 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.220
 I have to correct and shortened to 14 or 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.110
 12 people and it's a race that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.810
 is developed by the rich neighborhood by 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 those 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.440
 tilted those curves that we both 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.330
 like to travel at great speed and 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.370
 develops there and there are some 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.530
 jumps but the hardest part of this race 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.140
 it's not that but there is a stretch that is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.820
 also in the opposite direction is to say 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.530
 that you do it first in one direction 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.910
 but then there is a roundabout whereby 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.130
 you have to turn around and come back 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.020
 there with the danger that probably 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.600
 the second of the third of the race if 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 you go first keep coming out there and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.710
 you find it in front and you can 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.360
 playing with him imagines that you imagine of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.000
 16 people how can that be? 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.490
 practically, you always collide with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 3 or 4 on that in that stretch the truth that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.570
 although at the beginning it can be stressful 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.150
 then it becomes super fun 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.160
 I assure you so I encourage you to 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.440
 try it but not only was that the reason 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.260
 of this video but also ask you to 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.030
 you command your own missions or 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.100
 your own careers have been sent 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.290
 some that have been beautiful and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.080
 I want to make videos like that with the best 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.420
 of the week or if one surprises me 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.980
 very much make a video teaching the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.530
 saying what has appeared thus a 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 gameplay the type started and such if it is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 a very good career I would do well 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.150
 that I ask you please that you will have 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.160
 all you think I 'll play 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.349
 obviously without and now for whatever 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.650
 I do not think I want the case but if I 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.850
 start 100 races because I will not be able to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.450
 like is logic 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.430
 try them all but good I'll do in my 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 maximum effort and I will try to prove all 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.380
 and we can play them at events and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.750
 share them and others and I encourage you to 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.640
 send us because the truth the creator 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.470
 of content is super good and I'm 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.299
 Wishing to try our creations 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.830
 tell you that you can send me where 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.739
