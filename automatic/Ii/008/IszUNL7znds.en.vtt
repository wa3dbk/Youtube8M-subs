cartridges you will need to remove all
of<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.559> recommend<00:00:47.010> cleaning<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
of them as we recommend cleaning all of

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
of them as we recommend cleaning all of
the<00:00:47.910> printheads<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> same<00:00:48.930> time<00:00:49.260> often<00:00:49.770> if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the printheads at the same time often if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.950 
the printheads at the same time often if
there<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> problem<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.600> others

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there is a problem with one the others

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
there is a problem with one the others
may<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.530> similar<00:00:52.860> state<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.550> worth

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
may be in a similar state so it's worth

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
may be in a similar state so it's worth
doing<00:00:53.940> them<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> same<00:00:54.780> time<00:00:55.250> we

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
doing them all at the same time we

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.619 
doing them all at the same time we
recommend<00:00:56.579> wrapping<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.270> ink<00:00:57.449> cartridges

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
recommend wrapping your ink cartridges

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
recommend wrapping your ink cartridges
in<00:00:58.020> cling<00:00:58.230> film<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.559> stop<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:59.010> drying<00:00:59.280> out

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
in cling film to stop them drying out

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
in cling film to stop them drying out
during<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> cleaning<00:01:00.270> process<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:01.350> can

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
during the cleaning process they can

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.049 
during the cleaning process they can
stay<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.070> quite<00:01:02.370> happily<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> long
