00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to your districts welcome 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.440
 to minecraft second edition 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.750
 headings of the world and this time we came across 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
 map called ipad and the essence of this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.299
 cards in general pass all the tests 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 which are given on this card that is 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.820
 translated word and pout drains game though 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.680
 I don't know for sure, but I remember what we have 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.080
 there was a show called cruel 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.930
 games and there in general all tests were 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.449
 similar to these which we are here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.280
 appeared here in this little place 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.780
 there is a beginning 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.239
 the test goes here we have a sign with 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 the inscription is parting 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 here we do not know what it is and this too 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.320
 I do not know what is this record clear 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 here and here we have a chest in a gold chest 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.870
 apples reinforced seems let's take 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.480
 Here are so many signs and this is to pour 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.120
 for records let's take u 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.650
 counted and armor 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.580
 which is 44 underwater breathing 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.560
 3 helmet diamond is very cool let's 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.100
 we sit on the gold bullseye since he 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.610
 us already 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.520
 and no it's just a golden pen but nothing 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 we do not despair and let's begin 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.189
 finally so here we have a timer 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 you can also send your 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.280
 records find picture comments for 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.610
 video and we start hope we all have 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.619
 This I will go Nura so start push 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.619
 button that we see 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.960
 see we see what's in front of us 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.760
 the glass panel opened and we 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.380
 we go down the water we see a brick strip 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.720
 ical that we need to show that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.180
 go here we are going upstairs and here 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.310
 we do not see that we have red here 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 the path we are about to run 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.440
 and without hitting these red pad 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.300
 boxing who want to knock us out and 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.340
 water but it's pretty complicated but I 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.650
 I will try this way this way this way here 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.810
 such we passed on we see some 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.480
 cigarettes owned here not a cigarette it became 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.270
 to talk about the jump but we do it 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.160
 we can do this and we parkour master and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.750
 now we will do it with ease 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.960
 just like on the olympic games 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.600
 here we have some kind of house labyrinth exiled 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.319
 brando and how some bricks already 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.499
 imposed 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.310
 interfere with this house go away faster 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:33.280
 here we are jumping here we have ladders and 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.299
 prevents us through these maggots 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.719
 let's stone 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:42.219

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:45.790
 jumping it was of course epic it 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.780
