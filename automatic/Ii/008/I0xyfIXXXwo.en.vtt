 or others in free dance very 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 offensively of course remember because those 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
 ratings that were sent essentially saying 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 that the arbiter was willing to put them on 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.219
 Well, as Lena said she saw that Nikita 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.090
 led began to worry about him and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090
 lost control of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.890
 So Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katsalapov 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.800
 silver medalists 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.250
 Albinoni

 but 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.400
 at 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.220
 everyone wants very much 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.260

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.480
 when was last season 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.120
 then eat. And so imagine Lena 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.680
 19 gradual and the bride has flour 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.030

 ride and this number 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.320
 then we divide to that the most difficult support 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.560
 difficult transitions 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.360

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.190
 they will also be forced by the gain 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.730
