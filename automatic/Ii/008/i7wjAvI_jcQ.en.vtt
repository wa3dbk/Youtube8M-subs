a couple of them on the side because I

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.570 
a couple of them on the side because I

not<00:01:46.159> really<00:01:46.430> planning<00:01:46.640> on<00:01:46.909> doing<00:01:47.240> anything<00:01:47.570> so

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
not really planning on doing anything so

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.000 
not really planning on doing anything so
I'm<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:48.799> going<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:50.320> probably<00:01:51.320> run<00:01:51.860> my

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
I'm just going to probably run my

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.630 
I'm just going to probably run my
fingers<00:01:52.430> through<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.060> leave<00:01:54.610> them<00:01:55.610> to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
fingers through it and leave them to

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:11.540 
fingers through it and leave them to
fall<00:01:56.210> by<00:01:56.509> itself

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.220 

but<00:02:12.150> yeah<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> noticed<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:15.020> mean<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> don't

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
but yeah I noticed that I mean I don't

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.690 
but yeah I noticed that I mean I don't
really<00:02:16.470> Colm<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.370> lot<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:17.940> my<00:02:18.390> hair<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:22.700> not

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
really Colm it a lot but my hair is not

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.000 
really Colm it a lot but my hair is not
setting<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.600> much<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.800> as

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
setting as much as it was not as

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.400 
setting as much as it was not as
noticeable<00:02:29.310> because<00:02:30.180> typically<00:02:30.810> here<00:02:31.260> would

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
noticeable because typically here would

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.700 
noticeable because typically here would
be<00:02:31.440> all<00:02:31.770> over<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.310> place<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:33.050> son<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.440> like

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
be all over the place and son and I like

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.150 
be all over the place and son and I like
that<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:39.260> depending<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.560> results

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
that so depending on the results

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.210 
that so depending on the results
hopefully<00:02:41.430> nothing<00:02:42.420> has<00:02:43.050> happened<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.950> he

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
hopefully nothing has happened like he

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.580 
hopefully nothing has happened like he
damaged<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.940> will<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:46.380> doing<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.890> again<00:02:47.390> as<00:02:48.590> my

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
damaged I will be doing this again as my

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.950 
damaged I will be doing this again as my
protective<00:02:50.370> style<00:02:50.820> or<00:02:51.120> whatever<00:02:53.960> typically

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
protective style or whatever typically

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
protective style or whatever typically
my<00:02:55.230> left<00:02:55.560> side<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:56.520> resistant<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
my left side is more resistant so I

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.000 
my left side is more resistant so I
noticed<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.670> ends<00:03:00.210> were<00:03:00.450> kind<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:02.510> kind<00:03:03.510> of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
noticed that ends were kind of kind of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.910 
noticed that ends were kind of kind of
frizzing<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> bit<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.330> really<00:03:06.890> when<00:03:07.890> I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
frizzing out a bit and I really when I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.160 
frizzing out a bit and I really when I
took<00:03:08.070> out<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.790> took<00:03:09.300> down<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.690> rat<00:03:09.900> lab

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
took out the took down the rat lab

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.440 
took out the took down the rat lab
yesterday<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:11.100> actually<00:03:12.380> used<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:14.040> bit<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.090> heat

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
yesterday I actually used a bit of heat

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.610 
yesterday I actually used a bit of heat
on<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.820> sprayed<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.540> dog<00:03:18.959> heat<00:03:19.440> the
