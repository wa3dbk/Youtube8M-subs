more<00:01:57.250> power<00:01:59.400> and<00:02:00.400> once<00:02:00.640> again<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.170> power<00:02:02.410> in

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
more power and once again the power in

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.419 
more power and once again the power in
all<00:02:02.950> kicks<00:02:03.479> comes<00:02:04.479> from<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.490> when<00:02:06.700> we<00:02:06.820> use<00:02:07.090> the

called the front kick again in any

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.130 
called the front kick again in any
technique<00:02:22.330> though<00:02:22.510> as<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.780> can<00:02:22.959> notice

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
technique though as you can notice

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.010 
technique though as you can notice
there's<00:02:24.130> an<00:02:24.370> out<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.390> back<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
there's an out and there's a back and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.800 
there's an out and there's a back and
the<00:02:26.110> recoil<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.220> important<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.030> explosion

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the recoil is so important to explosion

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
the recoil is so important to explosion
in<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.080> technique<00:02:29.500> whether<00:02:30.160> it's<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.489> slower

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820
