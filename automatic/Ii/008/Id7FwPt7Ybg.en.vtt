00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
what if you instead rap game layers

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.200 
what if you instead rap game layers
around<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.350> real<00:00:43.500> life<00:00:43.940> everybody<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
around your real life everybody is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.729 
around your real life everybody is
passionate<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:45.899> something<00:00:46.230> whether<00:00:46.559> it's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
passionate about something whether it's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.400

good coffee or Radiohead or whatever and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
good coffee or Radiohead or whatever and
so<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.920> sense<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.149> scores

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so in that sense we don't have scores

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.970 
so in that sense we don't have scores
for<00:00:51.719> those<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> were<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> add<00:00:52.559> scores

for those what if you were to add scores

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 
for those what if you were to add scores
think<00:00:53.579> about<00:00:53.820> sort<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
