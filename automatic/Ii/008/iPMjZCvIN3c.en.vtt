00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.929 
position
so<00:01:25.540> I'm<00:01:25.689> pretty<00:01:26.530> much<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:27.100> way<00:01:27.220> I'd<00:01:27.399> be<00:01:27.610> if<00:01:27.790> I

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
so I'm pretty much the way I'd be if I

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.359 
so I'm pretty much the way I'd be if I
was<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.360> sports<00:01:28.689> car<00:01:28.930> right<00:01:29.220> except<00:01:30.220> I've

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
was in a sports car right except I've

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.240 
was in a sports car right except I've
got<00:01:30.450> animals<00:01:31.450> when<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.289> get<00:01:32.470> going<00:01:32.710> fast<00:01:33.009> on

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
got animals when you get going fast on

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.940 
got animals when you get going fast on
this<00:01:33.460> we<00:01:33.939> all<00:01:34.090> tend<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.450> hunched<00:01:35.229> up<00:01:35.409> like<00:01:35.680> this

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
this we all tend to hunched up like this

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.800 
this we all tend to hunched up like this
and<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.399> sort<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.850> position<00:01:37.299> when

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
and this is sort of the position when

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.210 
and this is sort of the position when
you're<00:01:37.930> just<00:01:38.079> cruising<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.590> can<00:01:38.799> lean<00:01:38.950> back

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
you're just cruising you can lean back

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.730 
you're just cruising you can lean back
but<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.060> premise<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.810> bike<00:01:41.049> low<00:01:41.380> center

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
but the premise of this bike low center

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.499 
but the premise of this bike low center
of<00:01:41.770> gravity<00:01:41.939> lightweight<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:43.179> lot<00:01:43.390> of

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
of gravity lightweight a lot of

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.960 
of gravity lightweight a lot of
horsepower<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:44.080> says<00:01:44.259> about<00:01:44.500> 80<00:01:44.799> horse<00:01:45.130> so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
horsepower that says about 80 horse so

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.730 
horsepower that says about 80 horse so
even<00:01:46.270> though<00:01:46.329> it<00:01:46.450> looks<00:01:46.600> like<00:01:46.689> a<00:01:46.810> Honda<00:01:47.170> 650

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
even though it looks like a Honda 650

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.919 
even though it looks like a Honda 650
it's<00:01:47.920> only<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.520> bottom<00:01:49.179> end<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.539> top-end

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
it's only that bottom end the top-end

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.950 
it's only that bottom end the top-end
stands<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:51.250> end<00:01:51.429> result<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:52.090> me<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.509> if<00:01:52.780> I'm

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
stands the end result for me is if I'm

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.200 
stands the end result for me is if I'm

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.050 

this<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.530> only<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:02.040> these<00:03:02.220> isn't<00:03:02.879> blue

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
this is the only one of these isn't blue

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.830 
this is the only one of these isn't blue
and<00:03:03.239> white<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.769> just<00:03:05.129> raw<00:03:05.340> carbon<00:03:05.849> he

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and white this is just raw carbon he

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.360 
and white this is just raw carbon he
just<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> way<00:03:07.470> look<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.340> very

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
just like the way look this is a very

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.449 
just like the way look this is a very
high<00:03:11.760> planet<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.620> don't<00:03:13.680> remember<00:03:13.980> what

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
high planet and I don't remember what

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.220 
high planet and I don't remember what
the<00:03:14.640> purpose<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.360> make<00:03:15.599> it<00:03:15.750> breathe<00:03:15.959> that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the purpose of that make it breathe that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
the purpose of that make it breathe that
I'm<00:03:16.440> sure<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:17.160> think<00:03:17.790> that's<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.150> point<00:03:18.599> of<00:03:18.750> it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
I'm sure I think that's the point of it

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.190 
I'm sure I think that's the point of it
because<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.709> larger<00:03:20.519> area<00:03:21.120> yeah<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.019> not

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
because it larger area yeah this is not

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.860 
because it larger area yeah this is not
a<00:03:22.230> gas<00:03:22.530> tank<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> intake<00:03:23.819> plenum<00:03:23.970> okay

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
a gas tank this is a intake plenum okay

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.380 
a gas tank this is a intake plenum okay
this<00:03:25.379> so<00:03:25.530> these<00:03:25.799> bikes<00:03:26.099> are<00:03:26.250> injected<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.209> gas

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
this so these bikes are injected the gas

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.539 
this so these bikes are injected the gas
tanks<00:03:27.780> actually<00:03:28.170> down<00:03:28.349> here<00:03:28.379> right<00:03:29.160> low

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
tanks actually down here right low

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.490 
tanks actually down here right low
weight<00:03:29.790> putting<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.690> weight<00:03:30.840> as<00:03:31.079> close<00:03:31.319> to

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
weight putting the weight as close to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.410 
weight putting the weight as close to
the<00:03:31.620> bottom<00:03:36.140> but<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.290> top<00:03:37.560> end<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.069> Dan's

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
the bottom but the top end is Dan's

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.949 
the bottom but the top end is Dan's
ratio<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:41.629> this<00:03:42.629> we<00:03:42.810> call<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.200> B<00:03:43.349> Gator<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
ratio so this we call the B Gator and

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.449 
ratio so this we call the B Gator and
this<00:03:45.959> makes<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.799> hundred<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.310> fifty

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
this makes about a hundred and fifty

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.789 
this makes about a hundred and fifty
horsepower<00:03:48.049> I'm<00:03:49.049> pretty<00:03:49.379> sure<00:03:49.530> that's

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
horsepower I'm pretty sure that's

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.339 
horsepower I'm pretty sure that's
accurate<00:03:50.069> it's<00:03:51.060> about<00:03:51.269> two<00:03:51.599> liters<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.140> think

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
accurate it's about two liters I think

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.789 
accurate it's about two liters I think
just<00:03:52.530> over<00:03:52.799> two<00:03:52.980> liters<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.519> motor<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.930> this

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
just over two liters the motor is this

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.190 
just over two liters the motor is this
is<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:58.670> unbelievable<00:03:59.670> when<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.540> gas<00:04:00.930> this

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
is just unbelievable when you gas this

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
is just unbelievable when you gas this
thing<00:04:01.440> first<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.709> all<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.890> makes<00:04:02.040> no

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
thing first of all it makes no

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.559 
thing first of all it makes no
difference<00:04:02.250> what<00:04:02.670> gear<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.090> there<00:04:03.359> are<00:04:03.420> six

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
difference what gear you there are six

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.080 
difference what gear you there are six
speeds<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.829> doesn't<00:04:05.250> matter<00:04:05.400> it's<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:05.940> much

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
speeds it doesn't matter it's so much

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.210
