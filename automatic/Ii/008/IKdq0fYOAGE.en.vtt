00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.690
 hello let's make some paper balls 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.340
 of decoration and you can use a paper that 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.590
 you like me I will use some papers 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.400
 so bright decorations that I'm going to 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.680
 use for Christmas 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.320
 for example this one that has an effect 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.850
 glitter in green as for the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.000
 another side is white what I'm going to do 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.110
 is to cover it with a green paper if it 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.850
 I do with two equal as is type 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.029
 Cardboard will be too thick I'm not going 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.029
 to serve 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.140
 but it is necessary that for the two 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.630
 sides have color and are not white that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.280
 are a little uglier good 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.080
 so what I'm going to do are strips of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 a centimeter if I leave I'll mark you 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.030
 the points I'm going to join and I'm going to do the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.030
 lines 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 for both sides and what one 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.940
 Well now I cut down the line 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.230
 you can make good ones the size that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 you want now you are going to see how it is is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.590
 with these measures we could have done 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.470
 the lines in the other direction in the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.700
 long part of the folio good now what 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.950
 must be done in each of the strips 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.210
 it's a little hole not on the edge 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.070
 so that it does not break a little bit more 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.280
 in half a centimeter more in like this 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.049
 on both sides in the center of each strip 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.790
 and I'm going to give you a little trick when you have 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.409
 a die-cutter and you have to empty the 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.700
 what I do is save these bits 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.960
 that serve me as confetti for others 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.690
 crafts by sending them in a 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.150
 little pot are small circles and 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.070
 we have a good homemade confetti 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.600
 Now that we have our strips with 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 the hole 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.900
 let's notice this gentleman that is called butterfly 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.490
 but if someone does not say it in some 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.159
 video I always use them I never know how 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.250
 they're called are these little metal things that 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.490
 They look like thumbtacks but they open 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.120
 They have like two little things that you open 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.950
 and you can leave it tied 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.950
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.650
 I'm going in then I'll open the two 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.980
 little legs that you have to stay 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.690
 subject 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.500
 they have to be well placed a strip 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.360
 on top of the other in order 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.900
 Now I'm going to teach you better you see 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.970
 here I have my taco of plasters 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.400
 hooked on both sides so now 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.959
 you just have to open it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.730
 a bit complicated from the beginning but in 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.260
 accountants the first ones are already folding 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.750
 him or squeezing him taking it from both 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.939
 sides depending on the size use a 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.769
 method or another but it simply consists 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.180
 in opening each of the strips to 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.579
 form the ball 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 You see, I have it here, you are holding it 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.170
 and how, for example, it seems 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.239
 We can hang it on a tree 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.670
 I'm going to give you a rope 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.390
 to be able to hang it I will give two 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.950
 options 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.230
 first of all I'm using as 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.330
 you see a metallic cord a wool if 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.610
 you want a thread and tied it in the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.959
 butterflies on the top and on the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.560
 bottom part to make a circle and 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.240
 can hang it 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.040
 the tuna knot and it would already be 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.720
 this to hang like any other 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.220
 Christmas ornament and the other option is 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.870
 use a pipe cleaner in this case I 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.730
 I have one green also Christmas type 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.440
 that hooked there is also in the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.350
 butt and closures that way more 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.210
 easy is better you see 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.980
 and here I am going to give you an example of how 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.440
 do it with the other paper we will do some 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.600
 larger strips as is one more paper 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.520
 fine a folio type then hit two one 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.950
 against another and I do the same thing I'm going to mark 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.330
 the strips and you'll see that the length goes to 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.770
 stay and how big and we do it in 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.750
 this sense is for you to see a 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.230
 little sizes along the sun 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.940
 I make the little holes 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.940
 and tied them with the butterfly 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.280
 I have them together I do not open it to be 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.200
 thinner is more flimsy but it's worth 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.060
 decoration does not need to hang this 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.310
 placed on a table for example is 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.250
 a very decorative ball 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.750
 and a third option that I give you is if 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.790
 you have a wrapping paper that you like 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.470
 you want to do this is to line a cardboard 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.840
 in this case used as you see a 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.520
 cereal box is our liner for the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.310
 two sides and I prepare melamine and 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.930
 I would have some balls like these 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.120
 Well, I hope you liked it and 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.720
