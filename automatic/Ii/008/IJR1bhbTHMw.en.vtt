00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
what you want on your car it's all kind
of<00:00:54.690> standard<00:00:55.050> Springs<00:00:55.500> what's<00:00:56.460> different

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of standard Springs what's different

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.920 
of standard Springs what's different
here<00:00:56.789> though<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> buy

here though is that you have to buy

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
here though is that you have to buy
front<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.350> rear<00:00:58.469> sway<00:00:58.680> bars<00:00:58.920> separately

couldn't<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> last<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.370> maybe<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.850> just

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
couldn't the last one maybe it's just

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.430 
couldn't the last one maybe it's just
the<00:02:21.090> fact<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> can't<00:02:21.720> swap<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.200> into<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
the fact that you can't swap it into a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.190 
the fact that you can't swap it into a

upgrade for e class and it would

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.760 
upgrade for e class and it would

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
optimize it for that reason so there's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.440
