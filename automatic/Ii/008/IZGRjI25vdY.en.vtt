now<00:00:18.660> listen<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> aldol<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:20.460> valve<00:00:20.730> sounds

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.479 

hear<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.130> you're<00:00:32.250> looking

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
now so you lose compression start and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.310 
now so you lose compression start and
start<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> from<00:00:40.590> how<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> pull<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> head<00:00:41.879> off

compressor tool I already have this
dialed<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.510> clamp<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> which

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
dialed in so I can just clamp it which

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.819 
dialed in so I can just clamp it which
takes<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> muscle<00:00:57.320> put<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.620> here

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
up with the valve here so I'm looking

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.140 
up with the valve here so I'm looking
under<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.480> head<00:01:05.270> oops<00:01:09.409> a<00:01:11.000> little<00:01:12.000> bit<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
under the head oops a little bit of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.260 
under the head oops a little bit of
force<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.630> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> tough<00:01:13.020> okay<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.530> goes

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
the holds of Elven it's really don't
know<00:01:21.570> anything<00:01:22.020> too<00:01:22.290> complicated<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:23.030> it's

a lot easier than you know I thought it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.120 
a lot easier than you know I thought it
would<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:28.619> course<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:28.979> they

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
said that these rings with knees won't

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.649 
said that these rings with knees won't
come<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.689> clips<00:01:32.659> that<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.450> other

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
helped move this and this spring comes

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.890 
helped move this and this spring comes
revolt<00:02:03.850> now<00:02:04.850> all<00:02:05.030> I'm<00:02:05.150> doing<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.450> cleaning<00:02:05.750> up

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
so cleaned up the valve a little bit see

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.690 
so cleaned up the valve a little bit see
I<00:02:41.300> mean<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:41.750> not<00:02:41.870> perfect
