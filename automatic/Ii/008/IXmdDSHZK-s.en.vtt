00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
cheapest I could find one on amazon.com

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.910 
cheapest I could find one on amazon.com
and<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> believe<00:02:10.140> twenty<00:02:10.560> three

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and that was for I believe twenty three

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920 
and that was for I believe twenty three
dollars<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:11.819> may<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.300> had<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.720> for

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
dollars and they may have had so for

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.780 
dollars and they may have had so for
like<00:02:13.080> 18

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
like 18

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.660 
like 18
but<00:02:15.299> as<00:02:15.420> far<00:02:15.659> as<00:02:15.720> Walmart<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.920> Target<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.549> was

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
but as far as Walmart and Target it was

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.649 
but as far as Walmart and Target it was
30<00:02:17.970> bucks<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.590> works<00:02:19.980> well<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.450> is

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
30 bucks so it works well but it is

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.600 
30 bucks so it works well but it is
pretty<00:02:22.110> expensive<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.099> don't<00:02:23.280> know<00:02:23.430> how

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
pretty expensive like I don't know how

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.630 
pretty expensive like I don't know how
much<00:02:23.900> face<00:02:24.900> moisturizer<00:02:25.470> should<00:02:26.010> cost<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.610> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
much face moisturizer should cost but I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
much face moisturizer should cost but I
feel<00:02:26.909> like<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.209> was<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.360> big<00:02:27.540> parenthesis

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
feel like that was a big parenthesis

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.160 
feel like that was a big parenthesis
though<00:02:28.439> I<00:02:29.209> don't<00:02:30.209> all<00:02:30.329> see<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.750> these<00:02:30.900> eight

though I don't all see up to these eight

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.860 
though I don't all see up to these eight
