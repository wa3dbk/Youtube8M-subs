00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.049
 yo everybody knows genetics we get 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 found for a new video 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.480
 certainly an extremely video 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.450
 unknown and a video really 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.379
 exceptional so you notice it 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.980
 certainly you have the big map 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.570
 theft auto 5 special editions so of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
 this pack which I made the boxing man 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 so today as you have seen 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 in the title but you may not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.000
 not having understood correctly I will 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.579
 show a video or rockstar has hidden 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.520
 things on the map is really 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.590
 this map of the special edition and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.899
 collector so normal editions do not 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.540
 do not have it really this card 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 there the blue and of course this one of 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.110
 cards there are secrets on it so I 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.800
 not talk about what is written about what 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.899
 is written in red 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 I'm talking about other doses excuse me 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 other things so you saw in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 the ultraviolet ultra violet title is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.109
 it's an ultraviolet lamp 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.439
 so I'm going to show you something 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 we will turn off the lights also see 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.700
 and look well I take the lan 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.950
 can translate them and there I will go 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.890
 on the map 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.790
 so let's go I'll play tomorrow can 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.500
 no you see you're not going to see you 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.340
 take a little map 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 and here are things 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.619
 appear to the ultra violet so I 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.090
 can show the ball a bit then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.619
 I try 2 or less in that it's enough 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.880
 complicated you see that there are things 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.540
 which only appear in the ultra violet 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.689
 which this circle out there top then does it have 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.460
 not fine tuning but that and he 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.840
 there is something else 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.509
 the airport that is there call 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.970
 it's really hard to use and 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.320
 see that there is 1,500 turn here it is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.149
 is a round that is that the ultra 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.870
 purple i want to show watch i'm going 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.940
 light up 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.680
 the lights we still see a little but 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.900
 look at what is taking away the ultraviolet 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.440
 it's not mytho we see nothing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.420
 so it's really great finally it's a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.290
 really rockstar thing they did very 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 very hard for you to find that so he 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.010
 there are really not many people 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.450
 who know it and they poppy and those who 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.020
 do not know necessarily lamps 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.850
 ultraviolet 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.690
 so that's why I'm going 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.180
 show you myself in the video the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.100
 places so we go to this place so 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.090
 I'll go back a little faster 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.550
 so let's go we'll do a shot 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.750
 so this place is where there is 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.400
 written time 1996 lazare Sardinian goal 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.260
 so that's what is written so it's 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.760
 in the military base so he will you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.100
 indicates with the help of an arrow that it is 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.570
 in the middle of the base you have the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.370
 harrier attac so it's the buzzard 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.110
 attac 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 after you have lots of little dots 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.280
 so that's really complicated 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.220
 do that and you have a point that is 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.270
 just there i do not know i do not know 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.760
 still what's one of those points there 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.700
 you still have here little ones 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.760
 points that lights up we still have one 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.800
 in the middle we still have some here 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.920
 which are indicated by arrows 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.209
 so just give up the secrets of the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.400
 we still have there excuse me what 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.590
 you start to see more and reach 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 up there so it's a neglected the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.500
 second most important I 'm trying to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.230
 show you and so this one was 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.540
 writing then it's nothing written at all 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.090
 but there is a circle so the after 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.970
 Here is one thing that enjoy Franco 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.860
 case franck meyer put the cases 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.850
 take the boxes so it's 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.560
 places finally it's really there 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.250
 many things that are written of which 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.770
 the treasures 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.340
 so if I die if I do not sulk them 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.110
 treasures they are written on 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.780
 in short, it's really amazing 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.040
 rockstar and put that up two sides 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.110
 this is the end of this video so 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.940
 I hope she will have pleased you so she 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.990
 pass this video goes into vip so I 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.160
 will you explain what these stuffs 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.350
 tips on gta 5 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.730
 it's just videos of 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.940

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.930

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.030
 to have money cars 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.860
 easy on two things that I confess 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.690
 m full of things to know they are 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.520
 really to know about gta and that all the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.980

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.690
 what my series serves it so for 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.430
 first episode I find that it is 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.350
 really exceptional so do not hesitate 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.910
 not really a good 1 inch bar 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.340
 green it's really amazing 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.900
