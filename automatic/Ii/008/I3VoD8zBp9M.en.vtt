slip<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.219> cut<00:00:32.340> them<00:00:32.520> all<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> sides<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.180> them

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
slip and cut them all the sides of them

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.150 
slip and cut them all the sides of them
they<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.110> have<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> tendency<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.739> round<00:00:34.980> out

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

going to have another thirty two on the
top<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
top and what you're going to do is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.730 
top and what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> hold<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> bottom<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.350> as

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you're going to hold the bottom one as

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
you're going to hold the bottom one as
much<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.220> doing<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.520> hub<00:01:17.640> adjustment<00:01:18.119> hold

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
much like doing a hub adjustment hold

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.820 
much like doing a hub adjustment hold
the<00:01:18.810> bottom<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.350> place<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.770> then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the bottom one into place and then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
the bottom one into place and then
thread<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> top<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.259> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
thread the top one down a little bit and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
thread the top one down a little bit and
I<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.220> leg<00:01:23.430> against<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> side<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
I have my leg against the side of the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.130 
I have my leg against the side of the
wheel<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> wheel<00:01:24.960> doesn't

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
wheel here so that the wheel doesn't

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.450 
wheel here so that the wheel doesn't
move<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.500> me<00:01:25.619> while<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:25.890> trying<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
move on me while I'm trying to do it and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.410 
move on me while I'm trying to do it and
you're<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> bring<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.360> two

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you're just going to bring these two

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.670 
you're just going to bring these two
wrenches<00:01:27.750> together<00:01:28.170> till<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
wrenches together till you get to the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
wrenches together till you get to the
point<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.100> you're<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.939> proper

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
point where you're you have a proper

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.850 
point where you're you have a proper
adjustment<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.049> right<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
adjustment so right now it's just a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.020 
adjustment so right now it's just a
little<00:01:31.979> bit<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> tight<00:01:32.490> side<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.909> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
little bit on the tight side so what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.890 
little bit on the tight side so what
we're<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> we're<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> take

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
we're going to do is we're going to take
and<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.710> off<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and just back this one off again just a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
and just back this one off again just a
little<00:01:35.579> bit<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:38.450> double-check<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> again<00:01:39.780> see

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
little bit and double-check it again see

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:40.700 
little bit and double-check it again see
how<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.380> rolls

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
how it rolls

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.499 
how it rolls
still<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.340> bit<00:01:41.460> too<00:01:41.549> tight<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
still a little bit too tight this is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.999 
still a little bit too tight this is
normally<00:01:42.960> how<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.140> goes<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
normally how it goes so you're going to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
normally how it goes so you're going to
want<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.460> off<00:01:44.549> again<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> little

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
want to back it off again just a little

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.789 
want to back it off again just a little
bit<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.229> we're<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.409> looking<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
bit and we're just looking for that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.990 
bit and we're just looking for that
adjustment<00:01:47.250> where<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.430> rolls<00:01:47.610> nice<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
adjustment where it rolls nice and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.399 
adjustment where it rolls nice and
smooth<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.450> after<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
smooth like that after you have

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.600 
smooth like that after you have
everything<00:01:49.500> adjusted<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> want<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> double

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
everything adjusted you want to double

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100 
everything adjusted you want to double
check<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> make<00:01:51.060> sure<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:52.020> have

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
check and make sure that you have

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.300 
check and make sure that you have
everything<00:01:52.409> nice<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.619> tight<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.100> top

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
everything nice and tight on the top

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
everything nice and tight on the top
this<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.030> chronically<00:01:54.509> come<00:01:54.689> loose

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this one will chronically come loose

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
this one will chronically come loose
over<00:01:55.350> time<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> bring<00:01:56.670> those

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
over time so just want to bring those

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.100 
over time so just want to bring those
two<00:01:56.939> wrenches<00:01:57.270> together<00:01:57.509> make<00:01:57.930> sure<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
two wrenches together make sure that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
two wrenches together make sure that
it's<00:01:58.259> nice<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.439> tight<00:01:58.619> feel<00:01:59.460> good<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.729> your

it's nice and tight feel good about your

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.160 
it's nice and tight feel good about your
adjustment<00:02:00.360> there<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.719> you're<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> go
