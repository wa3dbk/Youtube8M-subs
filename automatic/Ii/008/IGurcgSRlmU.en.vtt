way after I replace the battery we put a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
way after I replace the battery we put a
tester<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.270> positive<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
tester up to the you know positive and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
negative and as I revved the bike it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
negative and as I revved the bike it
actually<00:00:54.750> lost<00:00:55.079> power<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> battery

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
actually lost power from the battery

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.110 
actually lost power from the battery
rather<00:00:56.730> than<00:00:57.000> gaining<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.969> after<00:00:59.969> having

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
rather than gaining it and after having

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
rather than gaining it and after having
the<00:01:00.300> battery<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.170> hour<00:01:01.460> hour

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
