we want to do next is you know same for
the<00:02:44.579> other<00:02:44.700> leg<00:02:45.230> pull<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.560> pin<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:46.859> then

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the other leg pull out the pin and then

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.330 
the other leg pull out the pin and then
the<00:02:47.970> legs<00:02:48.180> will<00:02:48.389> slide<00:02:48.629> down<00:02:48.859> just<00:02:49.859> push<00:02:50.099> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the legs will slide down just push the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.849 
the legs will slide down just push the
pins<00:02:50.700> back<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.870> technique<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.500> used<00:02:52.680> by

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
pins back in this technique is used by

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.759 
pins back in this technique is used by
boys<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.310> most<00:02:53.549> toys<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.530> then<00:02:55.530> what<00:02:55.680> you

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
boys with most toys and then what you

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.750 
boys with most toys and then what you
want<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.010> do<00:02:56.159> next<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.669> um<00:02:57.919> fold<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.069> arms<00:02:59.489> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
want to do next is um fold the arms a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.159 
want to do next is um fold the arms a
little<00:03:00.090> bit<00:03:00.329> like<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
little bit like so

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.440 
little bit like so
and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.799> turn<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.099> head<00:03:02.250> 180<00:03:02.849> degrees

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and then just turn the head 180 degrees

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.920 
and then just turn the head 180 degrees
and<00:03:03.750> push<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.079> down<00:03:04.109> oh<00:03:06.439> by<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.469> way<00:03:08.689> this<00:03:09.689> head

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and push it down oh by the way this head

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.640 
and push it down oh by the way this head
design<00:03:10.319> for<00:03:10.650> Optimus<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.840> similar<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.439> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
design for Optimus is similar to the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.670 
design for Optimus is similar to the
boys<00:03:14.069> most<00:03:14.489> toys<00:03:14.730> deluxe<00:03:15.269> Optimus<00:03:15.840> head<00:03:16.049> but

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
boys most toys deluxe Optimus head but

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.589 
boys most toys deluxe Optimus head but
it's<00:03:16.829> not<00:03:17.040> quite<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.549> same<00:03:18.169> like<00:03:19.169> wow<00:03:19.739> maybe

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
it's not quite the same like wow maybe

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.399 
it's not quite the same like wow maybe
96%<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.930> my<00:03:22.409> design<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:24.409> 4

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
96% of it is my design and like 4

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.059 
96% of it is my design and like 4
percent<00:03:25.949> is<00:03:26.099> his<00:03:26.340> design<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.739> want<00:03:28.979> to

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
percent is his design so you want to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.949 
percent is his design so you want to
kind<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.340> align<00:03:29.669> it<00:03:29.879> perfectly<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.599> his<00:03:30.720> head

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
kind of align it perfectly so his head

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.009 
kind of align it perfectly so his head
your<00:03:31.229> saw<00:03:31.970> well<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> arms<00:03:33.650> um

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
your saw well so the arms um

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.159 
your saw well so the arms um
fold<00:03:37.019> in<00:03:37.169> perfectly<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.949> then<00:03:38.849> this<00:03:39.180> up<00:03:39.629> this

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
fold in perfectly and then this up this

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.119 
fold in perfectly and then this up this
I'll<00:03:40.349> flap<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.859> here<00:03:41.129> we<00:03:41.370> want<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.699> push<00:03:41.909> down

so<00:03:44.129> we<00:03:44.400> have<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.790> CAD<00:03:45.030> part<00:03:45.419> already<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:46.439> we

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
so we have the CAD part already what we

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.189 
so we have the CAD part already what we
want<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.859> do<00:03:46.949> is<00:03:47.159> push<00:03:47.549> this<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.569> forty
