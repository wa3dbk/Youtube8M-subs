00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 we are here in the interior of são paulo 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.519
 already with the first phase of construction of the completed half 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.089
 We're here with a car rolled up on the road. 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 and there was customization 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.409
 ready chassis already with air bags 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:25.769
 in suspension 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.949
 mechanical painted chassis 302 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 and automatic c4 exchange in place 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.040
 on here 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.910
 the banks 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.730
 the author my best 4 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.360
 I bought 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.200
 these banks in a free market without pretense of taboo 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.990
 surprisingly banks are silly 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.290
 the two electric front seats 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.950
 training and correct liana that sin now it goes away will not be black 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.420
 these banks or c 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.060
 altered the designs too folks will take the taxes out of head that 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.340
 do not match with 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.100
 with the time and design of the car 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.479
 we are going to have two individual aic front seats with consoli separating 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 the interior of the car extending until the bench brings 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.910
 the idea is to continue with this December 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.940
 the course of 2º 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 as if it were two individual seats behind 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.870
 the roof 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 considerably lower than the original 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.230
 we took some 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.230
 8 centimeters of height of the column 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.920
 practically a span 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.050
 little less 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.790
 from the window 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.070
 and give it a much more appearance than in much more 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 consistent with with the car proposal 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.450
 according to my friend the bags the macro and came with defective factory 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.580
 in relation to the designer and we fixed it under the roof of the car 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.440
 We've done something American is too lazy to do. 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.049
 but we also changed the height of the window to bring the 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.590
 finally they cut the ceiling down the ceiling 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.439
 like windshield and retain easier to make them they ask floor 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.309
 this setting that is here 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:32.029
 and the tetanus is cut in this area a span above the rear window 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.269
 I saw then they return the window at the same height as it was originally as 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.359
 I like very strange that we will have 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.659
 the four doors and the windshield at a height if the rear window 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.449
 from others 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:50.869
 In this case, we chose to change cars and 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.359
 the window bring idc together 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.669
 So 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.649
 after ready it will appear to be adaptation 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.449
 this idea is not 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.949
 quiquiqui and that the high people updated the design of the car 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.919
 more will keep the characteristics to iquique 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.989
 that confers the goal in one of the most beautiful cars of its time 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.639
 worshiped in what movie easy 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.829
 there is a lot of history behind it that kind of 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.209
 car 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.799
 In the funeral 1949 already already did this 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.669
 hehe since then to one of the most customized positions in the world there 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.369
 and that here in Brazil is wrong wherever you come we met in the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.019
 no bid medical bills have in brazil 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.019
 and with this level of customization has very little 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.059
 the car is going 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.059
 You'll stay here, we'll be at my mother's house. 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:50.790
 waiting to come 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.790
 the shipment of leprosy 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.309
 probably preteriu de são paulo where it will be completed and now the people 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.309
 enters the finish phase of the car 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.230
 this is it is work
