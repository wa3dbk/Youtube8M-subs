00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
they might have to reapply and if yours

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.700 
they might have to reapply and if yours
pivot<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.240> mine<00:02:51.510> do<00:02:51.750> you're<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> have

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710

pivot like mine do you're going to have
to<00:02:52.830> clean<00:02:53.130> out<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:54.270> sides<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:54.900> how<00:02:55.230> it

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
to clean out the sides you see how it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.170 
to clean out the sides you see how it
pivots<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.950> perm<00:02:58.950> got<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.310> there<00:02:59.520> as<00:02:59.670> well<00:02:59.940> you

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
pivots so perm got in there as well you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.750 
pivots so perm got in there as well you
definitely<00:03:00.420> want<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.960> clean<00:03:01.140> these<00:03:01.230> off

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.390 
probably going to put some like a rubber
band<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:21.180> hold<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.810> together<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.740> just<00:03:22.830> apply

on<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.360> outer<00:03:24.570> edges<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.140> I'll<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.380> right<00:03:25.500> back

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.630 

okay<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.320> put<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.800> rubber<00:03:31.980> band<00:03:32.280> here

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640

and I just put the palm on the outside

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.950 
and I just put the palm on the outside
edges<00:03:37.890> for<00:03:38.700> some<00:03:38.880> reason<00:03:39.270> these<00:03:39.480> are<00:03:39.540> being

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
edges for some reason these are being

00:03:39.960 --> 00:04:15.699 
edges for some reason these are being
very<00:03:40.380> stubborn

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.259 

but<00:04:16.709> there's<00:04:16.919> still<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.160> lot<00:04:17.519> better<00:04:17.790> than<00:04:18.150> they

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
but there's still a lot better than they

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.830 
but there's still a lot better than they
were<00:04:18.329> when<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.840> first<00:04:19.109> started<00:04:19.560> out<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
were when I first started out the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.379 
were when I first started out the
insides<00:04:25.380> are<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.860> much<00:04:26.070> better<00:04:26.389> it's

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
insides are so much better it's

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.360 
insides are so much better it's
ridiculous

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.879 

and<00:04:32.600> like<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.750> said<00:04:33.810> just<00:04:33.960> make<00:04:34.200> sure<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.680> get

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
and like I said just make sure you get

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:47.270 
and like I said just make sure you get
any<00:04:35.070> excess<00:04:35.610> time<00:04:35.940> in<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.600> pivot<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:47.100> can

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
any excess time in the pivot you can

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.909 
any excess time in the pivot you can
also<00:04:47.460> um<00:04:48.210> get<00:04:48.660> like<00:04:48.810> an<00:04:48.930> old<00:04:49.110> toothbrush<00:04:49.620> and

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
also um get like an old toothbrush and

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.219 
also um get like an old toothbrush and
that's<00:04:50.190> probably<00:04:50.400> what<00:04:50.610> I'll<00:04:50.729> do<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:54.139> or<00:04:55.139> if

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
that's probably what I'll do and or if

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.730 
that's probably what I'll do and or if
you<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.470> nails<00:04:55.710> it's<00:04:56.040> coming<00:04:56.310> off<00:04:56.460> with<00:04:57.090> that

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
you have nails it's coming off with that

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.610 
you have nails it's coming off with that
and<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.770> scrape<00:04:59.550> the<00:05:00.540> black<00:05:00.840> stuff<00:05:01.139> off<00:05:01.350> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
and just scrape the black stuff off the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.469 
and just scrape the black stuff off the
edges<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.400> edges<00:05:02.430> are<00:05:02.850> going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.060> be<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> little

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
edges the edges are going to be a little

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.990 
edges the edges are going to be a little
bit<00:05:03.660> more<00:05:03.960> difficult<00:05:04.500> because<00:05:04.790> they're<00:05:05.790> being

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
bit more difficult because they're being

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.260 
bit more difficult because they're being
used<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.479> lot<00:05:06.630> more<00:05:06.900> than<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.560> inside<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.880> that

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270
