00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.710
 the idea to be in top shape for the big appearance at the upcoming

 In 2003 she won silver in the giant slalom in Sankt Moritz 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.080
 Four years later, she was now also Airports

 at the last World Championships in Val d'isère he 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.580
 missed the podium for ca seconds 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.860
 World Champion is certainly one 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.110

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.440
 wide areas of the team all know some of me there actually have to go there 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.450
 There is a nice kind of power and summer already happening in the square 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
 the ability to track recent rankings that set new path go the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.060
 Wake-up ballot beyond her poems 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 Maybe that works out after all 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.090
 unlike the other athletes what has not been up this season yet 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.210
 commitment 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.680
 The knee pain had to be tedious 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.830
 like the experience of 126 World Cup races like they lag behind 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.760
 compensate 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.649
 The golden chain of leather actually fits in the shape 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.130
 therefore good 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.039
 but as it then in the race did not even begin by Fatmire Lira 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.689
 isolated practice is that without Rennella she has the wm-rivet I know 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.150
 I am very happy that the case Meinert was so must 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.310
 Citizens for what to intervene 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.500

 on a long-term experience also the Gadertal a manual likes 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.859
 To fall back on 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.859

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.729
 Achieve giant slalom 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.209
 At that time she made it to seventh place 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.040

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.239
 While this may have been one of the eleven starters in the project these are 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:23.730
