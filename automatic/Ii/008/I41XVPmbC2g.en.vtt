00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
compare it to the some other cars in

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.280 
compare it to the some other cars in
there<00:02:13.790> one<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.180> them<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.450> Mustang<00:02:14.900> which<00:02:15.080> is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
there one of them is a Mustang which is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.900 
there one of them is a Mustang which is
I<00:02:15.590> used<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.860> use<00:02:16.010> all<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.310> time<00:02:16.459> now<00:02:16.700> that's

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
I used to use all the time now that's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.180 
I used to use all the time now that's
slow<00:02:17.209> compared<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> these<00:02:17.900> other<00:02:18.049> two<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.620> but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
slow compared to these other two so but

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680 
slow compared to these other two so but
this<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.580> still<00:02:19.760> faster<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.540> see

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
this one is still faster as you can see

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.350 
this one is still faster as you can see
there<00:02:20.930> are<00:02:20.959> some<00:02:21.350> stats<00:02:21.680> there<00:02:21.980> i<00:02:22.880> will<00:02:23.239> get

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
there are some stats there i will get

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.420 
there are some stats there i will get
closer<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.810> don't<00:02:23.989> worry<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.340> see

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
closer to it don't worry as you can see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.309 
closer to it don't worry as you can see
there<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.940> top<00:02:26.150> speed<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.569> acceleration<00:02:26.840> are

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
there the top speed and acceleration are

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.440 
there the top speed and acceleration are
great<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.849> compare<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.330> this

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
great and you can compare it to this

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.120 
great and you can compare it to this
other<00:02:29.750> free<00:02:30.260> car<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.650> can<00:02:30.769> find<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
other free car that you can find on the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.400 
other free car that you can find on the
street<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.269> energy<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:33.290> bit

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
street but the energy is a little bit

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.880 
street but the energy is a little bit
faster<00:02:33.650> at<00:02:34.160> top<00:02:34.760> speed<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.299> acceleration

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
faster at top speed and acceleration

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.610 
faster at top speed and acceleration
especially<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.130> mati<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.120> um<00:02:38.540> yeah<00:02:39.349> guys
