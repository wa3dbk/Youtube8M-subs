00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
technologies where they cluster LEDs

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.070 
technologies where they cluster LEDs
together<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.730> reduce<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.420> cost<00:01:04.660> of<00:01:04.900> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
together and reduce the cost of the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.430 
together and reduce the cost of the
fixture<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:06.190> also<00:01:06.790> lumen<00:01:07.210> efficacy<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:07.960> the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
fixture and also lumen efficacy that the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.980 
fixture and also lumen efficacy that the
fixtures<00:01:08.920> are<00:01:09.100> realizing<00:01:09.820> today<00:01:10.150> we<00:01:10.450> put<00:01:10.780> in

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
fixtures are realizing today we put in

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.960 
fixtures are realizing today we put in
our<00:01:11.110> program<00:01:11.650> for<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.040> percent<00:01:12.430> efficiency

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
our program for the percent efficiency

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.780 
our program for the percent efficiency
and<00:01:13.450> now<00:01:13.660> we're<00:01:13.930> realizing<00:01:14.310> 63<00:01:15.310> percent

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
and now we're realizing 63 percent

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.630 
and now we're realizing 63 percent
obviously<00:01:16.479> what<00:01:16.780> we<00:01:16.990> save<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.770> what<00:01:18.040> pays<00:01:18.310> back

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
obviously what we save is what pays back

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.120 
obviously what we save is what pays back
the<00:01:18.910> loan<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.750> savings<00:01:20.350> will<00:01:20.680> pay<00:01:20.920> back

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
the loan so that savings will pay back

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
the loan so that savings will pay back
the<00:01:21.369> loan<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.580> little<00:01:21.940> bit<00:01:22.030> faster

burglary and theft by just looking at
those<00:01:50.530> numbers<00:01:50.590> we've<00:01:51.430> seen<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.730> major<00:01:52.120> ten<00:01:52.600> and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
those numbers we've seen a major ten and

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.110 
those numbers we've seen a major ten and
a<00:01:52.780> half<00:01:52.930> percent<00:01:53.290> reduction<00:01:54.250> in<00:01:54.370> crimes<00:01:54.700> now

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120

we<00:01:55.180> know<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.990> police<00:01:56.200> department<00:01:56.740> plays<00:01:56.890> a

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
we know the police department plays a

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.950 
we know the police department plays a
big<00:01:57.190> role<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.490> this<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.180> think<00:01:58.330> lighting

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
big role in this but I think lighting

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.150 
big role in this but I think lighting
plays<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.350> big<00:01:59.650> role<00:01:59.680> also<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:02.890> we<00:02:03.010> will

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
plays a big role also so I think we will

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.460 
plays a big role also so I think we will
have<00:02:03.340> much<00:02:03.730> more<00:02:03.760> solid<00:02:04.480> numbers<00:02:04.930> as<00:02:05.140> we<00:02:05.320> go

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
have much more solid numbers as we go

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.550 
have much more solid numbers as we go
forward<00:02:05.800> as<00:02:06.220> we<00:02:06.430> change<00:02:07.000> all<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.720> lights<00:02:07.960> in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
forward as we change all the lights in

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.510 
forward as we change all the lights in
the<00:02:08.770> city<00:02:09.010> to<00:02:09.280> LED<00:02:09.760> and<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.240> compare<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.750> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the city to LED and then compare it to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.010 
the city to LED and then compare it to
2008-2009<00:02:12.520> numbers

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.130 

the<00:02:17.560> main<00:02:17.890> purpose<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.700> our<00:02:19.140> installations

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.400 
which is about 54,000 is to let us know
if<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.310> fixtures<00:02:24.820> are<00:02:25.030> working<00:02:25.390> or<00:02:25.540> not<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.170> we

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
if the fixtures are working or not so we

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770 
if the fixtures are working or not so we
decided<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.980> deploy<00:02:27.640> remote<00:02:28.300> monitoring

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
decided to deploy remote monitoring

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.410 
decided to deploy remote monitoring
units<00:02:29.230> those<00:02:29.590> units<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.130> also<00:02:30.370> giving<00:02:31.000> us<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
units those units are also giving us the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.900 
units those units are also giving us the
wattage<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.530> being<00:02:32.770> consumed<00:02:33.550> on<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
wattage that is being consumed on the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.110 
wattage that is being consumed on the
fixtures<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:35.500> use<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.880> information<00:02:36.880> for

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
fixtures so we use that information for

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.540 
fixtures so we use that information for
our<00:02:37.180> billing<00:02:37.660> purposes<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.650> last<00:02:38.890> year<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.460> a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
our billing purposes the last year and a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.430 
our billing purposes the last year and a
half<00:02:39.730> two<00:02:40.030> years<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.540> haven't<00:02:40.750> installed<00:02:41.200> any

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
half two years we haven't installed any

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.410 
half two years we haven't installed any
remote<00:02:41.860> monitoring<00:02:42.250> units<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.000> fixtures

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
remote monitoring units on the fixtures

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.510 
remote monitoring units on the fixtures
that<00:02:43.630> we've<00:02:43.840> replaced<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.530> are<00:02:44.710> evaluating

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
that we've replaced we are evaluating

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.880 
that we've replaced we are evaluating
different<00:02:45.870> manufacturers<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:47.560> what

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
different manufacturers for what

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.400 
different manufacturers for what
improvements<00:02:48.460> we<00:02:48.970> can<00:02:49.210> find<00:02:49.540> most<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
improvements we can find most of the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.200 
improvements we can find most of the
fixtures<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:50.980> we've<00:02:51.220> installed<00:02:51.460> since<00:02:51.910> then

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
fixtures that we've installed since then

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.510 
fixtures that we've installed since then
are<00:02:52.510> remembered<00:02:53.260> drivers<00:02:53.710> so<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.190> wanted<00:02:54.460> to

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
are remembered drivers so we wanted to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.430 
are remembered drivers so we wanted to
make<00:02:54.670> sure<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.360> these<00:02:55.630> remote<00:02:56.020> monitoring

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
make sure that these remote monitoring

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.710 
make sure that these remote monitoring
units<00:02:56.860> will<00:02:57.040> be<00:02:57.070> able<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.640> control<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.510> light

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
units will be able to control the light

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.160 
units will be able to control the light
levels<00:02:59.170> maybe<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.310> am<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.550> lights<00:03:00.940> if<00:03:01.240> we<00:03:01.750> need

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
levels maybe I am the lights if we need

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.790 
levels maybe I am the lights if we need
to<00:03:02.200> demo

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
to demo

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.000 
to demo
I<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.550> pricing<00:03:04.270> really<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.740> key

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
I think the pricing really is is the key

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.940 
I think the pricing really is is the key
here<00:03:06.460> for<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> lot<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.750> municipalities<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.650> lot

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
here for a lot of municipalities a lot

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680 
here for a lot of municipalities a lot
of<00:03:09.100> small<00:03:09.490> cities<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.940> lot<00:03:10.210> of<00:03:10.360> utility

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
of small cities a lot of utility

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.630 
of small cities a lot of utility
companies<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:12.630> start<00:03:13.630> deploying<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.440> new<00:03:14.710> LED

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640

technologies

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.350 

when<00:03:22.270> we<00:03:22.569> start<00:03:23.080> our<00:03:23.200> program<00:03:23.440> there<00:03:23.860> were<00:03:24.040> no

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
when we start our program there were no

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
when we start our program there were no
specifications<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.690> we<00:03:25.810> were<00:03:25.959> looking<00:03:26.260> at

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
specifications and we were looking at

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.760 
specifications and we were looking at
different<00:03:26.740> manufacturers<00:03:27.959> better<00:03:28.959> practices

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
different manufacturers better practices

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.980 
different manufacturers better practices
and<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.160> basically<00:03:30.400> put<00:03:31.000> together<00:03:31.180> those<00:03:31.720> as

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
and we basically put together those as

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.740 
and we basically put together those as
our<00:03:32.220> specifications<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.459> started<00:03:34.030> revising

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
our specifications and started revising

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.780 
our specifications and started revising
them<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.140> we<00:03:35.319> were<00:03:35.440> going<00:03:35.620> forward<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.430> now

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
them as we were going forward but now

them as we were going forward but now
that<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.180> have<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.690> municipal<00:03:38.470> street

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
that we have the municipal street

in<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> whole<00:04:17.949> country<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:18.760> realize<00:04:19.150> we<00:04:19.419> are

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
in the whole country we realize we are

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.290 
in the whole country we realize we are
going<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.109> play<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.320> big<00:04:20.590> role<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.340> we<00:04:21.790> push<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
going to play a big role so we push the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.990 
going to play a big role so we push the
envelope<00:04:22.600> with<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.800> manufacturers<00:04:24.610> and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
envelope with the manufacturers and

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.390 
envelope with the manufacturers and
using<00:04:25.600> different<00:04:26.100> specifications<00:04:27.100> and

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
using different specifications and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.790 
using different specifications and
increasing<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.270> level<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.780> our<00:04:28.990> requirements

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
increasing the level of our requirements

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.590 
increasing the level of our requirements
from<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.100> manufacturers<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.180> think<00:04:31.419> has

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
from the manufacturers I think has

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.810 
from the manufacturers I think has
played<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.900> big<00:04:32.050> role<00:04:32.229> when<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.800> started<00:04:33.280> 25

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
played a big role when I started 25

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.379 
played a big role when I started 25
years<00:04:33.880> ago

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
years ago

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.750 
years ago
frankly<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.110> field<00:04:35.350> was<00:04:35.620> very<00:04:35.860> stagnant<00:04:36.220> and

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
frankly the field was very stagnant and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.120 
frankly the field was very stagnant and
it's<00:04:37.090> been<00:04:37.300> very<00:04:37.630> exciting<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.590> last<00:04:38.830> few

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
it's been very exciting the last few

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.640 
it's been very exciting the last few
years<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.789> I<00:04:40.060> think<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.510> continues<00:04:40.690> right<00:04:41.380> now

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
years and I think it continues right now

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.820 
years and I think it continues right now
with<00:04:42.039> all<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> interest<00:04:42.789> that<00:04:42.940> is<00:04:43.150> out<00:04:43.330> there

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
with all the interest that is out there

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.080 
with all the interest that is out there
what<00:04:44.830> has<00:04:45.010> happened<00:04:45.430> with<00:04:45.550> city<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:45.940> Los

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
what has happened with city of Los

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.060 
what has happened with city of Los
Angeles<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.750> think<00:04:46.990> is<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.350> tip<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.740> an<00:04:47.919> iceberg

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
Angeles I think is the tip of an iceberg

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.670 
Angeles I think is the tip of an iceberg
I<00:04:48.639> think<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.330> very<00:04:49.449> near<00:04:49.840> future<00:04:49.870> as<00:04:50.470> the

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
I think in the very near future as the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.010 
I think in the very near future as the
prices<00:04:50.949> of<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.520> LED<00:04:51.850> fixtures<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.570> reduced

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
prices of the LED fixtures get reduced

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.740 
prices of the LED fixtures get reduced
we<00:04:53.289> are<00:04:53.410> going<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.860> see<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.070> major<00:04:54.639> major<00:04:55.150> wave

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
we are going to see a major major wave

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.140 
we are going to see a major major wave
of<00:04:56.020> retrofits<00:04:56.680> we<00:04:57.070> are<00:04:57.220> very<00:04:57.430> excited<00:04:57.970> with

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
of retrofits we are very excited with

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.360 
of retrofits we are very excited with
what<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.570> are<00:04:58.630> doing<00:04:58.780> we<00:04:59.110> are<00:04:59.139> thread<00:04:59.740> Blazers

what we are doing we are thread Blazers

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.850 
what we are doing we are thread Blazers
we<00:05:00.639> fully<00:05:01.360> realize<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:02.110> but<00:05:02.350> at<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.620> same
