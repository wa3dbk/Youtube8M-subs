00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
somewhere else but I don't know it just

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.850 
somewhere else but I don't know it just
it<00:02:17.160> didn't<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.000> me<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.450> time

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it didn't do it for me this time

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.770 
it didn't do it for me this time
unfortunately<00:02:19.860> um<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.239> said<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.510> idea

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
unfortunately um like I said the idea

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.229 
unfortunately um like I said the idea
was<00:02:21.959> great<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.739> wasn't<00:02:22.920> executed<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
was great it just wasn't executed the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.199 
was great it just wasn't executed the
way<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.840> book<00:02:25.050> should<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:26.000> I'm<00:02:27.000> sure

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
way I think a book should be I'm sure

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059 
way I think a book should be I'm sure
she's<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> great<00:02:27.720> author<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.770> she<00:02:28.950> have

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
she's a great author and if she have

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.949 
she's a great author and if she have
written<00:02:29.250> anything<00:02:29.520> else<00:02:29.819> because<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.239> i<00:02:30.480> do

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
written anything else because I i do

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.690 
written anything else because I i do
like<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> style<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.280> her<00:02:32.430> writing

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
like kind of the style of her writing

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.330 
like kind of the style of her writing
but<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.269> don't<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.720> she<00:02:34.110> has<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.500> five

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.100 
but I don't like that she has like five
or<00:02:35.519> six<00:02:35.700> different<00:02:35.910> sentences<00:02:36.690> they're<00:02:36.900> like

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
or six different sentences they're like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.350

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
there's one part that actually has a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.509

the pretenses are off sometimes and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.640 
the pretenses are off sometimes and
there's<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.400> fragment<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:55.080> wasn't<00:02:55.500> very

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
there's like fragment and it wasn't very

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.240 
there's like fragment and it wasn't very
good<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:56.129> me<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:58.019> when<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.379> closed<00:02:58.950> the
