00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.760
 ah 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.380
 the dance of the sun god and the moon goddess 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.770
 in a very remote time when man 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.460
 he felt part of the mysteries of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.180
 cosmos 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.190
 the sun god and the moon goddess used to 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.879
 together dance 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.960
 later when humans get 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.670
 they disassociated from mother earth 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.390
 one god explained to the other the pride deprived 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:05.140
 the sun moon union dissolved and the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.930
 man you came back to savage he behaved and 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.840
 to the nature damage 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.160
 to the right about dominate 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.720
 emotional the sadness of the human being is 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.440
 seized only one they stopped cultivating the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.760
 unconditional love and by the same path 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.120
 walk 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.870
 sun and moon are the lovers who were 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.320
 destined never to be found since 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.620
 when the moon rose, the sun was going to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.150
 lay down 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.940
 however as time is cyclical 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.900
 the past the present and the future have 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.990
 to merge and both lovers will launch 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.259
 again at par 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 because in the new era the unity and 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.950
 eternal love will prevail in those who 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.159
 they loved each other forever and for all 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.159
 eternity 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.450
 since ancient times the sun god and the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.740
 goddess moon exemplify energies 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.220
 cosmic that allow man 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.260
 understand their interaction with the universe 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.850
 his relationship with himself and with 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.140
 the rest 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.920
 however during Christianity to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.650
 moon was told that she was feminine 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.040
 a soulless being the indomitable the bestial 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:45.540
 dark hell that had no light of its own 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.150
 and that with the sun you had to hunt for 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.480
 shine in the sky what event 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.480
 stellar 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.170
 Sun was told that he was the king of 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.870
 universe the light the only brightness and the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.400
 authority to which moon should obey and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.890
 respect 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 and here was when the fight began 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.730
 power between light and darkness between good and 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.019
 evil and separ activity man and woman 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.650
 nevertheless wisdom to the moon 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.430
 he said that the soul was solar 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.319
 and that she was also an enlightened being 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.959
 independent and complete and that for 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.349
 reach the gold crown and the state 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.690
 solar was not necessary to compromise its 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.690
 freedom 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.260
 how everything evolves and you have to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.800
 recycle in the new era student 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.980
 corresponds to shine and next to a new 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.459
 sun dance 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:53.150
 and this is the apocalypse of the speaker 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.780
 john a cosmic event that will merge sun 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.000
 moon inside each human being and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.120
 that will put it to resonate with the mother 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.190
 Earth with the universe with peace 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.190
 global harmony and happiness 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.170
 for this reason man and woman should leave 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.590
 the struggles back so they can together 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.970
 walk already to the new earth people 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.780
 the lunar aspect is the animal and the solar 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.750
 it is the brightness and the illumination and god the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.500
 created both as a unit one is the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.729
 extension of the other the mirror that its light 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.930
 has to reflect and therefore together of the 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.930
 hand they must evolve 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.560
 sun one is the dance of the energies 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.400
 chincha of oriental philosophy 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.160
 the end of duality beauty the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.570
 fertility of abundance 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.780
 and passion to raise lovers 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:06.110
 a greater awareness and will help the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.110
 planet earth in its ascension
