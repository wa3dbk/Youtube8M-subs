faster then you've got spectrum which

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.780 
faster then you've got spectrum which
goes<00:01:54.840> through<00:01:54.869> every<00:01:55.470> single<00:01:55.590> color<00:01:55.860> then

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
goes through every single color then

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.340
