00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
going to talk about the second part of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.340 
going to talk about the second part of
the<00:00:13.740> website<00:00:14.070> success<00:00:14.759> formula<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the website success formula so first of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.480 
the website success formula so first of
all<00:00:16.470> let's<00:00:17.190> recap<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.000> formula<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
all let's recap what this formula is

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
all let's recap what this formula is
traffic<00:00:20.490> plus<00:00:20.730> conversion<00:00:21.390> equals<00:00:21.750> sales<00:00:22.050> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
traffic plus conversion equals sales so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
traffic plus conversion equals sales so
in<00:00:22.830> order<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.100> need<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> successful<00:00:24.150> website

in order to need a successful website

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.679 
in order to need a successful website
you<00:00:24.869> need<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.080> forum<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.340> traffic<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.180> more

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
you need a forum of traffic one more

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.230 
you need a forum of traffic one more
forms<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.320> traffic<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
forms of traffic and that you need a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.420 
forms of traffic and that you need a
conversion<00:00:30.869> system<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:32.160> your

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
conversion system so basically your

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430 
conversion system so basically your
website<00:00:32.969> needs<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.480> able<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.870> convert<00:00:34.200> your

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440

visitors into subscribers or buyers so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
visitors into subscribers or buyers so
let's<00:00:38.940> define<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.390> traffic<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.290> since

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
let's define what traffic is then since

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.729 
let's define what traffic is then since
we<00:00:40.829> already<00:00:40.980> talked<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:41.760> conversion

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
we already talked about conversion

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
we already talked about conversion
traffic<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> amount<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> visitors<00:00:44.730> your

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
traffic is the amount of visitors your

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.630 
traffic is the amount of visitors your
website<00:00:45.809> receives<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.770> particularly<00:00:47.340> what

not any kind of traffic by this I mean

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
not any kind of traffic by this I mean
that<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.180> need<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> pursue<00:00:55.050> those<00:00:55.289> sources<00:00:55.860> of

visitors visitors that are interesting

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900 
visitors visitors that are interesting
your<00:01:00.930> products<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.469> services<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.730> are

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
your products or services and they are

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.830 
your products or services and they are
potential<00:01:03.539> buyers<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.309> want

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
potential buyers you don't want

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.090 
potential buyers you don't want
unqualified<00:01:06.840> traffic<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.920> do

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
unqualified traffic because if you do

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
unqualified traffic because if you do
that<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.270> paying<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.350> just

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that if you're paying for it you're just

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.109 
that if you're paying for it you're just
wasting<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:10.950> money<00:01:11.189> basically<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wasting your money basically because you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.340 
wasting your money basically because you
already<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> they're<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
already know that they're not going to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740 
already know that they're not going to
convert<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:14.790> qualified<00:01:15.450> traffic

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
convert so you need qualified traffic

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
convert so you need qualified traffic
and<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> talk

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and this is what we're going to talk

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.380 
and this is what we're going to talk
about<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.330> tutorial<00:01:20.090> there<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.180> two

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
about in this tutorial there are two

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
about in this tutorial there are two
main<00:01:21.600> types<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:22.170> traffic<00:01:22.909> there<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
main types of traffic there is the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
main types of traffic there is the
so-called<00:01:24.360> free<00:01:24.900> traffic<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.890> case

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so-called free traffic and in this case

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.179 
so-called free traffic and in this case
you're<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.549> paying<00:01:27.000> money<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.189> visitors

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you're not paying money for the visitors

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.310 
you're not paying money for the visitors
to<00:01:29.369> arrive<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:29.850> website<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> need

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
to arrive to your website but you need

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.590 
to arrive to your website but you need
to<00:01:31.409> invest<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:33.030> generate<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to invest your time to generate this

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.260 
to invest your time to generate this
kind<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.930> traffic<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
kind of traffic and then you have the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
kind of traffic and then you have the
paid<00:01:36.509> traffic<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.320> case<00:01:37.590> you're<00:01:38.040> paying

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
paid traffic in this case you're paying

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.910 
paid traffic in this case you're paying
money<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.000> each<00:01:39.750> visitors<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.740> your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
money for each visitors to get your

money for each visitors to get your
website<00:01:41.430> or<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.970> each<00:01:42.060> banner<00:01:42.450> impression

with two relatively new ways of driving
traffic<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.430> your<00:05:03.550> website<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.600> first<00:05:04.900> one<00:05:05.230> is

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
traffic to your website the first one is

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.250 
traffic to your website the first one is
called<00:05:06.010> paper<00:05:06.430> action<00:05:07.120> in<00:05:07.360> this<00:05:07.660> case<00:05:07.930> you're

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
called paper action in this case you're

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.680 
called paper action in this case you're
not<00:05:08.410> paying<00:05:08.770> per<00:05:09.430> click<00:05:09.760> or<00:05:09.970> per<00:05:10.210> impression

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
not paying per click or per impression

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.320 
not paying per click or per impression
but<00:05:11.470> you're<00:05:11.620> actually<00:05:11.800> paying<00:05:12.220> per<00:05:12.670> action<00:05:12.910> so

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
but you're actually paying per action so

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.090 
but you're actually paying per action so
you're<00:05:13.990> paying<00:05:14.260> every<00:05:14.560> time<00:05:14.740> that<00:05:14.890> someone

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
you're paying every time that someone

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.070 
you're paying every time that someone
comes<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.730> your<00:05:15.940> website<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.660> takes<00:05:16.930> a

comes to your website and takes a
particular<00:05:17.470> action<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:18.130> think<00:05:18.670> this<00:05:18.910> way<00:05:19.150> of

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
particular action I think this way of

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.840 
particular action I think this way of
driving<00:05:19.570> traffic<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.410> ideal<00:05:20.860> if<00:05:21.310> you<00:05:21.370> have

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
driving traffic is ideal if you have

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.060 
driving traffic is ideal if you have

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
in my last video so if you created a

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.150
