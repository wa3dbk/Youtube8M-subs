00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.330
 green tones on this map there with the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 accumulated rain until March 21 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 we see the distribution of a lot of rain 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.350
 on areas of northern Brazil 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 also areas of the Northeastern 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 a large volume of rainfall even from 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.119
 order of 150 up to 200 millimeters 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
 accumulated and also a distribution of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.830
 rainfall over areas of the Midwest 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.289
 and most of southeastern Brazil 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.750
 areas where I have the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.430
 commitment to rain showers 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.340
 I'm talking here about the bay I'm talking about. 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.620
 Also in northeastern areas to decrease 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.350
 the Jequitinhonha valley region and the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 the holy spirit where the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.100
 air subsidence is very strong in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 prevents the formation of these large 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.170
 systems that bring rain 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.059
 has a strong reduction of rainfall 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.730
 areas of the Rio Grande do Sul and also 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.430
 of holy catarina the law also of the south of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.379
 parana until the 11th of March we see 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.629
 the distribution of heavy rain 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.610
 still on areas of the southeast in the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.159
 part of the southeast the amount of rainfall 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.380
 can reach up to 100 millimeters up to 150 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.360
 millimeters of center west of the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 brazil also with a very 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.090
 humidity favoring strokes of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.610
 rain 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.979
 from 70 to 100 millimeters registered in 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 most of the region and we also see 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.180
 that the circulation of moisture from 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.610
 from the ocean to areas of the north coast 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.530
 Northeast is still quite strong and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.250
 they favor rain showers with strong 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.570
 intensity 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.000
 large volumes are recorded 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.520
 especially in areas of piauí and up to the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 March 16, what should we do 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.869
 wait all over Brazil for the trend 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.040
 after the rain showers in the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 previous week 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.420
 is that we have a considerable reduction 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.970
 heavy rainfall accumulation over 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.369
 areas of southeast são paulo already 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.420
 have the predominance of low rainfall in order 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.270
 of the accumulated 30 millimeters 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.399
 especially in areas of western São Paulo 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.799
 we can also see that great 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.990
 part of the mines general region already 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.119
 also has the reduction of volumes of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.250
 rain accumulated rio de janeiro still 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.469
 has a condition that more rain of the order 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.560
 from 70 to 100 mm accumulated 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.450
 even the region of mato grosso do sul 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.620
 also has little rainfall 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.069
 registered nor 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.069
 this period
