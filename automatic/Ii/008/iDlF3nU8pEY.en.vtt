plug is just underneath the here and
then<00:00:31.520> on<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.329> motor<00:00:32.599> is<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.530> matching<00:00:33.920> plug

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
then on the motor is the matching plug

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.270 
then on the motor is the matching plug
I've<00:00:35.149> got<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:35.540> run<00:00:35.899> to<00:00:36.290> two<00:00:36.890> deep-cycle

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
I've got this run to two deep-cycle

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.569 
I've got this run to two deep-cycle
marine<00:00:37.489> battery<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.960> then<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.040> cabin<00:00:40.250> so

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
marine battery and then the cabin so

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.590 
marine battery and then the cabin so
I'll<00:00:41.030> show<00:00:41.180> that<00:00:41.210> next<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:43.790> deep-cycle<00:00:44.360> marine

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
I'll show that next to deep-cycle marine

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.479 
I'll show that next to deep-cycle marine
battery<00:00:44.840> from<00:00:45.649> Walmart<00:00:47.829> just<00:00:48.829> on<00:00:48.949> either<00:00:49.100> side

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
battery from Walmart just on either side

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.810 
battery from Walmart just on either side
of<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.679> cockpit<00:00:52.070> there<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.519> they're

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
of the of the cockpit there and they're

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.069 
of the of the cockpit there and they're
both<00:00:52.940> wired<00:00:53.269> into<00:00:54.010> that<00:00:55.010> plug<00:00:55.600> it<00:00:56.600> runs<00:00:56.899> around

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
both wired into that plug it runs around

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.069 
both wired into that plug it runs around
back<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.890> then<00:00:58.609> comes<00:00:58.879> through<00:00:59.239> again

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
back and then comes through again

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.410 
back and then comes through again
nothing<00:01:00.499> complicated<00:01:00.829> very<00:01:01.370> simple<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
nothing complicated very simple the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.830 
nothing complicated very simple the
batteries<00:01:02.839> are<00:01:02.989> wired<00:01:03.199> in<00:01:03.530> parallel<00:01:04.479> so<00:01:05.479> it's

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
batteries are wired in parallel so it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.290 
batteries are wired in parallel so it's
still<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.080> 12-volt<00:01:06.530> system<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.909> just<00:01:08.150> has<00:01:08.270> more

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
still a 12-volt system it just has more

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.500 
still a 12-volt system it just has more
capacity<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.610> what<00:01:10.610> I've<00:01:10.729> discovered<00:01:10.880> is

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
capacity and what I've discovered is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.310 
capacity and what I've discovered is
with<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:11.960> 55<00:01:12.560> pound<00:01:12.950> thrust<00:01:13.370> motor<00:01:14.080> with<00:01:15.080> two

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
with a 55 pound thrust motor with two

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.039 
with a 55 pound thrust motor with two
batteries<00:01:15.800> here<00:01:16.370> on<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:17.120> highest<00:01:17.330> setting

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
batteries here on the highest setting

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.170 
batteries here on the highest setting
will<00:01:18.409> push<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.770> boat<00:01:18.950> about<00:01:19.310> three<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.119> a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
will push the boat about three and a

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.510 
will push the boat about three and a
half<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.509> four<00:01:20.719> miles<00:01:20.930> an<00:01:21.140> hour<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:22.369> will

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
