00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 Here you go, here and here. 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.670
 This video for everyone who comes to me. 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.519
 he said that he said that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.949
 Lenny wins won I do not know that I help 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.199
 friends but can not win the game 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.010
 then in this video talk that 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 you 're probably doing 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.810
 wrong 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.060
 of course everything I'm talking about 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.480
 here it is up to the champion that you are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.539
 Ergo games and milk game has several 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.489
 things more generally if you won 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.000
 Your lenny is already halfway gone. 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.399
 What's the next step you have to do? 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 team with your elevator team and not 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.530
 run after kill i do not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.480
 wins game can help but not win 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.789
 that will win you overthrow the nexus the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.550
 enemy team then what do you do as 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.489
 Super I know there playing in the top you go there 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.579
 get your lenny and get the guy get the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.520
 game beauty takes the tower of the top deparu 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.280
 pro media media help will take his tower 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.000
 because this is going to cause you to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 if the top of the opponent descends allows 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 to help hold the tower only 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.780
 you are much stronger than him 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.570
 so you 're forcing the material is faithful 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.430
 where your team theoretically well okay 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 stronger against the guys who are 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.590
 weaker then group on the bid and take 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.049
 goal leads the tower led tower 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.329
 guard goes to the base buy join 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.250
 again it takes another tony this will do 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.170
 that you earn game get your 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 team do not want to know what the pac is each 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.090
 stands on solemn going pro midi and takes tower 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.890
 dude it's going to take an hour I'm sure 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.619
 that everyone has been through this 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.430
 is there in the midi training there helping his 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.409
 media take Tony and there goes four people 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.780
 the white opponents team in the boat 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.329
 carry it out on bush bush shoot 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 tower from there early on that hour 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.649
 that you see that the guys just in the boat 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.869
 So you want to go down in the boat to 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.680
 kill the guys this is a wrong thing already 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.009
 was 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.290
 guys already type or already died in japan 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 To die, you quit media training. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.100
 in the boat will not do any good because 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.680
 You against 34 really are 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.180
 the thing here understood nothing for more 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.180
 Care that you are is the greatest. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.520
 number has more ability have more you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.410
 has more damage then it 's yours there to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.630
 try to give a triple that a frame 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.580
 it was much better you stay in 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.510
 midi and continues the force in the tower 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.980
 I see very very much that, none. 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.960
 silver and bronze 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.700
 guys do not focus, just want to know 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.680
 of kill is exactly why it does not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.930
 is winning the game begins to repair 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.750
 in your games now notice if instead 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.350
 you take aim you go after 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.300
 kill 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.910
 from the moment you recognize 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.280
 that business is to take the tower goes 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.770
 start going up if you can already 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.640
 seeing your lenny is already halfway gone 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.580
 The next step is to win the game and 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.380
 to win the game it's just taking everything 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.380
