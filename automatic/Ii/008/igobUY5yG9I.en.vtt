easier<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.079> me<00:03:17.379> to<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.709> think<00:03:18.010> learn<00:03:18.250> here

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
easier for me to I think learn here

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.550 
easier for me to I think learn here
students<00:03:19.389> at<00:03:19.480> Brooklyn<00:03:19.750> preschool<00:03:20.230> don't<00:03:20.410> get

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
students at Brooklyn preschool don't get

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.500 
students at Brooklyn preschool don't get
homework<00:03:20.769> or<00:03:21.129> tests<00:03:21.669> but<00:03:21.879> sometimes<00:03:22.269> they<00:03:22.449> do

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
homework or tests but sometimes they do

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.569 
homework or tests but sometimes they do
request<00:03:22.989> them<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.500> they're<00:03:23.859> not<00:03:23.889> graded

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
request them and they're not graded

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.449 
request them and they're not graded
grades<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.709> take<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.829> focus<00:03:27.010> away<00:03:27.250> from

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
grades just take the focus away from

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.159 
grades just take the focus away from
what<00:03:27.970> you're<00:03:28.090> learning<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.690> put<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.959> on<00:03:29.049> the

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
what you're learning and put it on the

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.159 
what you're learning and put it on the
grain<00:03:29.349> itself<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:30.760> becomes<00:03:31.120> an<00:03:31.269> end<00:03:31.419> in<00:03:31.569> itself

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
grain itself it becomes an end in itself

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.530 
grain itself it becomes an end in itself
so<00:03:32.949> here<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.400> motivations<00:03:34.030> comes<00:03:34.329> from

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
so here the motivations comes from

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.300 
so here the motivations comes from
within<00:03:35.049> unlike<00:03:35.379> traditional<00:03:35.530> school

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
within unlike traditional school

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.159 
within unlike traditional school
students<00:03:36.819> at<00:03:36.909> Brooklyn<00:03:37.239> free<00:03:37.479> school<00:03:37.810> aren't

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
students at Brooklyn free school aren't

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.080 
students at Brooklyn free school aren't
required<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.739> attend<00:03:39.159> to<00:03:39.280> any<00:03:39.459> particular

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
required to attend to any particular

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.089 
required to attend to any particular
classes<00:03:40.629> instead<00:03:41.349> they're<00:03:41.829> allowed<00:03:42.069> to

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
classes instead they're allowed to

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.039 
classes instead they're allowed to
select<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.760> ones<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.239> interest<00:03:43.510> them<00:03:43.780> I

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
select the ones that interest them I

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.580 
select the ones that interest them I
think<00:03:44.349> it's<00:03:45.569> much<00:03:46.569> easier<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.079> just<00:03:47.379> learn

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
think it's much easier to just learn

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.110 
think it's much easier to just learn
what<00:03:47.859> you<00:03:47.979> want<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.310> learn<00:03:48.459> there<00:03:48.669> would<00:03:48.790> be<00:03:48.819> a
