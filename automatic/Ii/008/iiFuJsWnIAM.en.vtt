00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
which is nice because it doesn't take

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
which is nice because it doesn't take
out<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.840> volume<00:01:16.050> but<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> does<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> make

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
going to start off by learning the very

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.670 
going to start off by learning the very
basic<00:01:32.940> one<00:01:33.149> so<00:01:33.479> let's<00:01:33.660> do<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.649> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
basic one so let's do it from it with a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.070 
basic one so let's do it from it with a
middle<00:01:34.950> part<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:36.360> next<00:01:36.570> step<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.899> take

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
middle part the next step is to take

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960 
middle part the next step is to take
your<00:01:37.200> fingers<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.800> at<00:01:38.070> top<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.580> your<00:01:38.729> ears

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
your fingers and at top of your ears

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.150 
your fingers and at top of your ears
just<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.539> of<00:01:39.600> make<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> v-shape<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.800> course

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
just kind of make a v-shape up course

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.340 
just kind of make a v-shape up course
and<00:01:41.429> section<00:01:41.970> off<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.390> hair<00:01:42.660> that<00:01:43.110> top

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and section off that hair that top

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.900 
and section off that hair that top
section<00:01:43.590> becomes<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.310> hair<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.700> wrap

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
section becomes the hair that we wrap

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.060 
section becomes the hair that we wrap
around<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:46.020> clip<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.619> top<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:46.860> your

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
around so just clip that on top of your

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.570 
around so just clip that on top of your
hair<00:01:47.280> while<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.610> deal<00:01:47.789> with<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.030> next<00:01:48.270> part

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.609 

okay<00:01:53.580> so<00:01:53.640> gather<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.390> bottom<00:01:54.990> section<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
okay so gather that bottom section the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350 
okay so gather that bottom section the
hair<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.399> left<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.119> put<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
hair that you just left down and put it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
hair that you just left down and put it
together<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> ponytail<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.160> hair

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
isn't curly right now or there's not

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.229 
isn't curly right now or there's not
texture<00:02:01.830> or<00:02:02.069> it's<00:02:02.220> stick<00:02:02.520> straight<00:02:02.849> you

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
texture or it's stick straight you

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.389 
texture or it's stick straight you
either<00:02:03.450> need<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.929> do<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.410> really<00:02:04.800> rough<00:02:05.039> curl

pinning it down that's all there is to
this<00:02:57.230> that's<00:02:58.069> it<00:02:58.310> like<00:02:58.459> don't<00:02:58.700> make<00:02:58.820> this

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this that's it like don't make this

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940 
this that's it like don't make this
complicated<00:02:59.269> just<00:02:59.840> take<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.440> hair<00:03:00.590> from<00:03:00.739> one

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
complicated just take the hair from one

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.830 
complicated just take the hair from one
side<00:03:00.980> cross<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.700> on<00:03:01.790> top<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.269> ponytail<00:03:02.600> and

side cross it on top of the ponytail and
pin<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> underneath<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:04.430> we'll<00:03:04.610> deal<00:03:04.820> with

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
pin it underneath and we'll deal with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.420 
pin it underneath and we'll deal with
the<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.750> bottom<00:03:06.110> strands<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.070> second

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
the the bottom strands in just a second

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.190

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.430 
gently kind of feather them over and
then<00:04:34.909> you<00:04:35.000> pin<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:35.599> we<00:04:35.720> do<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.260> that

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
then you pin it so we do that so that

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.649 
then you pin it so we do that so that
there<00:04:36.560> are<00:04:36.680> no<00:04:36.890> holes<00:04:37.370> or<00:04:37.729> no<00:04:37.880> gaps<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.450> so<00:04:38.570> it

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
there are no holes or no gaps and so it

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.810 
there are no holes or no gaps and so it
kind<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.840> looks<00:04:38.990> like<00:04:39.140> one<00:04:39.380> big<00:04:39.830> section<00:04:40.640> of

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
kind of looks like one big section of

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.390 
kind of looks like one big section of
hair<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.990> just<00:04:42.169> take<00:04:42.409> the<00:04:42.440> side<00:04:42.770> pieces<00:04:43.099> and
