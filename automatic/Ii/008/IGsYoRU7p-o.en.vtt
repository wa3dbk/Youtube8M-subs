00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
over here we have lightweight and low

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.980 
over here we have lightweight and low
profile<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.979> low<00:01:35.460> profile<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
profile now low profile this is like the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
profile now low profile this is like the
ghost<00:01:37.259> perk<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.770> invisible<00:01:38.100> UAVs<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
ghost perk your invisible UAVs and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.399 
ghost perk your invisible UAVs and
pretty<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.119> everybody's<00:01:39.780> running<00:01:40.049> UAVs<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
pretty much everybody's running UAVs and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
pretty much everybody's running UAVs and
I<00:01:40.619> hate<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.579> sort<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> advocating<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I hate like sort of advocating for it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
I hate like sort of advocating for it
because<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.759> people<00:01:45.210> who<00:01:45.360> camp<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
because I don't like people who camp and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.440 
because I don't like people who camp and
everything<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.909> rush<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
everything but if you are gonna rush I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
everything but if you are gonna rush I
definitely<00:01:49.049> would<00:01:49.380> recommend<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.250> then

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
definitely would recommend that and then

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.090 
definitely would recommend that and then
lightweight<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.509> faster<00:01:52.020> blind<00:01:52.860> eye

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
lightweight just to go faster blind eye

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
lightweight just to go faster blind eye
I<00:01:53.399> put<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.930> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I put that on just so you're not you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.910 
I put that on just so you're not you
know<00:01:55.290> detectable<00:01:56.130> by<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.240> enemy<00:01:57.829> killstreaks

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
know detectable by the enemy killstreaks

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
know detectable by the enemy killstreaks
which<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> always<00:01:59.399> good<00:01:59.759> toughness<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.990> would

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
which is always good toughness I would

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.490 
which is always good toughness I would
say<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> must<00:02:02.100> run<00:02:02.399> perk<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:03.200> your<00:02:04.200> assault

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
say is a must run perk for your assault

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709 
say is a must run perk for your assault
rifles<00:02:04.920> basically<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:06.360> you're<00:02:06.509> getting

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
rifles basically when you're getting

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.260 
rifles basically when you're getting
shot<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.350> don't<00:02:07.530> flinch<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.700> flinch<00:02:09.000> less

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
shot you don't flinch or you flinch less

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.600 
shot you don't flinch or you flinch less
as<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.440> definitely<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.220> must-have

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
as you see that's definitely a must-have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
as you see that's definitely a must-have
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.690> blast<00:02:13.170> suppressor<00:02:13.379> this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and then blast suppressor this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340 
and then blast suppressor this
one's<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.550> kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.750> perk<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:15.990> not

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
one's actually kind of a perk that not

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.830 
one's actually kind of a perk that not
many<00:02:16.530> people<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:17.220> guess<00:02:17.760> really<00:02:18.060> realize<00:02:18.480> about

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
many people I guess really realize about

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.690 
many people I guess really realize about
but<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.710> mini-map<00:02:20.070> when<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.460> actually

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
but on the mini-map when you actually

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760 
but on the mini-map when you actually
burst<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.420> use<00:02:21.600> your<00:02:21.750> extra<00:02:22.020> moves<00:02:22.350> there's<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
burst or use your extra moves there's a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.860 
burst or use your extra moves there's a
little<00:02:23.010> ping<00:02:23.340> there's<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> red<00:02:24.180> circle

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
little ping there's like a red circle

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.360 
little ping there's like a red circle
like<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.470> ever<00:02:25.620> look<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> mini-map

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
like if you ever look in the mini-map

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.920 
like if you ever look in the mini-map
just<00:02:26.670> check<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.390> you'll<00:02:27.480> see<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
just check it out and you'll see the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.260 
just check it out and you'll see the
enemy<00:02:28.230> team<00:02:28.550> occasionally<00:02:29.550> it'll<00:02:29.760> show<00:02:30.030> up<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
enemy team occasionally it'll show up on

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.180 
enemy team occasionally it'll show up on
the<00:02:30.420> map<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.810> they're<00:02:31.020> them<00:02:31.290> jumping<00:02:31.680> around

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the map like they're them jumping around

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.910 
the map like they're them jumping around
well<00:02:32.640> blast<00:02:33.120> suppressor<00:02:33.360> actually<00:02:34.260> removes

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
well blast suppressor actually removes

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
well blast suppressor actually removes
that<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.460> like<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.790> said<00:02:35.850> since<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.540> my

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
that so like I said since this is my

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110 
that so like I said since this is my
Russian<00:02:37.080> class<00:02:37.350> then<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.490> am<00:02:38.610> gonna<00:02:38.790> put<00:02:39.000> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
Russian class then I am gonna put that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.240 
Russian class then I am gonna put that
on<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.600> now<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.320> can't<00:02:40.590> see<00:02:40.800> meet<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
on and now they can't see meet with the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.610 
on and now they can't see meet with the
UAV<00:02:41.640> they<00:02:42.000> can't<00:02:42.270> see<00:02:42.540> me<00:02:42.570> with<00:02:43.080> blind<00:02:43.380> eye<00:02:43.590> or

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
UAV they can't see me with blind eye or

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.650 
UAV they can't see me with blind eye or
with<00:02:43.890> killstreaks<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:44.970> also<00:02:45.120> can't<00:02:45.510> see

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
with killstreaks and they also can't see

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.360 
with killstreaks and they also can't see
me<00:02:45.810> when<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.959> use<00:02:46.110> EXO<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.709> then<00:02:46.890> when<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> shoot

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
me when I use EXO and then when I shoot

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.270 
me when I use EXO and then when I shoot
I<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> suppressor<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> pretty

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
I have a suppressor so this is a pretty

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.900 
I have a suppressor so this is a pretty
much<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:51.030> all<00:02:51.780> around<00:02:52.080> stealth<00:02:52.500> class<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:53.130> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
much like all around stealth class now I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
much like all around stealth class now I
do<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.959> secondary<00:02:55.440> because<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.920> am

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
do not have a secondary because I am

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.760 
do not have a secondary because I am
using<00:02:56.250> my<00:02:56.550> two<00:02:57.270> wild<00:02:57.630> cards<00:02:57.989> for<00:02:58.170> perk<00:02:58.380> 1<00:02:58.590> and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
using my two wild cards for perk 1 and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.040 
using my two wild cards for perk 1 and
perk<00:02:58.920> 3<00:02:59.160> greed<00:02:59.250> but<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.330> combat<00:03:00.690> knife<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
perk 3 greed but the combat knife you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.360 
perk 3 greed but the combat knife you
know<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.260> can<00:03:01.380> just<00:03:01.470> pick<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.830> gun<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
know you can just pick up a gun on the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.810 
know you can just pick up a gun on the
ground

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
ground

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.670 
ground
you<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:03.330> nice<00:03:03.540> aren't<00:03:03.870> or<00:03:04.050> secondaries

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you know nice aren't or secondaries

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.640 
you know nice aren't or secondaries
aren't<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.280> necessary<00:03:06.230> as<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:07.560> my

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
aren't really that necessary as for my

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.680 
aren't really that necessary as for my
scorestreaks<00:03:08.400> over<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.940> only<00:03:09.239> have<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
scorestreaks over here I only have the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.860 
scorestreaks over here I only have the
UAV<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.770> maybe<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.280> want<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.910> not<00:03:12.390> use<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
UAV now maybe if you want to not use the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.470 
UAV now maybe if you want to not use the
semtex<00:03:13.140> or<00:03:13.590> not<00:03:13.709> use<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> EXO<00:03:14.400> ability<00:03:14.790> then

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
semtex or not use the EXO ability then

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.910 
semtex or not use the EXO ability then
you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.840> put<00:03:15.989> on<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.140> care<00:03:16.320> package<00:03:16.500> but

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
you can put on a care package but

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.090 
you can put on a care package but
honestly<00:03:17.280> every<00:03:18.170> every<00:03:19.170> one<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.380> my<00:03:19.530> classes<00:03:20.010> I

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
honestly every every one of my classes I

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
honestly every every one of my classes I
only<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> UAV<00:03:20.790> or<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.150> care<00:03:21.600> package<00:03:21.780> or

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
only have a UAV or a care package or

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.229 
only have a UAV or a care package or
both<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:23.010> because<00:03:23.310> those<00:03:23.670> are<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.910> only<00:03:24.030> two

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
both just because those are the only two

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.539 
both just because those are the only two
killstreaks<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.019> are<00:03:25.709> even<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.370> worth

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
killstreaks that are even kind of worth

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.550 
killstreaks that are even kind of worth
it<00:03:26.760> unless<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.269> are<00:03:27.600> really<00:03:27.959> wanting<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.380> get

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
it unless you are really wanting to get

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.410 
it unless you are really wanting to get
you<00:03:29.040> know<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.280> level<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.670> think<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:29.970> uh<00:03:30.030> what

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
you know the level I think it's uh what

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.050 
you know the level I think it's uh what
is<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:31.709> warbird<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.430> Paladin<00:03:32.910> unless

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
is it the warbird and the Paladin unless

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.000 
is it the warbird and the Paladin unless
you<00:03:33.239> want<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.510> get<00:03:33.600> those<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:34.650> they<00:03:34.860> are<00:03:34.980> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
you want to get those which they are a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.650 
you want to get those which they are a
lot<00:03:35.220> harder<00:03:35.489> than<00:03:35.640> these<00:03:35.910> other<00:03:36.120> ones<00:03:36.360> then

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
lot harder than these other ones then

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.430 
lot harder than these other ones then
you<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:38.130> try<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.670> like<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.970> said<00:03:39.060> UAV<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:40.260> is

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
you can try but like I said UAV this is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.740 
you can try but like I said UAV this is
my<00:03:40.560> Russian<00:03:41.100> class<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.820> just<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.630> have

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
my Russian class so I just like to have

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.920 
my Russian class so I just like to have
UAVs<00:03:43.140> constantly<00:03:43.769> up<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.160> then<00:03:45.150> for<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> EXO

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
UAVs constantly up and then for the EXO

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.050 
UAVs constantly up and then for the EXO
ability<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.709> one<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.160> love<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.820> this

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
ability this one I love this this

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.789 
ability this one I love this this
overclock<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> reason<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.380> love<00:03:49.620> this

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
overclock and the reason I love this

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.009 
overclock and the reason I love this
overclock<00:03:50.430> EXO<00:03:50.760> ability<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.150> because<00:03:51.450> there's

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
overclock EXO ability is because there's

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.960 
overclock EXO ability is because there's
no<00:03:52.110> animation<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.190> like<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.820> do<00:03:53.940> I

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
no animation that like you have to do I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.940 
no animation that like you have to do I
know<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.420> these<00:03:54.660> stem<00:03:55.080> one<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.290> think<00:03:55.620> there's

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
know with these stem one I think there's

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.050 
know with these stem one I think there's
like<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.100> little<00:03:56.250> button<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.670> he<00:03:56.820> has<00:03:56.910> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
like a little button that he has to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.850 
like a little button that he has to
press<00:03:57.299> in<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:58.049> just<00:03:58.320> takes<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.680> couple

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
press in it it just takes a couple

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.949 
press in it it just takes a couple
seconds<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.580> you<00:04:00.030> know<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.209> always<00:04:00.600> do

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
seconds and you you know you always do

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.120 
seconds and you you know you always do
it<00:04:01.049> at<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.230> wrong<00:04:01.380> time<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:01.980> always

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
it at the wrong time so you always

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
it at the wrong time so you always
wanted<00:04:02.400> up<00:04:02.489> getting<00:04:02.670> shot<00:04:02.700> when<00:04:03.690> you're<00:04:03.810> doing

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
wanted up getting shot when you're doing

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.570 
wanted up getting shot when you're doing
it<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.200> that's<00:04:04.440> why<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.860> overclock<00:04:05.340> it's

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
it so that's why I have overclock it's

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.860 
it so that's why I have overclock it's
just<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:05.910> simple<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.480> can<00:04:06.630> run

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
just really simple and you can run

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.479 
just really simple and you can run
really<00:04:07.230> fast<00:04:07.410> for<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.709> couple<00:04:08.040> seconds<00:04:08.340> it's

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
really fast for a couple seconds it's

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.670 
really fast for a couple seconds it's
awesome<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.120> then<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.870> said<00:04:09.900> some<00:04:10.320> texts

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
awesome and then like I said some texts

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.920 
awesome and then like I said some texts
just<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:11.010> grenade<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> mean<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.760> could<00:04:12.000> exchange

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
just a grenade I mean you could exchange

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.190 
just a grenade I mean you could exchange
this<00:04:13.200> for<00:04:13.470> maybe<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:14.430> gun<00:04:15.060> or<00:04:15.570> secondary<00:04:16.079> or

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
this for maybe a gun or secondary or

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.930 
this for maybe a gun or secondary or
maybe<00:04:16.350> another<00:04:16.440> scorestreak<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.729> just

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
maybe another scorestreak but I just

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.880 
maybe another scorestreak but I just
have<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.209> some<00:04:18.419> text<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.900> because<00:04:19.350> but

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
have this some text just because but

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.140 
have this some text just because but
that<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.160> why<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:21.030> is<00:04:21.180> my<00:04:21.329> stealthy<00:04:22.140> class<00:04:22.500> I

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
that is why that is my stealthy class I

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.070 
that is why that is my stealthy class I
guess<00:04:24.150> if<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.390> really<00:04:24.419> want<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.020> said

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
guess if you really want to like I said

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.600 
guess if you really want to like I said
if<00:04:25.349> you<00:04:25.440> want<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.620> move<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> little<00:04:26.070> bit<00:04:26.220> faster

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
if you want to move a little bit faster

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.580 
if you want to move a little bit faster
you<00:04:26.640> can<00:04:26.849> use<00:04:27.060> one<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.300> these

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
you can use one of these

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.140 
you can use one of these
submachine<00:04:28.010> guns<00:04:28.220> but<00:04:28.430> submachine<00:04:29.000> guns

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
submachine guns but submachine guns

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.330 
submachine guns but submachine guns

fire<00:04:46.880> faster<00:04:47.389> so<00:04:47.660> it's<00:04:48.260> definitely<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.830> really

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
fire faster so it's definitely a really

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.790 
fire faster so it's definitely a really
nice<00:04:49.490> gun<00:04:49.820> if<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.720> if<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.169> have<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> shot

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
nice gun if you if you have a shot

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.710 
nice gun if you if you have a shot
that's<00:04:52.070> really<00:04:52.370> good<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:53.090> know<00:04:53.120> right<00:04:53.449> on<00:04:53.600> the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
that's really good you know right on the

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.240 
that's really good you know right on the
point<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.080> get<00:04:54.320> three<00:04:54.620> bullets<00:04:54.919> out<00:04:55.040> really

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
point you get three bullets out really

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.500 
point you get three bullets out really
quickly<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.699> then<00:04:55.790> it<00:04:55.820> sort<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.120> goes<00:04:56.240> down<00:04:56.479> a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
quickly and then it sort of goes down a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.200 
quickly and then it sort of goes down a
little<00:04:56.660> bit<00:04:56.840> which<00:04:57.260> isn't<00:04:57.830> bad<00:04:58.070> because<00:04:58.699> once

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
little bit which isn't bad because once

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.110 
little bit which isn't bad because once
the<00:04:59.449> the<00:05:00.229> rounds<00:05:00.530> per<00:05:00.680> minute<00:05:00.830> slow<00:05:01.250> down<00:05:01.460> the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the the rounds per minute slow down the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.570 
the the rounds per minute slow down the
recall<00:05:02.510> doesn't<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.440> know<00:05:03.560> go<00:05:03.800> around<00:05:04.160> as

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
recall doesn't you know go around as

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.330 
recall doesn't you know go around as
much<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.270> it's<00:05:05.900> it's<00:05:06.169> not<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.380> bad<00:05:06.590> gun<00:05:06.830> if<00:05:07.070> you

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
much so it's it's not a bad gun if you

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.280 
much so it's it's not a bad gun if you
are<00:05:07.580> sort<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.090> having<00:05:08.419> trouble<00:05:08.630> with<00:05:08.840> aiming

flak<00:05:22.340> jacket<00:05:22.820> toughness<00:05:23.810> like<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.050> said<00:05:24.289> it's

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
flak jacket toughness like I said it's

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.529 
flak jacket toughness like I said it's
kind<00:05:25.130> of<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.310> mandatory<00:05:25.550> perk<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:26.120> then<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.300> have

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
low profile

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.219 
low profile
I<00:05:28.160> mean<00:05:28.550> if<00:05:28.760> I<00:05:28.850> really<00:05:29.180> wanted<00:05:29.449> to<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:29.930> could

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
I mean if I really wanted to I could

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.770 
I mean if I really wanted to I could

mp443 but this actually doesn't take up

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.719 
mp443 but this actually doesn't take up
a<00:05:47.450> slot<00:05:47.870> like<00:05:48.770> it<00:05:49.010> normally<00:05:49.160> would<00:05:49.430> which<00:05:49.700> is

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
a slot like it normally would which is

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:50.920 
a slot like it normally would which is
kind<00:05:50.060> of<00:05:50.120> cool<00:05:50.300> because<00:05:50.419> it's<00:05:50.630> one<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:50.840> those

because<00:06:03.260> I<00:06:03.770> think<00:06:04.190> or<00:06:04.669> at<00:06:04.820> least<00:06:04.849> for<00:06:05.120> me<00:06:05.240> I

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
because I think or at least for me I

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.850 
because I think or at least for me I
don't<00:06:05.539> like<00:06:05.660> the<00:06:05.750> iron<00:06:05.960> sights<00:06:06.260> that<00:06:06.349> much<00:06:06.650> so
