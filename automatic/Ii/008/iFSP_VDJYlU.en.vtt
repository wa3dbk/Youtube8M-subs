00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.330
 hi hello how about i feel bears what 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.340
 provided such bandita this because here they 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.320
 I bring another video and guess what it is 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.050
 Minecraft 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.270
 Well, here I bring you a video 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 Minecraft 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.410
 so that edition that is for that mobile 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.500
 for phones something and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.220
 and it's also for the iphones and 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.160
 those are good I was anti that yesterday 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.899
 had downloaded the application which is 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.760
 free that it was only for 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.040
 how could you say new to design 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.680
 you did not have to do any crafting and 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.989
 nothing because I quite understood not 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.000
 there was still no that you see here 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.430
 is the line below I also think that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.310
 for Pisi is bigger since I was 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.899
 playing on the computer and then I 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.100
 interested more or less the truth that I do not 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.950
 it drew a lot of attention this 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.860
 minecraft but watching the videos of the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.890
 from the youtubers that I follow this then 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 the truth that I began to be interested and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.060
 this and I said good when I got into the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.770
 the computer but I was going to buy said 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.690
 no no I 'm not going to wait because such if 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.080
 I do not like it and I was when the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.960
 computer and this one 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.440
 I think I need a better computer 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.390
 well anyway I spent this as 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.090
 very complicated the truth 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.730
 it was boring to me that was the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 thing and then I came and said we did not think 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.750
 that just like this I'm with my phone and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.990
 that comes between me this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.190
 to the market here on android to this we go 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.660
 late night I wanted you to see the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.479
 graphics because the graphics are very 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.360
 good they really look a lot like 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.830
 those of the bike to me are the same is 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.830
 more are the same 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.190
 and I walked already am working more or less am 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 and it was that understanding why 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 which is working to understand 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.550
 so you can see the graphs to see there 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.240
 he looks at donkeys or because they are not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.050
 focused 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.680
 but this one 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.390
 or I was already at night 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.700
 actually the graphics are very 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.269
 good the truth that they look and look at each other 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.709
 equal to those of the computer 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.370
 because as I say , I got into the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.510
 computer and I have him 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.190
 download the minecraft that is free that 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.500
 is one of the oldest ones I think 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.360
 of the first or the first and this 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.360
 I was and more or less playing 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.770
 so that men do not come to me 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.590
 to see here is 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.670
 because a month ago they made him a 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.670
 update a 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.290
 of minecraft from the phone and the one that 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.129
 made 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.409
 Well, it turns out that you could have the 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.709
 minecraft table for minecraft I have 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.530
 forgiveness crafting karting table which is 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.680
 this and this one can already be mixtures and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.349
 things like for example let's see 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.200
 If I want from those little sticks at Mendez 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:34.840
 that is I need so many of those yes 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.870
 If I need the clubs, I need these 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.450
 that you can that the deficil of the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.450
 computer you put the two things and 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.069
 then mix here do not mix here 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.310
 automatically alone here are the 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.560
 they put the tools you can already 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.349
 have tools like these are you can 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.240
 see here one I can make an ax here 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.210
 I can make a shovel 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.760
 this torches torches I have 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.470
 enough are the stick ones like when 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.230
 you are starting 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.080
 and here are the other big ones that 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.640
 they have nothing in the armors here 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.890
 would be the armor and there is still no 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.900
 nothing and imagine that later all 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.049
 we have drop from and where will they go 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.910
 adding more things here you can do the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.890
 bookseller a book and a paper I do not know for 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.570
 what is that actually the different 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.830
 mixtures this I could not do it I think 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.360
 that this also does not have it but it is 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.090
 there and maybe later we will 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.180
 can mix if you can make them 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.650
 others as they would be 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.259
 if you see you can do them 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.900
 Well, the truth is interesting 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.740
 true that I do like this state 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.160
 playing today today today has been my first 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.280
 day of minecraft and this good yesterday in 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.919
 I started because I started the other 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.520
 as I told you in the free edition that 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.500
 it was free but you could more this 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.180
 he was not the one to survive the climb 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.690
 just a link did not put me I did not 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.690
 knew that 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.419
 the truth is good while being 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.210
 also interesting the matter and this one 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.599
 walk the zombies down is jumping what 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.599
 you can see 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.170
 I think that approach does not all 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.960
 there it is there is this 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.639
 I would have liked it if they had seen it 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.800
 day because the truth looks very good 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.900
 from yesterday to the night I was 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.300
 trying the pencil and the the 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.280
 computer and the truth that this one of 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.159
 here the phone looks looks to be 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.400
 Likewise, the truth is clear that the 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:56.440
 floor and there are a lot more trees 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.840
 more giant mountains this and there's more there 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.560
 more besides there are more things in the world 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.919
 be in this one is not just this one 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.410
 there is improving and this one wanted 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.660
 I wanted to want this to share this there 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.729
 for the people that we like 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.930
 once in a while entertain us you see how 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.880
 We are working when we are in the 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.320
 school this has been the book that 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.820
 we have and we are there this means 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.660
 bored because here is minecraft already 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:25.930
 for the phone so that we can 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.580
 we save a little and I more than anything 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.590
 is to understand you to go to this one 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.380

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.910
