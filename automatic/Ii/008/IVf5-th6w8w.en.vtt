and that equated to about four and a
half<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:12.190> almost<00:05:12.520> 5<00:05:12.790> hours<00:05:13.090> of<00:05:13.240> screen<00:05:13.570> on<00:05:13.600> time

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
half to almost 5 hours of screen on time

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.140 
half to almost 5 hours of screen on time
so<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:14.740> was<00:05:14.920> actually<00:05:15.160> pleasantly<00:05:15.400> surprised

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.980 
especially considering that 2500
milliamp<00:05:18.370> hours<00:05:18.580> is<00:05:18.880> deemed<00:05:19.270> somewhat<00:05:19.660> small

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
milliamp hours is deemed somewhat small

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.780 
milliamp hours is deemed somewhat small
in<00:05:20.350> comparison<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.370> lot<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.670> other
