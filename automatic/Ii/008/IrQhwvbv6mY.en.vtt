the challenges we have in this game as

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.080 
the challenges we have in this game as
we're<00:01:32.590> doing<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.010> artificial<00:01:33.520> intelligence

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
we're doing the artificial intelligence

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.480 
we're doing the artificial intelligence
is<00:01:34.210> that<00:01:34.870> our<00:01:34.990> units<00:01:35.260> are<00:01:35.320> organic<00:01:35.860> that's<00:01:36.370> a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
is that our units are organic that's a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.830 
is that our units are organic that's a
lot<00:01:36.610> different<00:01:37.000> from<00:01:37.060> previous<00:01:37.210> games<00:01:37.570> we've

is very direct roll up should the shell

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.870 
is very direct roll up should the shell
there's<00:01:50.080> your<00:01:50.230> attack<00:01:50.500> but<00:01:51.250> now<00:01:51.430> when<00:01:51.610> we<00:01:51.640> go

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
there's your attack but now when we go

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.100 
there's your attack but now when we go
into<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.150> world<00:01:52.390> like<00:01:52.570> battle<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:52.960> middle

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
into a world like battle for middle

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.660 
into a world like battle for middle
earth<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.500> creatures<00:01:53.890> are<00:01:54.010> organic<00:01:54.490> and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
earth and the creatures are organic and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.550 
earth and the creatures are organic and
they<00:01:55.090> have<00:01:55.240> emotions<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.900> they<00:01:56.020> move<00:01:56.290> and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
they have emotions that they move and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320 
they have emotions that they move and
they<00:01:56.890> have<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.160> move<00:01:57.310> right<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.880> adds<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.300> whole

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
they have to move right it adds a whole

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.240 
they have to move right it adds a whole
new<00:01:58.600> level<00:01:58.720> of<00:01:58.900> complexity<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.040> for<00:02:00.220> example

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
new level of complexity so for example

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.580 
new level of complexity so for example
Riders<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:00.970> Rohan<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.750> they<00:02:01.960> ride<00:02:02.170> up<00:02:02.200> on<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
Riders of Rohan as they ride up on the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.850 
Riders of Rohan as they ride up on the
horses<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.130> not<00:02:03.280> only<00:02:04.320> close<00:02:05.320> initiative

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
horses it's not only close initiative

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.890 
horses it's not only close initiative
but<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> forces<00:02:06.729> themselves<00:02:07.030> have<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.660> react

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
but the forces themselves have to react

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.600 
but the forces themselves have to react
like

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.440 

one<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.760> things<00:02:14.910> we're<00:02:15.030> trying<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.360> in

one of the things we're trying to do in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.690 
one of the things we're trying to do in
the<00:02:15.510> battle<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:15.780> middle<00:02:16.050> earth<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.590> add<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> lot

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the battle for middle earth is add a lot

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
the battle for middle earth is add a lot
of<00:02:18.080> formation<00:02:19.080> gameplay<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.770> see<00:02:19.890> from

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
of formation gameplay you can see from

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.980 
of formation gameplay you can see from
the<00:02:20.160> films<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.520> formations<00:02:21.360> are<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> very<00:02:21.720> key

of the key things that you can do with

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
of the key things that you can do with
your<00:02:27.930> units<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.710> can<00:02:28.860> even<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.370> units

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
your units is you can even just units

creatures flying in the air and as we

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.010 
creatures flying in the air and as we
got<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.010> system<00:04:25.400> working<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:26.510> also<00:04:26.720> have<00:04:26.990> to

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
got that system working we also have to

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.750 
got that system working we also have to
not<00:04:27.230> only<00:04:27.260> work<00:04:27.650> on<00:04:27.800> where<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> creature<00:04:28.460> was

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
not only work on where the creature was

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.730 
not only work on where the creature was
in<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.030> world<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:29.600> also<00:04:29.780> how<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.140> behaved<00:04:30.560> and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
in the world but also how it behaved and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.070 
in the world but also how it behaved and
react<00:04:31.040> so<00:04:32.000> for<00:04:32.180> example<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.720> fell<00:04:32.900> beast

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
react so for example in the fell beast

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.450 
react so for example in the fell beast
wants<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.440> go<00:04:33.530> up<00:04:33.620> has<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.890> flap<00:04:34.220> its<00:04:34.400> wings

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
wants to go up has to flap its wings

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.700 
wants to go up has to flap its wings
faster<00:04:35.120> or<00:04:35.810> when<00:04:35.930> it's<00:04:36.020> going<00:04:36.169> down<00:04:36.290> maybe<00:04:36.560> it

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
faster or when it's going down maybe it

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.230 
faster or when it's going down maybe it
slows<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.190> flapping<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.669> twins<00:04:37.940> or<00:04:38.060> maybe

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
slows the flapping of the twins or maybe

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.420 
slows the flapping of the twins or maybe
just<00:04:38.330> glides<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.830> those<00:04:39.950> are<00:04:40.130> some<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.370> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
just glides so those are some of the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.350 
just glides so those are some of the
cool<00:04:40.580> things<00:04:40.820> that<00:04:40.850> we're<00:04:41.030> doing<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.270> make

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
cool things that we're doing to make

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.580 
cool things that we're doing to make
sure<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.750> fell<00:04:41.930> beast<00:04:42.140> is<00:04:42.260> one<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
sure that the fell beast is one of the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.020 
sure that the fell beast is one of the
