00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.480
 yes hello and again cordially 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.799
 welcome here on kopp tv i will 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 here in the video you now 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.019
 explain a little more detail how to do it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.059
 can respond to it 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 that was more the perpetrators can take 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 or that you generally have more windows on 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.340
 can get 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.279
 Furthermore, the question was still my question 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.580
 pc has everything for components in that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 me on a tight 30 the tv comedy me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 can take 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.540
 That's why I have this at the side 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.860
 just listed with 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.910
 all that matters is what you know 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.879
 would have or what effect what is 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.680
 I have an impact on the performance here 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.289
 with packed , what else can we do ? 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 So the most important thing is to do that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.309
 just that you go and in the game 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.539
 on options down here and on her 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.309
 take it then I have one now 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 Relatively large resolution because it is easy 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.480
 then it works but that has with 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.939
 the power of the pc then turn to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 so would have to do the smallest resolution 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.240
 which takes it and then not in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.189
 230 bp but the 16 bp so very small 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 and best still the shadow 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.810
 hide 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.060
 Well, that's what I needed here 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 no case to go because that is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 that's okay 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.890
 normally the graphics card needs it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.689
 your gpu and i will not bring that on 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 cpu and it makes no sense that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.869
 cpu continue to burden and oh well 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.420
 otherwise I do not have everything 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.610
 and so on everything made up because that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740
 the blue is not at all and moment for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.659
 the topic directly go here times 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.630
 very small with it one time 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.530
 imagination has what that means and so 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 start that now 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.400
 That's the window is essential 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 smaller than the others who else on 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.290
 you can see that needs of course then 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.729
 also less memory respectively 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.020
 more or less computing power is there 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.610
 always the same problem is 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.080
 So the RAM is nice and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.610
 good but sometime is not more 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.520
 RAM the problem but only 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.890
 still the processor and me with the 32nd 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.960
 gigabyte of RAM come very well 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.930
 I do not even get out of it 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.790
 busy with media at 30 windows 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.800
 I have a memory usage 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.470
 from 18 to 19 gb that means we take 24 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.410
 would would also go somewhere and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.790
 the question if it makes sense of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.830
 slot jana and the cpu however 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.290
 so are the processor that is then 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.960
 really pretty close to the limit 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.910
 30 It depends on how 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.730
 the mobs come at 100 percent 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.290
 utilization and then it is clear if you 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.989
 a smaller processor has come then 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.660
 do not chase after that 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.520
 the rake can sometimes problems 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.950
 but you get over it like drum 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.570
 around if you do it like me 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.100
 now just shown you can there 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.760
 again a few more windows 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.770
 revoke 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.690
 still gets a place a bit more 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.730
 and that can be quite helpful for some 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.970
 if you have a window open otherwise 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.500
 get adjoins 23 will of course 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.030
 then again in the game everything possible 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.910
 Hide on the stars you do not 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.470
 needs and then you come with it 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.120
 better again, yes because the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.800
 processor that did not install the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.650
 Do not recommend fish to everyone 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.040
 he is an expensive as well as the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.040
 Other things 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.850
 you can get there fast for that 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.220
 processor to a pc priced and that 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.480
 does not necessarily have to be 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.790
 That's why I would recommend here full 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.190
 to pay attention to these little things 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.970
 make picture smaller 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.380
 the terrors are looking at it all the way 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.410
 other things are not loaded 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.850
 because that's all a bit 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.700
 graphics loud and then of course 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.640
 down processor power 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.960
 or more busy yes me 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.989
 I hope I could give you the video here 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.250
 help a little bit further 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.170
 if that's the case and you have 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 anyway so what questions post then 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.640
 Just below it 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.990
 I will go into the next 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.930
 comments I'll just add something 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.940
 write and then no further 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.980
 video more about the culprits because 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.940
 I think so the main thing I have 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.290
 hereby clarified and on further 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.410
 I will not go there, I think 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.780
 for everyone who was interested in what 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.580
 the pc has everything I can do that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.250
 Yes listed on the side I hope 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.140
 could help with and wish you 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.410
 Have a nice day and have fun until 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.410
 then
