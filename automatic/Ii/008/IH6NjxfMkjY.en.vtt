would<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> probably<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> half

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
would say this is probably about a half

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
would say this is probably about a half
hour<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> 40<00:01:30.270> minutes<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.829> time<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
hour to 40 minutes of time to put it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.859

a hoops it's going to give up a little

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.520 
a hoops it's going to give up a little
bit<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.100> give<00:02:37.280> with<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.050> stirrup

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
bit of give with it it is a stirrup

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.259 
bit of give with it it is a stirrup
steerable<00:02:40.099> tailwheel<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.790> you'll<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.060> able<00:02:41.150> to

do a little searing on the tail dragger
okay<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.269> you've<00:02:44.390> got<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.750> little<00:02:45.140> bit

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
okay and you've got a little bit

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050 
okay and you've got a little bit
oversized<00:02:45.650> wheels<00:02:46.069> for<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.610> size<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
oversized wheels for the size of the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.000 
oversized wheels for the size of the
plane<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.540> makes<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.019> good<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.590> little

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
plane so that makes it good for a little

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.840 
plane so that makes it good for a little
bit<00:02:49.100> of<00:02:49.160> rough<00:02:49.340> surface<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:49.940> landing<00:02:50.590> again

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
bit of rough surface for landing again

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.910 
bit of rough surface for landing again
this<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.269> basic<00:02:53.750> model<00:02:54.140> that<00:02:54.500> also<00:02:54.590> has

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
this is the basic model that also has

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920 
this is the basic model that also has
three<00:02:55.850> channels<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.360> as<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.600> see<00:02:56.750> there's

we do have rudder and of course you do

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
we do have rudder and of course you do
that<00:03:01.850> throttle<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:02.450> there<00:03:02.569> are<00:03:02.690> some<00:03:02.870> options

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290
