developed on their home so therefore

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.380 
developed on their home so therefore
there<00:00:24.109> will<00:00:24.589> act<00:00:25.039> autonomously<00:00:25.310> most<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.269> the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
there will act autonomously most of the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.769 
there will act autonomously most of the
time<00:00:26.570> we<00:00:27.050> will<00:00:27.289> intervene<00:00:27.890> though<00:00:28.220> on<00:00:28.779> points

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
time we will intervene though on points

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.409 
time we will intervene though on points
if<00:00:29.900> necessary<00:00:30.640> so<00:00:31.640> therefore<00:00:31.849> we<00:00:32.150> will<00:00:32.239> just

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
if necessary so therefore we will just

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:53.330 
if necessary so therefore we will just
start<00:00:32.660> right<00:00:32.870> away<00:00:33.489> by<00:00:34.489> tapping<00:00:34.910> his<00:00:35.000> head
