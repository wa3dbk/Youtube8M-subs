for<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> last<00:02:17.709> six<00:02:18.100> years

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.310 

these<00:02:28.820> captive<00:02:29.330> raised<00:02:29.510> corals<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.110> been

these captive raised corals have been

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.720 
these captive raised corals have been
removed<00:02:30.530> from<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> show<00:02:31.250> tanks<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:33.520> we<00:02:34.520> are

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
removed from the show tanks and we are

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.720 
removed from the show tanks and we are
cutting<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.870> Crown's<00:02:36.310> from<00:02:37.310> each<00:02:37.460> of<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
cutting the Crown's from each of the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.460 
cutting the Crown's from each of the
corals<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:40.250> will<00:02:40.370> notice<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:41.110> part<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
corals you will notice that part of the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.840 
corals you will notice that part of the
crown<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.010> coral<00:02:43.460> is<00:02:43.610> left<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.210> stalk

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
crown of the coral is left on the stalk

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.340 
crown of the coral is left on the stalk
this<00:02:46.850> allows<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.420> coral<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.900> grow<00:02:47.930> back

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
this allows the coral to grow back

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:59.600 
this allows the coral to grow back
faster

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.840 

we<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.300> using<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.750> process<00:03:00.990> called<00:03:01.850> symbiont

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
we are using a process called symbiont

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.360 
we are using a process called symbiont
recombination<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.080> each<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.740> corals<00:03:05.130> will

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
recombination so each of the corals will

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:18.210 
recombination so each of the corals will
be<00:03:05.490> cut<00:03:05.700> into<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.240> same<00:03:06.480> bowl<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.960> water

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.970 

when<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:19.370> are<00:03:19.490> making<00:03:19.730> soft<00:03:20.120> coral<00:03:20.480> cuttings

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
when we are making soft coral cuttings

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.640 
when we are making soft coral cuttings
we<00:03:21.980> combine<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:23.210> symbionts<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.440> most

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
we combine the symbionts from the most

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.700 
we combine the symbionts from the most
Hardy<00:03:25.070> corals<00:03:25.570> with<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.750> corals<00:03:27.110> from<00:03:27.410> other

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
Hardy corals with the corals from other

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.130 
Hardy corals with the corals from other
tanks<00:03:28.310> you'll<00:03:28.820> notice<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.270> lobo<00:03:29.690> fighting

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
tanks you'll notice this lobo fighting

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.680 
tanks you'll notice this lobo fighting
has<00:03:30.680> been<00:03:30.920> doing<00:03:31.160> very<00:03:31.400> well<00:03:31.640> in<00:03:31.670> captivity<00:03:32.000> so

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
has been doing very well in captivity so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:42.330 
has been doing very well in captivity so
we'll<00:03:32.900> remove<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.380> crown

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.580 

this<00:03:43.330> crown<00:03:43.599> will<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:43.900> cut<00:03:44.110> into<00:03:44.260> several

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
this crown will be cut into several

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.140 
this crown will be cut into several
pieces<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:46.180> coral<00:03:46.599> will<00:03:46.780> donate<00:03:47.349> the

pieces and this coral will donate the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.449 
pieces and this coral will donate the
