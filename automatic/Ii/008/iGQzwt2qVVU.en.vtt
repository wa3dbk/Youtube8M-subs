00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the background you have some gameplay

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.999 
the background you have some gameplay
from<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> alpha<00:00:12.120> build<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.980> open<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
from the alpha build of open a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.310 
from the alpha build of open a
nine-point-oh<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.900> fourth

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
nine-point-oh now this is the fourth

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
nine-point-oh now this is the fourth
alpha<00:00:16.800> build<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.520> think<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.539> bit<00:00:18.660> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
alpha build I think it's a little bit of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.560 
alpha build I think it's a little bit of
data<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.859> nevertheless<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.359> show

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
data but nevertheless it's just to show

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900 
data but nevertheless it's just to show
you<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.380> nether<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.550> am<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.760> talking
