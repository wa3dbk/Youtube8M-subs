 not read anything about it yet 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.799
 now orange instead of yellow give a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 should 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.500

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.070
 wanted k 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 and there is something in there 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:34.320
 Assemble with a few eyes and one 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.110
 more 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.729
 and yes this series has probably again 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.229
 no name I find something really real 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.540
 sad if there is anything in there 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.520

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.590

 figure without names the series without names 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.810
 I do not know what that is supposed to mean 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.459
 The whole thing looks like this for now 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.989
 the other side you could now the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.989
 Put the school in it 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.909
 the whole thing should work here 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.909
 bring the other side on the side 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:00.050
 there is enough in here so me 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.830
 already have an idea that this is here 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.830
 could be 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.319
 and now 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.240
 you can push it up here 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.540
 and then what happens then 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:42.700
 so great somehow yes they say something like that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.950
 I got a funny one here 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.240
 grill in an orange 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.520
 that is what it is me now 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.220
 a little smile 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.750
 orange no yellow and still nothing 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.650
 reasonable in it I had hoped 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.860
 we still think that was it from 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.820
 that unboxing and i would say that up 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.970
