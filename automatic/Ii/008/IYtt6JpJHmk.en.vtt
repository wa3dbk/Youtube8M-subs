started making YouTube videos and the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.480 
started making YouTube videos and the
routine<00:00:09.510> has<00:00:09.780> changed<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:10.349> little<00:00:10.530> bit<00:00:10.740> I've

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
started using different products

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.799 
started using different products
different<00:00:13.200> tools<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.480> like<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
different tools and I really like the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.150 
different tools and I really like the
routine<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.560> now<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.949> had

routine I have going now and I had

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.710

someone requested I do a skin care video

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.099 
someone requested I do a skin care video
so<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.199> figured<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> would<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.949> good<00:00:20.130> time<00:00:20.340> to
