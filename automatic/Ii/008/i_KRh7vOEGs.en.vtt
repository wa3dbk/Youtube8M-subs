00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
right now to lead the team and just a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
right now to lead the team and just a
few<00:01:11.250> more<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.900> Cowboys

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
few more I think that when these Cowboys

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740 
few more I think that when these Cowboys
are<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> slew<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> primetime<00:01:15.180> games

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
are we had the slew of primetime games

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
are we had the slew of primetime games
coming<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.610> he's<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:17.970> even

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
coming up and he's going to get even

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
coming up and he's going to get even
more<00:01:18.420> recognition<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.530> eyeballs<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.280> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
more recognition as more eyeballs are on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
more recognition as more eyeballs are on
the<00:01:20.610> Cowboys<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.240> Melton<00:01:21.630> may<00:01:21.750> move<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.229> as

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the Cowboys so Melton may move up as

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.200 
the Cowboys so Melton may move up as
well<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.490> basic<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.030> go

going<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.420> key<00:04:46.660> from<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:46.840> ball<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.200> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
going to be a key from the ball on the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.250 
going to be a key from the ball on the
ground<00:04:47.530> Tony<00:04:48.010> Romo<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.520> 25<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.390> 5<00:04:49.690> in<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
ground Tony Romo is 25 and 5 in the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.080 
ground Tony Romo is 25 and 5 in the
month<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.560> November<00:04:51.010> he<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.310> mr.<00:04:51.670> November<00:04:51.970> so

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
month of November he is mr. November so

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.300 
month of November he is mr. November so
this<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.540> his<00:04:52.720> month<00:04:52.990> but<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.920> a<00:04:53.950> crunch

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
this is his month but this is a crunch

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.220 
this is his month but this is a crunch
never<00:04:54.880> seen<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.210> over<00:04:55.390> I<00:04:55.540> think<00:04:55.840> keeping<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
never seen this over I think keeping the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.900 
never seen this over I think keeping the
defense<00:04:56.350> off<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.860> field<00:04:57.070> will<00:04:57.310> be<00:04:57.430> huge<00:04:57.670> yeah

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
defense off the field will be huge yeah

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.420 
defense off the field will be huge yeah
it's<00:04:58.090> an<00:04:58.210> old<00:04:58.300> football<00:04:59.260> axiom<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.130> when<00:05:00.310> the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
it's an old football axiom of when the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.010 
it's an old football axiom of when the
weather<00:05:00.580> turns<00:05:00.880> cold<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.420> need<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:01.750> be<00:05:01.870> able

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
weather turns cold you need to be able

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.600 
weather turns cold you need to be able
to<00:05:02.260> run<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.500> ball<00:05:02.620> when<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.100> Cowboys<00:05:03.460> have

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
to run the ball when the Cowboys have

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.000 
to run the ball when the Cowboys have
been<00:05:03.730> doing<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.090> so<00:05:04.330> well<00:05:04.660> as<00:05:05.470> noted<00:05:05.860> with

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
been doing that so well as noted with

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.100 
been doing that so well as noted with
DeMarco<00:05:06.550> Murray<00:05:06.760> be<00:05:06.940> number<00:05:07.270> five<00:05:07.450> overall<00:05:07.840> in

DeMarco Murray be number five overall in

DeMarco Murray be number five overall in
Pro<00:05:08.320> Bowl<00:05:08.530> votes<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:08.950> if<00:05:09.040> they<00:05:09.160> can<00:05:09.370> maintain

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
Pro Bowl votes so if they can maintain

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.820 
Pro Bowl votes so if they can maintain
that<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.450> offensive<00:05:10.780> line<00:05:11.230> maintain<00:05:11.650> what

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
that and offensive line maintain what

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.320 
that and offensive line maintain what
they've<00:05:11.980> done<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.340> far<00:05:12.550> it's<00:05:12.790> looking<00:05:13.060> better

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
they've done so far it's looking better

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.880 
they've done so far it's looking better
because<00:05:13.780> we've<00:05:14.260> had<00:05:14.410> some<00:05:14.560> pretty<00:05:14.590> bad

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
because we've had some pretty bad

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.520 
because we've had some pretty bad
December's<00:05:15.640> here<00:05:15.970> come<00:05:16.900> in<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.140> recent<00:05:17.500> past

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
December's here come in the recent past

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.080 
December's here come in the recent past
we<00:05:17.950> need<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.100> turn<00:05:18.340> that<00:05:18.370> around<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.760> think<00:05:18.970> your

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
we need to turn that around I think your

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.280 
we need to turn that around I think your
point<00:05:19.240> Lindsey<00:05:19.540> to<00:05:19.630> keep<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.870> defense<00:05:20.170> off

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
point Lindsey to keep the defense off

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.660 
point Lindsey to keep the defense off
the<00:05:20.410> field<00:05:20.590> it's<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:20.800> really<00:05:21.040> good<00:05:21.100> one<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.550> mean

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
the field it's a really good one I mean

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.160 
the field it's a really good one I mean
the<00:05:21.760> best<00:05:21.940> defense<00:05:22.330> is<00:05:22.450> a<00:05:22.510> good<00:05:22.540> offense<00:05:22.690> at

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
the best defense is a good offense at

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.750 
the best defense is a good offense at
times<00:05:23.380> too<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.680> if<00:05:23.950> this<00:05:24.130> cowboy's<00:05:24.520> team<00:05:24.700> to

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
times too and if this cowboy's team to

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.830 
times too and if this cowboy's team to
get<00:05:24.820> keep<00:05:25.030> running<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.360> ball<00:05:25.540> like<00:05:25.720> they

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
get keep running the ball like they

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.420 
get keep running the ball like they
happen<00:05:26.290> I<00:05:26.440> think<00:05:26.860> that's<00:05:26.980> going<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.130> be<00:05:27.250> key

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
happen I think that's going to be key

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.590 
happen I think that's going to be key
especially<00:05:27.670> we've<00:05:27.940> talked<00:05:28.150> about<00:05:28.270> this<00:05:28.360> so

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
especially we've talked about this so

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.480 
especially we've talked about this so
many<00:05:28.690> times<00:05:28.810> but<00:05:29.170> the<00:05:29.320> climate<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.890> going<00:05:30.400> to

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
many times but the climate is going to

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.610 
many times but the climate is going to
play<00:05:30.670> a<00:05:30.700> huge<00:05:30.940> role<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.300> these<00:05:31.930> final<00:05:32.440> couple

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
play a huge role in these final couple

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.590 
play a huge role in these final couple
of<00:05:32.770> games<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.160> with<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.280> good<00:05:33.490> ground<00:05:33.880> game<00:05:34.000> you

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
of games and with a good ground game you

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.970 
of games and with a good ground game you
can<00:05:34.780> prove<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.080> more<00:05:35.260> successful<00:05:35.770> so

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
can prove you more successful so

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.440 
can prove you more successful so
hopefully<00:05:36.670> that<00:05:36.820> will<00:05:36.910> be<00:05:37.000> able<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.150> work<00:05:37.300> out

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
hopefully that will be able to work out

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.940 
hopefully that will be able to work out
for<00:05:37.660> this<00:05:37.780> team<00:05:38.020> yeah<00:05:38.230> obviously<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.680> lot<00:05:38.800> of

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
for this team yeah obviously a lot of

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.350 
for this team yeah obviously a lot of
teams<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:39.250> are<00:05:39.430> desperate<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:39.850> pass-happy

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
teams that are desperate and pass-happy

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.090 
teams that are desperate and pass-happy
down<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.930> stretch<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.290> know<00:05:41.380> Andrew<00:05:41.800> Luck<00:05:41.950> is

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
down the stretch you know Andrew Luck is

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.530 
down the stretch you know Andrew Luck is
gonna<00:05:42.280> be<00:05:42.400> there<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.580> can<00:05:42.640> see<00:05:42.730> Cutler<00:05:43.270> and

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
gonna be there you can see Cutler and

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.110 
gonna be there you can see Cutler and
see<00:05:44.080> Eli<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.410> sunday<00:05:44.950> so<00:05:45.400> I<00:05:45.430> think<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:46.000> more

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
see Eli the sunday so I think the more

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
see Eli the sunday so I think the more
pressure<00:05:46.330> we<00:05:46.510> can<00:05:46.540> get<00:05:46.690> from<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.900> D<00:05:47.020> line

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
pressure we can get from the D line

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.660 
pressure we can get from the D line
it'll<00:05:47.410> help<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.710> corners<00:05:48.010> in<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.220> back<00:05:48.400> and

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
it'll help the corners in the back and

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.300 
it'll help the corners in the back and
hopefully<00:05:49.300> keep<00:05:49.660> us<00:05:49.840> off<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.170> field<00:05:50.380> it'll<00:05:51.220> be

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
hopefully keep us off the field it'll be

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.980 
hopefully keep us off the field it'll be
interesting<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.760> say<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.120> least<00:05:52.360> but<00:05:52.810> that's

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990
