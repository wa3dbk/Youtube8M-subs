 this is definitely last year's update 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.750
 the flagship of the company seems to be special 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.960
 there is no difference between devices 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 they are very similar but firstly new 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.500
 there is a 5 inch screen against 4.7 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.230

 same rounding down and comfortable 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 hidden on the side entrance for the headset on the side 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.170
 there was a power button which 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.690
 will be either under big or under 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 middle finger the button itself looks very 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.549
 resembles similar in sony xperia on 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.890

 and the backdrop is a little textured 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 the glass pleasantly cools the hand and leaves 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.250
 exceptionally positive impression 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 the device is monolithic but not protected from 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.930
 exposure to dust or water we saw 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.119
 while two colors are white and black and maybe 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.610
 in the future there will be new colors for example 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500

 last year's flagship 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.520
