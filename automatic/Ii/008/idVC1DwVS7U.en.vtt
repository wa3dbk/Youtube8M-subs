00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
find in the entire wave he is probably

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.930 
find in the entire wave he is probably
the<00:05:41.240> hardest<00:05:41.720> one<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:42.650> find<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.550> next<00:05:43.730> one

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
would be the Imperial Guard so I mean
