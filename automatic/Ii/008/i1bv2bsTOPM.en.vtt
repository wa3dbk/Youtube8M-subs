00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the da up to it the air hoses leak a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
the da up to it the air hoses leak a
little<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> even<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> very<00:01:28.560> new<00:01:28.680> air

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
little bit I even it's a very new air

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
little bit I even it's a very new air
hose<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.189> haven't<00:01:29.430> tightened<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> couplers

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hose I haven't tightened up the couplers

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.530 
hose I haven't tightened up the couplers
or<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.079> put<00:01:31.439> any<00:01:31.619> pipe<00:01:31.890> built<00:01:32.130> bottom<00:01:32.430> yet<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
or I put any pipe built bottom yet but

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.390 
or I put any pipe built bottom yet but
we're<00:01:33.659> gonna<00:01:33.750> plug<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.500> thing<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.159> now

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
we're gonna plug this thing back in now

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
we're gonna plug this thing back in now
obviously<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.060> leaking<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> tank

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
obviously it's leaking so that the tank

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.950 
obviously it's leaking so that the tank
is<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:38.430> dropping<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.780> about

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
is is dropping down it's down to about

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
is is dropping down it's down to about
almost<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.500> hundred<00:01:40.590> pounds<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.310> or<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.670> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
almost a hundred pounds now or just just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
almost a hundred pounds now or just just
over<00:01:42.210> 100<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.049> let's<00:01:43.200> plug<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.649> let<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
over 100 so let's plug it in let it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.580 
over 100 so let's plug it in let it
build<00:01:44.040> up

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.410 

the<00:01:51.979> pressure<00:01:52.250> shuts<00:01:52.729> off<00:01:52.969> we're<00:01:53.210> going<00:01:53.359> to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the pressure shuts off we're going to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.399 
the pressure shuts off we're going to
fire<00:01:53.600> up<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.929> DA<00:01:54.109> how<00:01:54.829> much

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
fire up the DA how much

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.950 

pretty<00:02:02.619> quick

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.000 

whole<00:02:10.290> tomorrow<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
whole tomorrow I think

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.360 
whole tomorrow I think
she's<00:02:12.220> not<00:02:12.400> going<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.700> help<00:02:12.879> it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.430 

very<00:02:21.239> excited

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:38.730 

a<00:02:27.500> little<00:02:28.010> bit<00:02:28.130> bigger<00:02:28.550> we<00:02:28.820> need<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.360> 30-gallon

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.750 

it<00:02:39.740> looks<00:02:39.890> like<00:02:40.010> about<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> hundred<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
it looks like about a hundred and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.150 
it looks like about a hundred and
roughly<00:02:41.570> hundred<00:02:41.810> fifty<00:02:42.020> pounds<00:02:42.380> let's<00:02:42.980> fire

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
roughly hundred fifty pounds let's fire

00:02:43.160 --> 00:03:41.760 
roughly hundred fifty pounds let's fire
up<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.340> do<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.700> watch<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.970> thing<00:02:44.180> dropped

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.670 

all<00:03:42.340> right

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.839 

so<00:03:45.680> you've<00:03:45.829> seen<00:03:46.010> how<00:03:46.129> quick<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.519> dropped

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
so you've seen how quick that dropped

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.149 
so you've seen how quick that dropped
off<00:03:47.060> my<00:03:47.900> recommendation<00:03:48.530> for<00:03:48.560> bodywork

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
off my recommendation for bodywork

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.479 
off my recommendation for bodywork
probably<00:03:49.819> not<00:03:50.030> for<00:03:51.019> impact<00:03:51.530> gun<00:03:51.799> maybe<00:03:52.189> air

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
probably not for impact gun maybe air

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.670 
probably not for impact gun maybe air
ratchet<00:03:52.730> stuff<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:53.719> short<00:03:53.989> burst<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.469> think

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
ratchet stuff with short burst I think

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.739 
ratchet stuff with short burst I think
it<00:03:54.769> would<00:03:54.889> be<00:03:55.010> just<00:03:55.249> fine<00:03:55.519> but<00:03:55.819> for<00:03:55.999> running<00:03:56.659> a

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:56.749 
it would be just fine but for running a

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.280 
it would be just fine but for running a
DA<00:03:56.989> or<00:03:57.829> even<00:03:58.129> a<00:03:58.189> cut-off<00:03:58.430> wheel<00:03:58.989> unless<00:03:59.989> it's

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
DA or even a cut-off wheel unless it's

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.530 
DA or even a cut-off wheel unless it's
this<00:04:00.409> very<00:04:00.650> small<00:04:00.769> paint<00:04:01.310> gun<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.790> wouldn't<00:04:02.480> do

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
this very small paint gun I wouldn't do

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.819 
this very small paint gun I wouldn't do
it<00:04:02.659> unless<00:04:02.719> like<00:04:03.079> I<00:04:03.200> said<00:04:03.409> you're<00:04:03.530> doing<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
it unless like I said you're doing a

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:04.869 
it unless like I said you're doing a
thunder<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.250> you're<00:04:04.340> gonna<00:04:04.459> have<00:04:04.639> a<00:04:04.670> lot<00:04:04.849> of

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
thunder and you're gonna have a lot of

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.640 
thunder and you're gonna have a lot of
downtime<00:04:05.180> because<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.260> got<00:04:06.409> to<00:04:06.500> wait<00:04:06.620> for

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
downtime because you got to wait for

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.830 
downtime because you got to wait for
this<00:04:06.859> thing<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.099> build<00:04:07.340> up<00:04:07.549> my<00:04:08.060> recommendation

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840
