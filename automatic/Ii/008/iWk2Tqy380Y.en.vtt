00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
melee beast so let's go ahead and take a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.570 
melee beast so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:05:27.510> at<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:28.170> motion<00:05:28.470> skill<00:05:29.070> tree<00:05:29.280> right<00:05:29.550> here

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
look at the motion skill tree right here

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.060 
look at the motion skill tree right here
you<00:05:30.300> take<00:05:30.450> a<00:05:30.510> look<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:30.870> have<00:05:31.140> accelerate

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
you take a look I have accelerate

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.760 
you take a look I have accelerate
because<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:33.030> San<00:05:33.270> Hall<00:05:33.480> shoots<00:05:33.840> slow<00:05:34.230> so<00:05:34.680> we

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
because the San Hall shoots slow so we

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.900 
because the San Hall shoots slow so we
want<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:35.010> try<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.220> get<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.460> bullets<00:05:35.790> they're

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
want to try to get the bullets they're

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.610 
want to try to get the bullets they're
just<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.270> little<00:05:36.390> bit<00:05:36.630> faster<00:05:37.020> but<00:05:37.410> also

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
just a little bit faster but also

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.740 
just a little bit faster but also
because<00:05:38.550> you<00:05:38.580> know<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:38.910> faster<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:39.390> can<00:05:39.510> kill

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
because you know the faster you can kill

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.170 
because you know the faster you can kill
enemies<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.500> facet<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.070> this<00:05:41.190> build<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.730> gonna

gonna<00:06:03.870> want<00:06:04.140> to<00:06:04.170> increase<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.620> duration<00:06:04.770> of

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
gonna want to increase the duration of

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.430 
gonna want to increase the duration of
your<00:06:05.280> phase<00:06:05.490> lock<00:06:05.790> because<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.600> is<00:06:06.780> always

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
your phase lock because this is always

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.290 
your phase lock because this is always
built<00:06:07.860> around<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:08.430> phase<00:06:08.640> lock<00:06:08.850> this<00:06:09.000> whole

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
built around the phase lock this whole

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.720 
built around the phase lock this whole
build<00:06:09.690> so<00:06:10.200> we<00:06:10.380> got<00:06:10.500> converge<00:06:10.890> because<00:06:11.520> like<00:06:11.640> I

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
build so we got converge because like I

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.270 
build so we got converge because like I
said<00:06:11.820> it<00:06:12.000> ruins<00:06:12.570> slags<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:13.560> Letcher<00:06:14.010> keeps

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
said it ruins slags and Letcher keeps

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.020 
said it ruins slags and Letcher keeps
and<00:06:14.430> burns<00:06:15.180> some<00:06:16.110> nearby<00:06:16.740> enemies<00:06:17.280> so<00:06:17.520> as<00:06:17.730> soon

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
and burns some nearby enemies so as soon

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.670 
and burns some nearby enemies so as soon
as<00:06:18.150> we<00:06:18.210> phase<00:06:18.570> lock<00:06:18.810> that<00:06:18.960> this<00:06:19.080> is<00:06:19.200> gonna<00:06:19.320> suck

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
as we phase lock that this is gonna suck

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.860 
as we phase lock that this is gonna suck
everybody<00:06:20.280> in<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.850> it's<00:06:21.210> gonna<00:06:21.360> hit<00:06:21.720> them

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
to carry a slag with the weapon with you

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.940 
to carry a slag with the weapon with you
all<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.460> time<00:06:26.700> so<00:06:27.090> then<00:06:27.690> quicken<00:06:28.290> of<00:06:28.590> course

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
all the time so then quicken of course

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.760 
all the time so then quicken of course
the<00:06:29.430> 30%<00:06:29.940> cooldown<00:06:30.600> Rick<00:06:30.870> on<00:06:31.200> top<00:06:31.560> of<00:06:31.710> the

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
the 30% cooldown Rick on top of the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.920 
the 30% cooldown Rick on top of the
legendary<00:06:32.310> uh<00:06:32.430> siren<00:06:33.330> mod<00:06:33.479> for

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
legendary uh siren mod for

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.189 
legendary uh siren mod for
%<00:06:34.380> so<00:06:34.680> we<00:06:34.800> have<00:06:34.919> a<00:06:34.949> 70%<00:06:35.669> cooled<00:06:36.270> out<00:06:36.419> rate<00:06:36.690> with

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
% so we have a 70% cooled out rate with

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.620 
% so we have a 70% cooled out rate with
our<00:06:37.410> phase<00:06:37.620> lock<00:06:38.000> absolutely<00:06:39.000> amazing<00:06:39.449> and

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
our phase lock absolutely amazing and

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.499 
our phase lock absolutely amazing and
this<00:06:39.960> is<00:06:40.110> the<00:06:40.229> kicker<00:06:40.500> right<00:06:40.800> here

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
this is the kicker right here

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.629 
this is the kicker right here
subsequence<00:06:42.650> subsequence<00:06:43.650> is<00:06:43.830> a<00:06:43.889> skill<00:06:44.400> that

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
subsequence subsequence is a skill that

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.790 
subsequence subsequence is a skill that
will<00:06:45.060> allow<00:06:45.360> you<00:06:45.419> once<00:06:45.870> you<00:06:46.020> kill<00:06:46.320> an<00:06:46.470> enemy

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
will allow you once you kill an enemy

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.129 
will allow you once you kill an enemy
that<00:06:46.830> was<00:06:47.250> phase<00:06:47.610> lock<00:06:47.910> it<00:06:48.120> will<00:06:48.600> search<00:06:48.900> out

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
that was phase lock it will search out

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.560 
that was phase lock it will search out
another<00:06:49.680> enemy<00:06:49.949> pick<00:06:50.699> them<00:06:50.880> up<00:06:51.000> phase<00:06:51.270> locking

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
another enemy pick them up phase locking

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.020 
another enemy pick them up phase locking
you<00:06:52.080> can<00:06:52.289> pretty<00:06:52.530> much<00:06:52.770> hit<00:06:53.009> about<00:06:53.310> three<00:06:53.970> to

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
you can pretty much hit about three to

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.409 
you can pretty much hit about three to
four<00:06:54.570> enemies<00:06:55.169> with<00:06:55.770> one<00:06:56.160> phase<00:06:56.520> lock<00:06:56.880> which
