think they have enough in them to knock

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.309 
think they have enough in them to knock
Germany<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.819> let<00:02:12.030> me

quarterfinals I think that this was the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.980 
quarterfinals I think that this was the
first<00:05:43.039> time<00:05:43.219> they<00:05:43.460> qualified<00:05:44.389> from<00:05:44.629> the<00:05:44.750> group
