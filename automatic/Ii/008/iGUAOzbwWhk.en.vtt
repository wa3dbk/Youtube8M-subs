00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.450
 bad serial which i called to lord in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.300
 this program I will push their heads together 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.759
 famous flora pvp leaders of azeroth 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.279
 So the first issue will be devoted to the topic. 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.490
 how the alliance perceives the horde of black 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.860
 iremia barrier in the hill then two famous 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.100
 Laura was used leader Tishinsky 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.809
 Well, let's start my discussion 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.750
 I needed a policy 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.190
 advertising advertising and guilds when our 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.340
 the guild was on the makings of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.559
 development we had time to write 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.539
 some nasty some Sorka 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.250
 on the forum and annoy all and easier 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.199
 we don't need it now 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.170
 the benefit is seo but we are not like 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.719
 John will find out now but at least I don't know 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.239
 than we don't need it really in 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.670
 self- discipline a little bit not 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:11.259
 assembled especially in terms of rbg forever happens 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.810
 that there is no gunner gunner 20 something 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.459
 it is not then it is not here 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:25.270
 really cheese bug we have now 

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:28.539
 problems need with problems yaryly 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.640
 collect when they start gathering at 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.429
 there is not enough of us 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.679
 have 12 but always take random 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.819
 hand it seems that the brain device is not 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:43.989
 stress we have problems the second listened 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:46.869
 records of this step each well yes it is 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:50.380
 really a record by which 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:02:00.690
 you can lose weight the current state of affairs 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:04.690
 all heard the machine itself you somehow there 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.310
 started each other blaming something 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.890
 brightly angry hordes 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.590
 I just have guys with whom I 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:18.340
 there in anger checks what they like in 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.350
 anger well yes not shameful shit like 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.510
 don't know fun tell us and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.430
 yes really very fun not well 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.330
 look well you're wrong I'm really 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.120
 I understand so that there is about to get much 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:40.460
 dishonestly plays well 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 plating all pay gold coins 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.210
 we will raise a reputation for it 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.280
 any PR not completed wapping us 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.410
 here and they do not want to somehow recognize 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:08.250
 that they are strong, they all really understand 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:10.590
 but as slack I laid out my 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.220
 party I will not pull them when they were a little 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.390
 it wasnâ€™t this they had strong pvp in them 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.900
 the game on these tags is constantly going 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.880
 It is exactly that they put on well on location 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.560
 even where who should be with them 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.570
 correct positioning is simple 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.320
 watched it watched the movie clips and so 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.450
 further actually 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.370
 look at the expense of what they do not win 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.440
 first of all right first 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.960
 properly assembled ie big 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.110
 number of heals well and correct 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.120
 correctly collected oh e class and what is there 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.970
 tagged site or group allowed 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.600
 stand in this label market in this label and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.180
 and khily in this label there is valid 5 or 6 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.660
 groups of melikov in pure form 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.990
 covers there human and does not allow to merge 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.990
 our our bodies or more precisely than what 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:11.270
 if here is the main tactic right 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:13.860
 yourself as thrips well as not 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.620
 I understand then the policy killer is not if 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.380
 they are very strong complex on guys 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.989
 why would they not even they really 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.060
 participate generally take no batches 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.370
 they can only then when they 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.740
 completely there prepare to collect for this 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.900
 month there and then they can yes there 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.270
 somehow get together and speak why 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.240
 when the lights of wards 7 there are some random 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.400
 where is why 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.259
 valiant geraniums 5 of them are not advancing 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.470
 podomnet not a question appears 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.300
 for some reason not drk 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.120
 too tyranny you sit our brand 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.639
 doomed too important well why did you ask 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.699
 why they are not div and I think weightier 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.900
 ask them this question answered why 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.060
 they say you start me a little bit 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.569
 strain translated 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.099
 from hidden dialogue pr fire wards 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.830
 completely open so come on 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.720
 finish the discussion until we have 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.130
 turned this discussion into some kind of conflict 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.460
 and get separated 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.449
 on a more or less peaceful basis to me 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.830
 question circle doctor siuna 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.569
 as it is very seriously all this 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.509
 perceive and just a little not 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:26.380
 understood this here this is not pointing 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.729
 someone in general I play okay in general 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.970
 Thank you for the interview 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.250
 it was one of the rolls of the sleeve ognevich and 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.380
 after that we ask why anger from 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.539
 why am I at the ball in the hall I think the answer 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.409
 obvious man ok what do you say on this 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:43.409
 the reason is very surprising how 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.110
 surprised here is where farta is very strong and 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.140
 strong world pvp 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.570
 and there is nothing tyranny and Fetra pull and 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:19.940
 so loses the wrath of the horde strong 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:23.240
 then you have nothing before f1 sleeve 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.430
 the wrath of the horde is just my friend in the guild 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.030
 war hazard m is not in our guild 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.490
 sleeve up the excitement and he is this and he is more 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.670
 adequate and refers to this because 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.250
 that he is in the first place because it is from 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.260
 the very wrath of the horde he is not from the former 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.630
 evil empire is just he is more 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.840
 adequate constructive in this and this 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.940
 just ardent some bathert dear 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.720
 viewers ask you to participate in 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.390
 voting 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.850
 it is your right to me if you think 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.000
 that bratfishing skim put a thumbs up 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.070
