00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
into the hole the first time I did this

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.140 
into the hole the first time I did this
I<00:02:51.829> didn't<00:02:52.129> open<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.459> hole<00:02:52.640> up<00:02:52.760> enough<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
I didn't open the hole up enough and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.459 
I didn't open the hole up enough and
tapping<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.629> bolt<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:53.959> hammer<00:02:54.230> made

tapping the bolt with the hammer made

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.740 
tapping the bolt with the hammer made
the<00:02:54.590> block<00:02:54.769> crack<00:02:55.129> and<00:02:55.370> explode<00:02:55.909> so<00:02:56.299> go<00:02:56.450> slow

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the block crack and explode so go slow

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.330 
the block crack and explode so go slow
and<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.409> it's<00:02:57.560> too<00:02:57.739> tight<00:02:57.950> use<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
and if you think it's too tight use a

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.009 
and if you think it's too tight use a
file<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.700> open<00:02:58.879> up<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.299> hole<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.629> little<00:02:59.900> more

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
file to open up the hole a little more

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.800 
file to open up the hole a little more
first<00:03:00.459> once<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.609> bolt<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.939> through<00:03:02.180> cut<00:03:02.599> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
first once the bolt is through cut and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.479 
first once the bolt is through cut and
burn<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.170> loose<00:03:03.379> ends<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.889> string<00:03:04.219> and

burn the loose ends of the string and

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.490 
burn the loose ends of the string and
that's<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.569> simply<00:03:05.930> screws<00:03:06.230> into<00:03:06.409> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
that's it it simply screws into the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.319 
that's it it simply screws into the
bottom<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.889> your<00:03:06.920> camera<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.639> stow<00:03:07.939> wrap

the string around the long ends of the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.530 
the string around the long ends of the
wood<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.069> use<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> rubber<00:03:10.519> band<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.909> secure<00:03:11.150> if

it's<00:03:12.230> easily<00:03:12.469> into<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.859> pocket<00:03:13.220> or<00:03:13.340> bag<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.730> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
it's easily into a pocket or bag and it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.190 
it's easily into a pocket or bag and it
works<00:03:13.970> exceptionally<00:03:14.540> well<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.139> a<00:03:15.260> pinch<00:03:17.200> just

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
works exceptionally well in a pinch just

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.420 
works exceptionally well in a pinch just
really<00:03:18.379> quickly<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.680> want<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.889> say<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.189> if<00:03:19.310> you

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
really quickly I want to say that if you

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.649 
really quickly I want to say that if you
decide<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.819> build<00:03:19.939> this<00:03:20.090> on<00:03:20.269> your<00:03:20.389> own<00:03:20.510> you

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
decide to build this on your own you

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.119 
decide to build this on your own you
might<00:03:20.810> want<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.049> splurge<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.799> little<00:03:22.010> bit

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
might want to splurge just a little bit

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.409 
might want to splurge just a little bit
and<00:03:22.340> go<00:03:22.459> for<00:03:22.669> a<00:03:22.700> little<00:03:23.000> nicer<00:03:23.299> materials

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
and go for a little nicer materials

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.080 
and go for a little nicer materials
because<00:03:24.319> this<00:03:24.620> wood<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:25.010> extremely<00:03:25.700> soft<00:03:25.939> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
because this wood is extremely soft and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
because this wood is extremely soft and
it<00:03:26.239> split<00:03:26.569> on<00:03:26.719> me<00:03:26.750> very<00:03:27.230> very<00:03:27.769> easily<00:03:28.010> more

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
it split on me very very easily more

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.869 
it split on me very very easily more
than<00:03:28.579> once

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
than once

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.629 
than once
and<00:03:29.000> also<00:03:29.569> this<00:03:30.169> string<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.829> very<00:03:31.069> nice<00:03:31.340> string

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
and also this string is very nice string

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.179 
and also this string is very nice string
and<00:03:31.819> it's<00:03:31.939> very<00:03:32.090> strong<00:03:32.510> but<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.230> picks<00:03:33.500> super

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
and it's very strong but it picks super

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.789 
and it's very strong but it picks super
easily<00:03:34.549> which<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.730> visually<00:03:35.239> just<00:03:35.750> awful<00:03:36.260> but

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
easily which is visually just awful but

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.039 
easily which is visually just awful but
it<00:03:37.010> works<00:03:37.310> perfectly<00:03:37.669> fine<00:03:38.180> now<00:03:38.480> what<00:03:38.750> this<00:03:38.900> is

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
it works perfectly fine now what this is

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.899 
it works perfectly fine now what this is
actually<00:03:39.379> meant<00:03:39.560> for<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.859> not<00:03:40.189> a<00:03:40.250> tripod

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
actually meant for is not a tripod

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.220 
actually meant for is not a tripod
replacement<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:41.629> something<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:41.959> works

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
replacement but something that works

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.229 
replacement but something that works
really<00:03:42.319> really<00:03:42.709> well<00:03:43.099> in<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.400> pinch<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:43.909> can

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
really really well in a pinch you can

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.119 
really really well in a pinch you can
toss<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.629> in<00:03:44.689> your<00:03:44.930> pocket<00:03:45.319> or<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.650> bag<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
toss this in your pocket or in a bag and

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.619 
toss this in your pocket or in a bag and
screw<00:03:46.609> it<00:03:46.729> into<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:46.970> bottom<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.359> your<00:03:47.419> camera

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
screw it into the bottom of your camera

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.809 
screw it into the bottom of your camera
to<00:03:47.959> take<00:03:48.169> a<00:03:48.319> pretty<00:03:48.590> stabilized<00:03:49.129> shot<00:03:49.370> it's

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
to take a pretty stabilized shot it's

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.399 
to take a pretty stabilized shot it's
really<00:03:50.299> good<00:03:50.449> for<00:03:50.690> stills<00:03:50.959> where<00:03:51.169> you<00:03:51.229> might

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
really good for stills where you might

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.869 
really good for stills where you might
need<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.709> open<00:03:51.739> your<00:03:52.010> shutter<00:03:52.280> for<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> little

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
need to open your shutter for a little

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.259 
need to open your shutter for a little
longer

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
longer

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.610 
longer
but<00:03:53.599> it's<00:03:53.750> not<00:03:53.870> gonna<00:03:54.019> be<00:03:54.109> good<00:03:54.319> for<00:03:54.440> long

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
but it's not gonna be good for long

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.309 
but it's not gonna be good for long
exposures<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.819> works<00:03:56.000> decently<00:03:56.510> well<00:03:57.049> for

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
exposures and it works decently well for

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.110 
exposures and it works decently well for
video<00:03:57.650> but<00:03:57.889> it's<00:03:58.069> obviously<00:03:58.430> not<00:03:58.609> as<00:03:58.790> good<00:03:58.819> or

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
video but it's obviously not as good or

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.119 
video but it's obviously not as good or
sturdy<00:03:59.479> as<00:03:59.689> a<00:03:59.720> tripod<00:04:00.049> but<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:00.829> gonna<00:04:00.949> do

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
sturdy as a tripod but that is gonna do

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.229 
sturdy as a tripod but that is gonna do
