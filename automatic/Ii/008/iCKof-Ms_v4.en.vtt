00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
of one piece and overall guys I thought

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.620 
of one piece and overall guys I thought
the<00:00:07.980> chapter<00:00:08.280> was<00:00:08.370> very<00:00:08.550> good<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.940> enjoyed<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
the chapter was very good I enjoyed it I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.120 
the chapter was very good I enjoyed it I
mean<00:00:09.960> despite<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.410> fact<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:10.889> really

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
mean despite the fact that we really

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.499 
mean despite the fact that we really
didn't<00:00:11.309> get<00:00:11.370> any<00:00:11.550> progression<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> story

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
didn't get any progression of the story

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.940 
didn't get any progression of the story
I<00:00:12.719> mean<00:00:13.019> we're<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.320> much<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> same

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
I mean we're pretty much in the same

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.560 
I mean we're pretty much in the same
exact<00:00:14.309> spot<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.670> were<00:00:14.790> last<00:00:15.030> week<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
exact spot we were last week for the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.120 
exact spot we were last week for the
most<00:00:15.719> part<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.470> think<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.830> chapter

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
most part I just think that this chapter

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
most part I just think that this chapter
I'd<00:00:17.220> good<00:00:17.400> information<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.000> funny<00:00:18.449> moments

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I'd good information good funny moments

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.300 
I'd good information good funny moments
and<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.109> overall<00:00:19.650> entertaining<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and is overall entertaining and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160 
and is overall entertaining and
well-paced<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.970> let's<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.630> right<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
well-paced so let's get right into the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
well-paced so let's get right into the
review<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.070> start<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> chapter<00:00:23.609> off<00:00:23.880> with

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
review so we start the chapter off with

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
review so we start the chapter off with
the<00:00:24.119> prediction<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.600> myself<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.350> many

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the prediction that myself and many

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.870 
the prediction that myself and many
other<00:00:25.740> people<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.189> correct<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> was

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
other people got correct and that was

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.339 
other people got correct and that was
that<00:00:27.000> violet<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> double<00:00:28.199> agent

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that violet was actually a double agent

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.200 
that violet was actually a double agent
not<00:00:28.650> actually<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.609> someone<00:00:29.880> else<00:00:30.000> in

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
not actually you know someone else in

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.609 
not actually you know someone else in
love<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.510> sanji<00:00:30.869> she<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:31.410> working

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
love with sanji she was actually working

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.260 
love with sanji she was actually working
for<00:00:31.949> da<00:00:32.369> flamingo<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.940> thought<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.149> was

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
for da flamingo and I thought that was

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.880 
for da flamingo and I thought that was
pretty<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.630> obvious<00:00:34.260> based<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> fact

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
pretty much obvious based on the fact

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.560 
pretty much obvious based on the fact
that<00:00:34.950> sanji<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.579> has<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> worst<00:00:36.030> luck<00:00:36.239> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
that sanji just has the worst luck of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
that sanji just has the worst luck of
all<00:00:37.110> time<00:00:37.920> he<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.340> does<00:00:38.520> especially<00:00:38.760> when

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
all time he really does especially when

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
all time he really does especially when
it<00:00:39.149> comes<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> women<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.899> things<00:00:40.500> were<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it comes to women and things were just

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
it comes to women and things were just
going<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.250> too<00:00:41.280> well<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.700> sanji<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> you

this chapter and in lost group he's
absolutely<00:03:57.329> screwed<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.989> i<00:03:58.169> had<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> feeling

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
absolutely screwed and i had a feeling

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.750 
absolutely screwed and i had a feeling
duff<00:03:58.829> something<00:03:59.099> you<00:03:59.160> had<00:03:59.340> some<00:03:59.519> kind<00:03:59.669> of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
duff something you had some kind of

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.449 
duff something you had some kind of
pulling<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.299> royalty<00:04:00.660> um<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.980> some<00:04:02.310> way

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
pulling with royalty um in some way

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.650 
pulling with royalty um in some way
shape<00:04:02.639> or<00:04:02.760> form<00:04:02.819> because<00:04:03.239> of<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.389> fact<00:04:03.540> that

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
shape or form because of the fact that

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.839 
shape or form because of the fact that
he<00:04:03.750> people<00:04:04.380> call<00:04:04.590> him<00:04:04.650> young<00:04:04.859> prince<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.400> they

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
he people call him young prince and they

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.220 
he people call him young prince and they
seemed<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.209> revere<00:04:06.569> him<00:04:06.599> for<00:04:06.959> no<00:04:07.079> particular

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
seemed to revere him for no particular

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.379 
seemed to revere him for no particular
reason<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.099> it<00:04:08.609> makes<00:04:08.790> sense<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.120> he<00:04:09.299> is

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
reason and it makes sense that he is

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.150 
reason and it makes sense that he is
actually<00:04:09.569> royalty<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.769> chapter<00:04:11.010> that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
actually royalty so in this chapter that

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.740 
actually royalty so in this chapter that
was<00:04:11.340> pretty<00:04:11.549> much<00:04:11.730> confirmed<00:04:12.209> well<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.510> wasn't

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
was pretty much confirmed well it wasn't

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.539 
was pretty much confirmed well it wasn't
confirmed<00:04:13.139> because<00:04:13.739> doflamingo<00:04:14.099> didn't

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
confirmed because doflamingo didn't

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.129 
confirmed because doflamingo didn't
confirm<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:14.940> his<00:04:15.120> own<00:04:15.180> words<00:04:15.389> but<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:16.019> was

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
confirm it with his own words but it was

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.839 
confirm it with his own words but it was
it's<00:04:16.289> heavily<00:04:16.650> hinted<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.070> he<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.400> some<00:04:17.609> kind

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
it's heavily hinted that he is some kind

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.120 
it's heavily hinted that he is some kind
of<00:04:17.910> lineage<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.959> makes<00:04:19.320> him<00:04:19.470> able<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.769> within

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
of lineage that makes him able to within

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.170 
of lineage that makes him able to within
the<00:04:20.280> world<00:04:20.430> government<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.880> makes<00:04:21.060> them

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
the world government that makes them

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.180 
the world government that makes them
able<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:22.140> know<00:04:22.200> do<00:04:22.440> something<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:22.890> this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
able to you know do something like this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.620 
able to you know do something like this
and<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.610> assumption<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.090> probably<00:04:24.450> related

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
and the assumption is probably related

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.170 
and the assumption is probably related
to<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.169> celestial<00:04:25.830> dragon<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.460> that's<00:04:26.849> what

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
to a celestial dragon so that's what

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.909 
to a celestial dragon so that's what
say<00:04:27.449> about<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.139> this<00:04:28.259> chapter<00:04:28.590> overall

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
say about that but this chapter overall

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.710 
say about that but this chapter overall
