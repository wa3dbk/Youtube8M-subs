 say quick altai guys come back and 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.159
 they come back armed to the teeth

 gun 152 millimeter on light tanks 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.489
 have you ever seen anything like that 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.489

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.750
 brominated opponents of course 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.900
 no head hedge fund soffin him no but 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.720
 yet 8 tragedies appeared new 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.980
 incredibly dangerous rival 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.780
 but our most serious fire 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.260
 power somewhat holds back three 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.780
 factor this is a very low penetration of 76 and 85 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 millimeters for two types of land mines and 152 to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.369
 cumulatively 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.740
 and also scatter 0 6 per 100 meters and time 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 three and a half seconds 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 on armor and dont stop 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.189
 I'll be talking about light tanks 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.579
 just that it is simply not there but it is not for us 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.210
 need 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.560
 equipment following 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.430
 stabilizers and drive hitch steel 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.260
 without thinking and the third day either 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.190
 flourished palivoda salad for himself 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.390
 would choose a salad 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.360
 if you have on the screen and I suggest 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.860
 watch the fight denied my 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.570
 Comrade Kim know and take a closer look 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.320
 get acquainted 149 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 go 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.640
 Since the new tank is correct 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.509
 start with the food kenneth him 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.929
 what about the dynamics I can say something 49 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.289
 it is close to printing but it seems to be inferior 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.879
 him as a set of maximum speed and 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.129
 maneuverability as for the gun 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.129
 placed like on a Christmas tree we are not yet 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:14.960
 faced 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.780
 we dismiss the first gun immediately because 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.360
 that she is able to give us only 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.520
 ordinary and no outstanding gimpu and 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.280
 light tank but if you want to play by 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.120
 boldly to the fact of the article 152 millimeters write to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.650
 the battle 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.440
 of course you won't be with every shot 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.319
 cause signatures of damage 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.640
 you often do not punch removing 200 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.070
 300 400 cafes 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.530
 but then those 2 3 and if you're lucky and more 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.390
 a shot with a club and smoke that you have time 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.450
 make a slaughter 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.640
 believe believe will exclaim from this 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
 cars 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.029
 video then 49 in another gening killed two 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.799
 hares breathed new life into dying and not 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.599
 the class of light tanks and 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.309
 finally gave players a car 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.890
 with a twist 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.220
 and having no analogs at all 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.709
 game up to 49 will be a godsend for players 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.340
 who like to scare but those 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.970
 a gang of which oppresses him 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.940
 mobility as well as for those who love 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.540
 extraordinary tanks 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.620
 strong I wouldn't call him alone 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.790
 drag the pain for the whole team but you have 49 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.299
 most likely will not work 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.129
 but annoy the enemy and cause 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.129
 stream of curses chat without problems 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.389
 also apply 149 on the battlefield can be 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.370
 like a candle to 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.140
 unless passive you certainly can 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.049
 try to give primary for light but 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.980
 then you risk losing kp and even 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.500
 does the avant-garde go 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.930
 but taking some let go and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.710
 highlighting enemies passively can 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.070
 bring substantial profit 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.150
 my team 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.239
 our most dangerous opponents 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.620
 surprisingly it did not sound light tanks 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.120
 kill one shot and most 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.500
 cases it is impossible to leave without waiting 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.430
 when i am also unlikely therefore 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.859
 condor light tactic is inappropriate for us 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.519
 shoot from afar we too 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.359
 ineffective for large scatter 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.329
 targeting enemy vulnerabilities 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.739
 it will be hard and thus putting 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.719
 300 damage 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.329
 we can't realize all our 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.669
 fire potential 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.479
 but the support tactic is the most 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.749
 obvious and competent way to apply 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:15.599
 49 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.529
 video shootout of allies with tanks 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.159
 the enemy try with this from behind and 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.639
 carefully aiming to surprise 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.769
 when they gave the cube 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.060
 and immediately disappears waiting for the next one 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.060
 charging 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.639
 it's time to take stock of the benefits 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.150
 49 and I would take a good maximum speed unusual 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.770
 for Altai guns possessing 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.379
 colossal damage 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.069
 excellent visibility and safety margin 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.259
 allowing you to survive a couple of shots from 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.489
 tanks of the tenth level but for that all 

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:56.139
 we pay all long when big 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.219
 spread and high occupancy after 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.850
 the shot 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.030
 as I said 49a will please lovers 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.430
 unusual tanks and custom day 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.960
 fight 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.900
 if you treat such players then 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.419
 boldly print this tank on this from me 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.259
 all subscribe to you and raek 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.550
 osvaldo was always amazed see you in 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.439
 new videos
