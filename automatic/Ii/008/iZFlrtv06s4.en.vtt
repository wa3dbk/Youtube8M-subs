00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.990
 years of dedication to music and adoration to sr 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.370
 today he tells us his beautiful story 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.800
 Welcome to the caravan play in Mexican areas married to a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 Puerto Rican to do a staging told them that he already knew 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.090
 who was I also have this project is the foot 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.930
 let's see what else we're going to discover people in these soul stories are 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.329
 premiering a musical production however you have a lot of time already 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.799
 the art in the music active trajectory being how it is like holding españa 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.259
 I deserved singing with my mom ahead of the choirs stage three 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.810
 girls and takes away all this time and 12 years 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.810
 making choruses with the songs of de oceana 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.200
 transactional act plus the choirs in which the laws between chari singing without 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.040
 However, he has seen your dream of having his first musical production 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.620
 now 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.790
 how it felt all that time of waiting because I assume we had a lot 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.750
 peace a lot of passion and many dreams 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.340
 in spear rush hour 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's not that I think it's a good time in cadets we do not understand 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 that the man wants to spend more time waiting because those during the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.570
 time God wants to work 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.910
 with that character 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.320
 forge character 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.600
 and during that waiting time 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 have a good attitude without complaining 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.800
 went crazy your bets efe 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.290
 in whatever it is in any alien any it is dream to be faithful note 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.340
 desperate did not touch or defeated has notified the progress of the plans that 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.899
 day that's that that's good 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.879
 these data people organized relatively pp proceeds 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.459
 and when it happens that it's fault it was there but I can not do this but I do not 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.629
 it's a when you understand 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.239
 what is a process 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.689
 and says the word says that when you trust in his promises in Psalm 25 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.159
 5 says min I will walk in your truth 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.099
 and teach me because you are Uncle Sam and salvation and in you we expect all the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.139
 day in the English version talks about 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.879
 expectation 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.620
 so the important baggage the attitude that you have to have then jumped because 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.099
 but do not wait for someone to do something for you 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.919
 and we do not do anything about it 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.059
 not spend absolutely nothing expectant sr what is it enough for you I'm going to 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.639
 do my part but I think you're going to put 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.000
 toast your favor 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.370
 and just open the doors and I'm going to walk says the word of God that the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.739
 protect that amnesty is your word 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.419
 and light my way 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.719
 in the pivot in testament does not speak to me of which one puts to the lamps in the 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.469
 feet 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:13.260
 and Leon could they should see the peace they adapt soups of faith they take to 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.729
 risk 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.240
 stam risked ever then it is clear to us what 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.449
 can endure all those cases years of waiting 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.050
 in the light of God's word in light of those promises of waiting on him 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.670
 But let's talk about the romantic life now, if it's better when there's 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.570
 Excite and wrapped is done in more difficult quito 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.439
 he told me that little bird out there that you got married at 30m 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.739
 so many years that up to now there is a blessed Catalan club up to thirty-something 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.219
 almost 40 dead that the last psn oils details until late hours 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.369
 to Tuesday 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:53.029
 it's like a girl can wait for her true love as she stays not 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:53.880
 only 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.590
 waiting chronologically speaking without waiting in poverty 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.409
 you know that for me 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.819
 it was with good weather to devote my time to serve the Lord 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.619
 always involved in serving what I could services 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.439
 with the talent that you have pointed out serving then that to me 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.919
 obviously the 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.919
 I'm waiting for yes yes a lot 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.840

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.229
 Quentin husband and I where 22 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.409

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.360
 arrived there not only is Libyan husband tumán and carries 108 an arm 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.539
 right kent accompanies in your musical career so it was worth waiting 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.620
 soul completely because when you do 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.340
 and make correct decisions 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.949
 and do not hurry lives presiding over emotions 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.680
 because not much of that does things in his own strength, of course, if he does 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.229
 things in your own strength you will keep everything you did in your 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.229
 own strength and that is going to sink if it ends frustrated 3 calm down
