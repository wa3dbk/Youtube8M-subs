00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
let the video run and let you let you

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:21.290 
let the video run and let you let you
see<00:01:57.399> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.120 

this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> toughest<00:02:22.530> thing<00:02:22.680> about<00:02:22.710> these

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
this is the toughest thing about these

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.460 
this is the toughest thing about these
cars<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.820> well<00:02:24.090> know<00:02:24.120> these<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.900> run<00:02:25.200> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
cars as you well know these can run you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.250 
cars as you well know these can run you
a<00:02:25.500> ton<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:25.980> money<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.670> repaired<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.930> one

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
a ton of money to get repaired this one

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:40.360 
a ton of money to get repaired this one
works<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.740> way<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.220> should

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.210 

locks<00:02:40.940> down<00:02:41.239> in<00:02:41.480> front<00:02:41.920> left<00:02:42.920> goes<00:02:43.220> down

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.070 

and<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.610> where<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.060> limit<00:02:51.390> switch<00:02:51.690> comes

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and this is where the limit switch comes

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.620 
and this is where the limit switch comes
into<00:02:52.650> play<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.280> kind<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.670> bad<00:02:53.880> limit<00:02:54.300> switch

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
into play it's kind of bad limit switch

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.010 
into play it's kind of bad limit switch
and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.740> believe<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.300> one<00:02:57.570> right<00:02:57.840> up

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and I believe it is this one right up

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.970 
and I believe it is this one right up
here

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
here

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.880 
here
it's<00:02:59.520> either<00:02:59.700> adjustment<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:01.050> its<00:03:01.200> bed<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it's either adjustment for its bed and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.690 
it's either adjustment for its bed and
that's<00:03:02.430> what<00:03:02.730> causes<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.590> come<00:03:04.800> down<00:03:05.040> now

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
that's what causes this to come down now

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.410 
that's what causes this to come down now
we're<00:03:05.880> going<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.090> cycle<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.600> back<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.180> can

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
we're going to cycle it back so you can

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:25.280 
we're going to cycle it back so you can
see<00:03:15.600> everything<00:03:15.870> working

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.319 

you<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:25.920> see<00:03:26.189> this<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.819> fairly<00:03:27.150> new

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
you can see this is a fairly new

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.199 
you can see this is a fairly new
