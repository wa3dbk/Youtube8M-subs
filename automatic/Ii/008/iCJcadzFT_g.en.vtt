to<00:00:55.320> try<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.710> rid<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.730> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to try and get rid of it but it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
to try and get rid of it but it's
actually<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.989> fat<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> pelvic<00:00:59.730> tilt

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
actually not fat if it's a pelvic tilt

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.529 
actually not fat if it's a pelvic tilt
it's<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> pelvis<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.940> in<00:01:02.940> against

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it's actually the pelvis to in against

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
it's actually the pelvis to in against
the<00:01:03.660> abdominal<00:01:04.170> wall<00:01:04.339> effective<00:01:05.339> let's<00:01:05.519> say

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the abdominal wall effective let's say

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
the abdominal wall effective let's say
this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.000> pelvis<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.500> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
this is your pelvis that's what it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
this is your pelvis that's what it's
doing<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.010> tilting<00:01:08.520> forward<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> pushing

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
doing it's tilting forward and pushing

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.380 
doing it's tilting forward and pushing
that<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.119> draw<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that out so I'm just going to draw a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
that out so I'm just going to draw a
really<00:01:12.990> cool<00:01:13.260> diagram<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> want

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
really cool diagram for this and I want

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
really cool diagram for this and I want
to<00:01:14.700> show<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.439> correct

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
to show you how you can actually correct

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.429 
to show you how you can actually correct
this<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.970> simple<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.810> it's

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this it's really simple and it's

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.690 
this it's really simple and it's
something<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> I've<00:01:20.100> seen<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
something that I've seen a lot of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
something that I've seen a lot of
people's<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.509> years<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.320> doing

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
people's really for years you know doing

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
people's really for years you know doing
everything<00:01:23.430> eating<00:01:23.880> wise<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.270> work<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
everything eating wise to work on that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
everything eating wise to work on that
area<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.340> counted<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
area and it's just counted out to

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.660 
area and it's just counted out to
correcting<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> tilt<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
correcting the tilt so this is how the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.950 
correcting the tilt so this is how the
pelvis<00:01:30.090> looks<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:32.210> bit<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> bit

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
pelvis looks so a bit like that bit

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.249 
pelvis looks so a bit like that bit
like<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> book<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.640> yeah<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.049> effect<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
like a book it yeah and effect on the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.830 
like a book it yeah and effect on the
same<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.590> easier<00:01:38.180> say<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.240> say<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> your

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
same is easier say it say this is your

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.810 
same is easier say it say this is your
spine<00:01:40.170> which<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.619> fine<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> God<00:01:41.280> you've<00:01:42.150> got<00:01:42.509> an

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
spine which is fine of God you've got an

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.030 
spine which is fine of God you've got an
connective<00:01:44.820> tissue<00:01:45.570> pretty<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.170> that's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
connective tissue pretty much that's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
connective tissue pretty much that's
going<00:01:47.250> down<00:01:47.399> me<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.149> yeah

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
going down me like that yeah

quadricep region

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.240 
quadricep region
you<00:01:56.950> ache<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:58.900> a<00:01:58.930> horrendous<00:01:59.380> diagram

you ache this is a horrendous diagram
but<00:02:00.400> anyway<00:02:00.870> these<00:02:01.980> this<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.130> how<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.370> is<00:02:03.490> yeah

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
but anyway these this is how it is yeah

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.690 
but anyway these this is how it is yeah
see<00:02:04.840> if<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:07.350> palace<00:02:08.350> tilts<00:02:08.800> forward<00:02:09.070> us<00:02:09.490> an

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
see if the palace tilts forward us an

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.590 
see if the palace tilts forward us an
anterior<00:02:10.060> pelvic<00:02:10.240> tilt<00:02:11.010> what<00:02:12.010> happens<00:02:12.490> is<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
anterior pelvic tilt what happens is it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.470 
anterior pelvic tilt what happens is it
starts<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:14.910> basically<00:02:16.200> look<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.480> in

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
starts to basically look like that so in

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.780 
starts to basically look like that so in
other<00:02:19.600> words<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.610> area

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
other words this area

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.900 
other words this area
it<00:02:21.880> comes<00:02:22.150> short<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:24.070> area<00:02:24.550> becomes

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
it comes short and this area becomes

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.449 
it comes short and this area becomes
really<00:02:25.420> long<00:02:26.280> yep<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:28.590> effectively<00:02:29.590> what<00:02:30.070> we

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
really long yep and effectively what we

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.660 
really long yep and effectively what we
need<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.060> pull<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.450> back<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.370> say

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
need to do is pull it back so I can say

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.510 
need to do is pull it back so I can say
what<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.360> normal<00:02:34.959> alignment<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:36.340> like

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
what is in normal alignment it's like

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.020 
what is in normal alignment it's like
this<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.600> tilts<00:02:37.900> forward<00:02:39.030> different

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
this and it tilts forward different

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.750 
this and it tilts forward different
muscles<00:02:40.690> become<00:02:41.140> tight<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.400> you've<00:02:42.490> got<00:02:42.670> an

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
muscles become tight so if you've got an

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.520 
muscles become tight so if you've got an
anterior<00:02:43.060> pelvic<00:02:43.209> tilt<00:02:43.720> aware<00:02:43.990> just<00:02:44.230> to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
anterior pelvic tilt aware just to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
anterior pelvic tilt aware just to
notice<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.310> I'll<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:45.820> quickly<00:02:46.240> show

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
notice it because I'll just quickly show

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.650 
notice it because I'll just quickly show
you<00:02:47.070> hold<00:02:48.070> your<00:02:48.280> mallet<00:02:48.490> Eva<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:49.120> expect

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
you hold your mallet Eva I think expect

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.490 
you hold your mallet Eva I think expect
to<00:02:49.750> be<00:02:49.840> filming<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:52.140> pretty<00:02:53.140> much<00:02:53.320> this

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
to be filming this but pretty much this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.940 
to be filming this but pretty much this
is<00:02:53.560> how<00:02:53.830> an<00:02:54.330> anterior<00:02:55.330> pelvic<00:02:55.570> tilt<00:02:55.990> works<00:02:56.200> so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
is how an anterior pelvic tilt works so

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.640 
is how an anterior pelvic tilt works so
if<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.610> sort<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.540> bit<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.200> position

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
if you sort of a bit like that position

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.000 
if you sort of a bit like that position
as<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:02.380> butt<00:03:02.620> is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
as you can see you know the butt is

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.030 
as you can see you know the butt is
sticking<00:03:03.310> out<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.870> know<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.709> bit<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:05.950> a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
sticking out and you know the bit of a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.070 
sticking out and you know the bit of a
scourge<00:03:06.340> on<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.790> spine<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.690> would<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.930> I'll

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
scourge on the spine that would be I'll

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.420 
scourge on the spine that would be I'll
tell<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.320> about<00:03:08.410> -<00:03:08.709> obviously<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.190> would<00:03:09.340> be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
tell you about - obviously this would be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.150 
tell you about - obviously this would be
excessive<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.720> say<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.650> was<00:03:11.769> more<00:03:11.980> like

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
excessive but say if it was more like

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.130 
excessive but say if it was more like
this<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:13.209> know<00:03:13.300> that's<00:03:13.510> an<00:03:13.660> anterior<00:03:13.900> pelvic

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
this you know that's an anterior pelvic

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.500 
this you know that's an anterior pelvic
tilt<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.890> because<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.760> pelvis<00:03:16.150> like<00:03:16.300> say

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
tilt it's because of the pelvis like say

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.890 
tilt it's because of the pelvis like say
tilting<00:03:16.840> forward<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.980> causes<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:19.450> bottom

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
tilting forward and it causes the bottom

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.479 
tilting forward and it causes the bottom
of<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.140> student<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.680> say<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:20.980> stick<00:03:21.310> out

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
of the student like I say to stick out

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.580 
of the student like I say to stick out
and<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.360> reason<00:03:22.660> being<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:23.110> what<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:23.560> doing

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
and the reason being is what it's doing

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.080 
and the reason being is what it's doing
is<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.370> abdominals<00:03:24.790> are<00:03:25.180> now<00:03:25.360> links<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:27.090> also

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
is the abdominals are now links and also

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.720 
is the abdominals are now links and also
the<00:03:28.269> hamstrings<00:03:28.720> are<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.160> back<00:03:30.430> is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
the hamstrings are but the back is

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.930 
the hamstrings are but the back is
really<00:03:31.420> tight<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.110> so<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.220> hip<00:03:33.400> flexors

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
really tight and so is the hip flexors

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.660 
really tight and so is the hip flexors
and<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.150> cornerbacks<00:03:34.959> oil<00:03:35.200> region<00:03:35.650> EPS<00:03:36.489> of

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
and the cornerbacks oil region EPS of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.270 
and the cornerbacks oil region EPS of
this<00:03:36.940> area<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.570> this<00:03:37.660> area<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.110> tight<00:03:38.350> this

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
this area that this area is tight this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.790 
this area that this area is tight this
area<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.880> area

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
area this area

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.890 
area this area
oops<00:03:41.400> it's<00:03:41.760> because<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.420> say<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
oops it's because like I say the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.380 
oops it's because like I say the
imbalances<00:03:43.530> your<00:03:44.190> pelvis<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.790> tipped<00:03:45.030> forward

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
imbalances your pelvis is tipped forward

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.500 
imbalances your pelvis is tipped forward
like<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.740> muscle<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.310> tight<00:03:47.580> this

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
like that this muscle is tight this

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.640 
like that this muscle is tight this
muscle<00:03:49.020> is<00:03:49.260> now<00:03:49.620> looks<00:03:50.450> yeah<00:03:51.450> what<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.470> needed

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
muscle is now looks yeah what we needed

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.040 
muscle is now looks yeah what we needed
to<00:03:52.770> do<00:03:52.980> pull<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.580> back<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.150> then<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.450> sucks<00:03:54.750> in

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
to do pull it back and then it sucks in

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.530 
to do pull it back and then it sucks in
a<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:55.680> bit<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:55.950> fat<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.550> what<00:03:57.060> would<00:03:57.180> appear

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
a little bit of fat of what would appear

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.590 
a little bit of fat of what would appear
to<00:03:57.720> be<00:03:57.840> fat<00:03:58.050> at<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.860> bottom<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.280> stomach

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
to be fat at the bottom of the stomach

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.880 
to be fat at the bottom of the stomach
yep<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.900> it's<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.410> show<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.620> some

really cool exercise that you can do to

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.340 
really cool exercise that you can do to
reverse<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:05.150> first<00:04:06.150> one<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.630> basically<00:04:07.230> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
reverse this first one is basically a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.310 
reverse this first one is basically a
hip<00:04:07.560> bridge<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.610> I'm<00:04:09.600> just<00:04:09.900> going<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.110> give<00:04:10.260> you

you want to be holding this for about 30

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.190 
you want to be holding this for about 30
or<00:04:37.860> 40<00:04:37.950> seconds<00:04:38.730> most<00:04:39.390> people<00:04:39.840> want<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.020> do<00:04:40.110> in

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
the hip bridge go like this as you can

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.750 
the hip bridge go like this as you can
see<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.830> curving<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.370> back<00:04:44.550> you're

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
see it's curving the back you're

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.980 
see it's curving the back you're
actually<00:04:45.000> going<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.150> work<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.450> back<00:04:45.600> again

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
actually going to work the back again

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.830 
actually going to work the back again
and<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.740> aim<00:04:46.890> is<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.130> work<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.640> hamstrings<00:04:48.210> on

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
and the aim is to work the hamstrings on

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.159 
and the aim is to work the hamstrings on
this<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.800> wants<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.640> be<00:04:50.760> more<00:04:51.169> flat

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
this one so it wants to be more flat

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.260 
this one so it wants to be more flat
like<00:04:52.620> this<00:04:52.770> yet<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.700> hold<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.090> there<00:04:54.240> for

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
like this yet you hold it there for

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.170 
like this yet you hold it there for
about<00:04:54.510> 35<00:04:55.230> seconds<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.830> then<00:04:56.610> just<00:04:56.790> drop<00:04:57.000> down

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
about 35 seconds and then just drop down

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.340 
about 35 seconds and then just drop down
I'd<00:04:57.720> maybe<00:04:58.080> do<00:04:58.290> this<00:04:58.500> two<00:04:58.919> or<00:04:58.950> three<00:04:59.220> times<00:04:59.520> and

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
I'd maybe do this two or three times and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.850 
I'd maybe do this two or three times and
that's<00:05:01.350> going<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.650> work<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.810> hamstrings<00:05:03.860> yep

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
that's going to work the hamstrings yep

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.159 
that's going to work the hamstrings yep
next<00:05:05.280> one<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.790> can<00:05:06.000> do<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.510> split<00:05:06.990> one

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
next one that you can do is a split one

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.210 
next one that you can do is a split one
so<00:05:07.950> basically<00:05:08.520> in<00:05:09.419> this<00:05:09.570> position<00:05:09.960> just<00:05:10.919> going

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
so basically in this position just going

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.110 
so basically in this position just going
down<00:05:12.230> holding<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.350> there<00:05:13.560> for<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> second<00:05:14.850> or<00:05:14.970> so

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
down holding it there for a second or so

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.000 
down holding it there for a second or so
and<00:05:15.360> then<00:05:15.900> back<00:05:16.140> up<00:05:16.320> nice<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.590> slow

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
and then back up nice and slow

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.320 
and then back up nice and slow
and<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.070> just<00:05:19.280> doing<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:20.560> I'd<00:05:21.560> say<00:05:22.330> maybe

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
and you just doing this I'd say maybe

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.520 
and you just doing this I'd say maybe
just<00:05:24.070> 12<00:05:25.070> 15<00:05:25.580> times<00:05:25.850> on<00:05:26.030> each<00:05:26.120> leg<00:05:26.290> pretty<00:05:27.290> much

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
just 12 15 times on each leg pretty much

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.850 
just 12 15 times on each leg pretty much
how<00:05:27.800> many<00:05:28.160> times<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:28.700> feel<00:05:28.940> necessary<00:05:29.860> again

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
how many times you feel necessary again

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.410 
how many times you feel necessary again
just<00:05:31.010> repeat<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.370> couple<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:31.970> times<00:05:32.180> on<00:05:32.360> each

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
just repeat that couple of times on each

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.740 
just repeat that couple of times on each
leg<00:05:33.040> that<00:05:34.040> is<00:05:34.280> good<00:05:34.520> ass<00:05:34.640> up<00:05:34.850> again<00:05:35.210> work<00:05:35.540> in

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
leg that is good ass up again work in

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.720 
leg that is good ass up again work in
this<00:05:35.840> area<00:05:36.080> which<00:05:36.890> is<00:05:37.010> going<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:37.280> pull<00:05:37.550> that

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
this area which is going to pull that

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.140 
this area which is going to pull that
pelvis<00:05:38.180> back<00:05:38.830> so<00:05:39.830> remember<00:05:40.250> that<00:05:40.460> scenario

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
pelvis back so remember that scenario

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.760 
pelvis back so remember that scenario
that<00:05:41.420> you<00:05:41.510> saw<00:05:41.660> going<00:05:41.870> with<00:05:42.020> that<00:05:42.200> lower<00:05:42.470> level

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
that you saw going with that lower level

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.210 
that you saw going with that lower level
part<00:05:43.130> so<00:05:43.910> pretty<00:05:44.360> much<00:05:44.590> you<00:05:45.590> eat<00:05:45.770> in<00:05:45.980> well<00:05:46.190> II

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
part so pretty much you eat in well II

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.920 
part so pretty much you eat in well II
know<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:46.490> straining<00:05:46.940> well<00:05:47.060> everywhere<00:05:47.780> is

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
know you straining well everywhere is

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.570 
know you straining well everywhere is
fairly<00:05:48.320> but<00:05:48.860> you've<00:05:48.950> just<00:05:49.160> struggling<00:05:49.430> with

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
fairly but you've just struggling with

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.700 
fairly but you've just struggling with
that<00:05:49.700> little<00:05:50.090> bit<00:05:50.240> on<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:50.480> bottom<00:05:50.660> that<00:05:51.590> it's

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
that little bit on the bottom that it's

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.140 
that little bit on the bottom that it's
probably<00:05:51.950> because<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.580> pelvis<00:05:52.910> being

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
probably because of the pelvis being

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.510 
probably because of the pelvis being
tilted<00:05:53.360> there<00:05:54.260> too<00:05:54.500> or<00:05:54.710> some<00:05:54.920> exercises<00:05:55.400> to

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
tilted there too or some exercises to

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.730 
tilted there too or some exercises to
strengthen<00:05:55.730> this<00:05:56.000> area<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:57.230> other<00:05:57.410> exercise

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
strengthen this area the other exercise

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.980 
strengthen this area the other exercise

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
say having leg raises so you're hanging

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.040 
say having leg raises so you're hanging
on<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.380> bar<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:09.950> raising<00:06:10.460> your<00:06:10.850> legs<00:06:11.090> up

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
that's a real good exercise like I say

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.480 
that's a real good exercise like I say
I'm<00:06:14.780> itself<00:06:15.230> would<00:06:15.470> go<00:06:15.650> to<00:06:15.860> men<00:06:16.070> strengthen

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
I'm itself would go to men strengthen

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.880 
I'm itself would go to men strengthen
that<00:06:16.640> hamstring<00:06:17.180> area<00:06:17.390> to<00:06:17.840> be<00:06:17.930> honest<00:06:18.170> like<00:06:18.830> I

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
that hamstring area to be honest like I

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.510 
that hamstring area to be honest like I
say<00:06:19.130> quick<00:06:20.000> little<00:06:20.420> diagram<00:06:21.350> again<00:06:21.680> that's

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
say quick little diagram again that's

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.760 
say quick little diagram again that's
the<00:06:22.670> front<00:06:22.910> of<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.150> body<00:06:23.330> that's<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.590> bit

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
the front of the body that's the bit

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.280 
the front of the body that's the bit
that<00:06:24.800> stick<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:25.370> out<00:06:25.490> that's<00:06:26.420> because<00:06:26.840> the

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
that stick it out that's because the

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.850 
that stick it out that's because the
pelvis<00:06:27.830> has<00:06:28.760> tilted<00:06:29.120> forward<00:06:29.780> and<00:06:30.350> basically

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
pelvis has tilted forward and basically

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.620 
pelvis has tilted forward and basically
all<00:06:31.040> these<00:06:31.220> inner<00:06:31.430> internal<00:06:32.000> organs<00:06:32.390> in<00:06:32.480> here

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
all these inner internal organs in here

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.620 
all these inner internal organs in here
they're<00:06:33.230> sort<00:06:33.620> of<00:06:33.650> spilling<00:06:34.280> out<00:06:34.430> of<00:06:34.730> the<00:06:35.360> top

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
they're sort of spilling out of the top

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.810 
they're sort of spilling out of the top
and<00:06:35.870> pushing<00:06:36.740> against<00:06:37.040> that<00:06:37.310> I've<00:06:37.400> gone<00:06:37.580> on<00:06:37.760> a

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
and pushing against that I've gone on a

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.020 
and pushing against that I've gone on a
walk

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
walk

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.790 
walk
yep<00:06:39.260> get<00:06:39.950> this<00:06:40.220> to<00:06:40.580> go<00:06:40.760> back<00:06:41.470> to<00:06:42.470> how<00:06:42.620> it<00:06:42.770> should

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
yep get this to go back to how it should

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.980 
yep get this to go back to how it should
be<00:06:43.220> and<00:06:43.930> then<00:06:44.930> voila<00:06:46.210> stomach<00:06:47.210> becomes<00:06:47.630> flat

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
be and then voila stomach becomes flat

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.790 
be and then voila stomach becomes flat
again<00:06:48.700> so<00:06:49.700> that's<00:06:50.570> the<00:06:50.810> anterior<00:06:51.260> pelvic<00:06:51.410> tilt

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
again so that's the anterior pelvic tilt

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.460 
again so that's the anterior pelvic tilt
so<00:06:52.520> if<00:06:52.940> that's<00:06:53.090> we<00:06:53.330> struggling<00:06:53.570> with<00:06:53.870> work<00:06:54.290> on

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
so if that's we struggling with work on

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.470 
so if that's we struggling with work on
the<00:06:54.530> hamstrings<00:06:55.010> and<00:06:55.250> the<00:06:55.310> lower<00:06:56.090> sort<00:06:56.390> of

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
the hamstrings and the lower sort of

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.410 
the hamstrings and the lower sort of
abdominal<00:06:57.050> muscles<00:06:57.380> and<00:06:57.590> jobs<00:06:58.370> are<00:06:58.490> good<00:06:58.640> the

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
abdominal muscles and jobs are good the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.270 
abdominal muscles and jobs are good the
fat<00:06:59.930> I'll<00:07:00.200> just<00:07:00.380> quickly<00:07:00.590> tell<00:07:00.920> you<00:07:01.040> a<00:07:01.100> few

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.350 
that's good if you're driving all the
time<00:07:20.200> get<00:07:20.710> ups<00:07:20.890> another<00:07:21.160> way<00:07:21.340> that<00:07:21.370> really

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
time get ups another way that really

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.070 
time get ups another way that really
times<00:07:22.690> this<00:07:22.840> area<00:07:23.050> and<00:07:24.690> if<00:07:25.690> you've<00:07:25.930> been

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
times this area and if you've been

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.290 
times this area and if you've been
pregnant<00:07:26.350> you've<00:07:27.160> been<00:07:27.310> pregnant<00:07:27.550> again<00:07:27.850> but

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
pregnant you've been pregnant again but

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.150 
pregnant you've been pregnant again but
this<00:07:28.930> is<00:07:28.990> what<00:07:29.260> a<00:07:29.290> lot<00:07:29.530> of<00:07:29.560> women<00:07:29.710> who've<00:07:30.070> been

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 
this is what a lot of women who've been

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.280 
this is what a lot of women who've been
pregnant<00:07:30.610> tend<00:07:31.480> to<00:07:31.600> struggle<00:07:31.780> with<00:07:31.960> the<00:07:32.080> lower

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.290 
pregnant tend to struggle with the lower

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.690 
pregnant tend to struggle with the lower
part<00:07:32.620> I<00:07:32.800> think<00:07:33.040> because<00:07:33.160> they've<00:07:33.610> been

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.700 
part I think because they've been

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.330 
part I think because they've been
pregnant<00:07:33.940> that<00:07:34.720> that's<00:07:35.500> where<00:07:35.710> the<00:07:35.830> fast<00:07:36.040> sort

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 
pregnant that that's where the fast sort

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.060 
pregnant that that's where the fast sort
of<00:07:37.110> accumulated<00:07:38.110> that's<00:07:38.560> probably<00:07:38.950> about

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.070 
of accumulated that's probably about

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.270 
of accumulated that's probably about
active<00:07:39.520> also<00:07:40.480> wearing<00:07:40.810> high<00:07:40.960> heels<00:07:41.260> I<00:07:41.530> healed

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 
active also wearing high heels I healed

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.500 
active also wearing high heels I healed

all the time so you're up in that

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.510 
all the time so you're up in that
position<00:07:43.690> that<00:07:44.140> is<00:07:44.680> going<00:07:44.890> to<00:07:44.980> put<00:07:45.190> a<00:07:45.220> lot<00:07:45.430> of

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 
position that is going to put a lot of

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.200 
position that is going to put a lot of
tension<00:07:45.700> on<00:07:46.210> the<00:07:47.140> hip<00:07:47.830> flexors<00:07:48.280> and<00:07:48.550> like<00:07:49.090> to
