00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hey guys its victim raid and I've got

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.720 
hey guys its victim raid and I've got
the<00:00:02.970> ud7<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:04.190> was<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.460> push<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.120> 4.5

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
the ud7 I was going to push it to 4.5

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.009 
the ud7 I was going to push it to 4.5
just<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.849> can<00:00:08.970> get<00:00:09.240> my<00:00:09.650> cpu<00:00:10.650> z<00:00:11.809> validator<00:00:12.809> by

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
just so I can get my cpu z validator by

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.470 
just so I can get my cpu z validator by
and<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.460> set<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.759> 4.5

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and as you can see I have it set to 4.5

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.070 
and as you can see I have it set to 4.5
at<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> 45<00:00:16.470> multiplier

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.910 

but<00:00:20.540> with<00:00:21.540> them<00:00:21.720> i'm<00:00:21.930> running<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.350> f8<00:00:23.010> bios

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
but with them i'm running the f8 bios

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.570 
but with them i'm running the f8 bios
when<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.950> go<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.150> operating<00:00:27.509> system<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
when I go into the operating system and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.659 
when I go into the operating system and
it<00:00:29.580> also<00:00:29.730> says<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.119> here<00:00:30.360> at<00:00:30.590> 4.2<00:00:31.590> even<00:00:32.580> though

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it also says it here at 4.2 even though

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.840 
it also says it here at 4.2 even though
i<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> set<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.720> 4.5<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.950> think<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
i have it set to 4.5 i think that that

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.030 
i have it set to 4.5 i think that that
is<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.530> f8<00:00:37.530> bios<00:00:38.150> like<00:00:39.150> are<00:00:39.949> limiting<00:00:40.949> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
is the f8 bios like are limiting the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.070 
is the f8 bios like are limiting the
overclock<00:00:41.460> i<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.940> which<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> probably

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
overclock i can get which is probably

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.229 
overclock i can get which is probably
good<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.489> explode

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
good because i don't want to explode

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
good because i don't want to explode
like<00:00:45.600> love<00:00:45.809> code<00:00:46.050> edit<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.550> i<00:00:47.580> do<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.850> his

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
like love code edit but i do think his

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
like love code edit but i do think his
was<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.900> a<00:00:49.140> default<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> board

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
was because of a default in the board

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549 
was because of a default in the board
like<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.089> defect<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.140> i<00:00:52.199> might<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.500> have

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
like a a defect but i might not have

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
like a a defect but i might not have
been<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:54.059> might<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.540> they're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
been and this might be what they're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.710 
been and this might be what they're
fixing<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.229> their<00:00:55.379> fate<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.129> yeah<00:00:58.460> 4.2<00:00:59.720> when

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
fixing with their fate so yeah 4.2 when

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.770 
fixing with their fate so yeah 4.2 when
the<00:01:01.080> by<00:01:01.769> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.610> advanced<00:01:03.180> frequency

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the by going to the advanced frequency

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.640 
the by going to the advanced frequency
you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.820> set<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
you can see that I've got it set to the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.960 
you can see that I've got it set to the
45<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.159> might<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.460> able<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
45 you might not be able to see it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.570 
45 you might not be able to see it
because<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.360> bright<00:01:09.600> bit<00:01:09.869> 45<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because it's bit bright bit 45 and it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.170 
because it's bit bright bit 45 and it
says<00:01:11.760> 4.5<00:01:12.270> gigahertz<00:01:12.780> right<00:01:13.170> there<00:01:14.000> but<00:01:15.000> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
says 4.5 gigahertz right there but it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.920 
says 4.5 gigahertz right there but it's
not<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.750> 4.2<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.760> I'll<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.450> boot

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
not it's 4.2 so I'll just go boot

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.080 
not it's 4.2 so I'll just go boot
windows<00:01:19.310> so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.849 

and<00:01:25.630> I'll<00:01:25.750> show<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:25.960> what<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:26.259> says<00:01:26.409> in<00:01:26.530> CP

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
and I'll show you what it says in CP

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.240 
and I'll show you what it says in CP
easy

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 

so<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.090> bear<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.300> me<00:01:30.510> for<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.720> second<00:01:31.080> while

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so just bear with me for a second while

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
so just bear with me for a second while
it<00:01:31.320> boots<00:01:31.490> shouldn't<00:01:32.490> take<00:01:32.640> too<00:01:32.670> long<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.120> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it boots shouldn't take too long on the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.930 
it boots shouldn't take too long on the
m4<00:01:33.920> but<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.130> noticed<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.730> bias

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
m4 but I have noticed that the bias

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.690 
m4 but I have noticed that the bias
takes<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.480> little<00:01:36.660> wilder<00:01:37.100> closed<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.400> since

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
takes a little wilder closed with since

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:54.190 
takes a little wilder closed with since
I<00:01:38.790> got<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> fate

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.490 

and<00:01:54.380> as<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.039> can<00:01:55.189> see<00:01:55.219> I<00:01:55.399> haven't<00:01:55.729> caught<00:01:56.000> fire

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
and as you can see I haven't caught fire

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.770 
and as you can see I haven't caught fire
it's<00:01:57.500> running<00:01:57.860> beautifully<00:01:58.130> oh<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.450> shouldn't

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
it's running beautifully oh I shouldn't

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.060 
it's running beautifully oh I shouldn't
turn<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.079> sideways<00:02:00.259> it's<00:02:00.619> not<00:02:00.740> going<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.979> work

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
turn it sideways it's not going to work

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.450 
turn it sideways it's not going to work
like<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.369> on<00:02:01.670> YouTube<00:02:02.560> yes<00:02:03.560> there<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.039> is<00:02:04.100> and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
like that on YouTube yes there it is and

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.290 
like that on YouTube yes there it is and
I<00:02:04.520> haven't<00:02:04.880> exploded

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.150 

so<00:02:08.960> I'll<00:02:09.140> load<00:02:09.320> up<00:02:09.530> cpu-z<00:02:11.620> it's<00:02:12.620> not<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
so I'll load up cpu-z it's not on the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.770 
so I'll load up cpu-z it's not on the
solid-state<00:02:13.940> some<00:02:14.210> might<00:02:14.360> take<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> little

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
solid-state some might take a little

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.080 
solid-state some might take a little
while

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.410 

yet<00:02:20.090> now<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.510> therefore<00:02:20.750> point2<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.300> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
yet now it is therefore point2 and it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.230 
yet now it is therefore point2 and it
says<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.810> multiplier<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.500> x<00:02:24.950> 42<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
says the multiplier is x 42 when in the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.110 
says the multiplier is x 42 when in the
bias<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.750> set<00:02:26.960> at<00:02:27.110> x<00:02:27.320> 45<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.790> yeah<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:28.970> think

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
bias is set at x 45 so yeah I think

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.500 
bias is set at x 45 so yeah I think
that's<00:02:29.570> an<00:02:29.720> issue<00:02:29.830> with<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.070> f8<00:02:31.520> bias<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:34.070> yet

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
that's an issue with the f8 bias and yet

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.130 
that's an issue with the f8 bias and yet
that's<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.750> was<00:02:35.990> going<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:37.150> say<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.480> will<00:02:38.960> do

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
that's all I was going to say I will do

another<00:02:47.750> one

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.940 

oh<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.519> know<00:03:07.790> another<00:03:08.000> thing<00:03:08.090> with<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.450> f8<00:03:08.950> see

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
oh I know another thing with the f8 see

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.839 
oh I know another thing with the f8 see
my<00:03:10.099> mouse<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.849> way<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:13.580> moves

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
my mouse is that way but it moves

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.300 
my mouse is that way but it moves
sideways<00:03:14.209> when<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.900> move<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.230> up<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.680> down<00:03:15.769> and

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
sideways when I move it up and down and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.180 
sideways when I move it up and down and
left<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.760> right<00:03:16.970> goes<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.680> correct<00:03:18.980> way<00:03:19.159> and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
left and right goes the correct way and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.350 
left and right goes the correct way and
up<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.610> down<00:03:19.700> also<00:03:20.120> goes<00:03:20.330> like<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.980> yeah

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
up and down also goes like that so yeah

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.210 
up and down also goes like that so yeah
my<00:03:23.360> mouse<00:03:23.540> doesn't<00:03:23.810> quite<00:03:24.170> work<00:03:24.230> properly<00:03:24.890> in

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
my mouse doesn't quite work properly in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.350 
my mouse doesn't quite work properly in
the<00:03:25.250> f8<00:03:26.739> every<00:03:27.739> time<00:03:27.890> it's<00:03:28.099> different

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.690 

ah<00:03:33.040> Shh

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.820 

load<00:03:38.330> optimized<00:03:38.810> defaults<00:03:39.110> because<00:03:39.650> there's

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
load optimized defaults because there's

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.520 
load optimized defaults because there's
no<00:03:39.980> load<00:03:40.760> default<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.420> only<00:03:41.720> load<00:03:41.989> optimized

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
no load default is only load optimized

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.960 
no load default is only load optimized
defaults<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.260> might<00:03:45.530> need<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:46.010> fix<00:03:46.610> my

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
defaults so I might need to fix my

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:55.360 
defaults so I might need to fix my
memory<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:48.879> don't<00:03:49.879> know<00:03:49.940> actually

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.320

vanced memory dream memory profile one

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.080 
vanced memory dream memory profile one
that's<00:04:02.690> what<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:02.840> want<00:04:05.049> because<00:04:06.049> my<00:04:06.790> FA<00:04:07.790> Tobias

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
that's what I want because my FA Tobias

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.160 
that's what I want because my FA Tobias
also<00:04:08.629> detects<00:04:08.989> my<00:04:09.549> 2133<00:04:10.549> ram<00:04:10.790> as<00:04:11.090> 1600<00:04:12.079> as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
also detects my 2133 ram as 1600 as

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.750 
also detects my 2133 ram as 1600 as
we'll<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.409> to<00:04:12.530> put<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.769> in<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.159> extreme

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
we'll have to put it in the extreme

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160 
we'll have to put it in the extreme
memory<00:04:14.299> profile<00:04:14.659> to<00:04:14.780> get<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.019> work

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
memory profile to get it to work

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.759 
memory profile to get it to work
properly<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:18.079> here<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.820> floating<00:04:19.820> back<00:04:20.239> up

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
properly but here it is floating back up

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.379 
properly but here it is floating back up
with<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.919> default<00:04:22.310> settings<00:04:22.669> after<00:04:22.820> having

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
with the default settings after having

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.189 
with the default settings after having
overclocked<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:25.780> think<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:26.900> going<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> do

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
overclocked it I think it's going to do

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.170 
overclocked it I think it's going to do
the<00:04:27.350> dual<00:04:27.830> post<00:04:28.160> thing<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.550> does<00:04:28.880> sometimes

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
the dual post thing it does sometimes

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.000 
the dual post thing it does sometimes
with<00:04:29.479> f8<00:04:29.780> as<00:04:29.990> well<00:04:30.229> it's<00:04:30.530> another<00:04:30.740> thing<00:04:30.949> i

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
with f8 as well it's another thing i

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.080 
with f8 as well it's another thing i
don't<00:04:31.070> like<00:04:31.190> about<00:04:32.169> f8c<00:04:33.169> it<00:04:33.289> loads<00:04:33.470> there

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:52.430 

flat<00:04:37.780> screen<00:04:38.340> twice

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440

and here we are back in Windows I
haven't<00:04:56.100> caught<00:04:56.490> fire<00:04:56.790> so<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:58.970> don't<00:04:59.970> think

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
haven't caught fire so I don't think

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120 
haven't caught fire so I don't think
there's<00:05:00.630> an<00:05:00.780> issue<00:05:00.900> with<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.290> ud<00:05:01.530> sevens<00:05:01.950> I

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.160 
there's an issue with the ud sevens I
think<00:05:02.850> glove<00:05:03.300> ko's<00:05:03.540> was<00:05:04.310> defective<00:05:06.050> but<00:05:07.050> we'll

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
think glove ko's was defective but we'll

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.680 
think glove ko's was defective but we'll
see<00:05:07.320> how<00:05:07.500> he<00:05:07.530> goes<00:05:07.680> with<00:05:08.340> his<00:05:08.370> RM<00:05:09.240> aid<00:05:09.390> board

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
see how he goes with his RM aid board

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.440 
see how he goes with his RM aid board
when<00:05:10.380> he<00:05:10.410> gets<00:05:10.640> I'd<00:05:11.640> say<00:05:11.910> they'll<00:05:12.090> send<00:05:12.300> him<00:05:12.390> a

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
when he gets I'd say they'll send him a

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.730 
when he gets I'd say they'll send him a
new<00:05:12.570> one<00:05:12.600> they<00:05:12.840> were<00:05:12.900> bomb<00:05:13.440> repair<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.210> but

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
new one they were bomb repair it but

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.090 
new one they were bomb repair it but
that<00:05:16.740> could<00:05:17.010> well<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.580> says<00:05:17.730> 1.2<00:05:18.330> but<00:05:18.920> if<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:20.040> do

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
that could well it says 1.2 but if I do

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.860 
that could well it says 1.2 but if I do
anything<00:05:20.370> strenuous<00:05:20.670> it'll<00:05:21.120> boost<00:05:21.420> back<00:05:21.690> up

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
anything strenuous it'll boost back up

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.540 
anything strenuous it'll boost back up
to<00:05:22.940> 3.5<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.240> thinking<00:05:24.630> does<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.140> don't<00:05:25.830> know<00:05:25.920> but

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
to 3.5 I thinking does I don't know but

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.180 
to 3.5 I thinking does I don't know but
yeah<00:05:27.320> there<00:05:28.320> we<00:05:28.410> go<00:05:28.440> that's<00:05:28.710> all<00:05:28.890> I'm<00:05:29.010> going<00:05:29.130> to

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.680 
yeah there we go that's all I'm going to
say<00:05:29.760> in<00:05:30.270> this<00:05:30.330> video<00:05:30.600> thanks<00:05:31.530> for<00:05:31.590> watching
