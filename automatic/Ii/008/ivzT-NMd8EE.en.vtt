00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
game play is patrol this one building

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
game play is patrol this one building
which<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.090> area<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which is this area right here the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.570 
which is this area right here the
straight<00:01:04.080> narrow<00:01:04.110> path<00:01:04.589> away<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.460> other

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
straight narrow path away in the other

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.920 
straight narrow path away in the other
entrance<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> mob

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
entrance and that's how we get this mob

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
entrance and that's how we get this mob
on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> map<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> best<00:01:08.430> way

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
on the map I think this is the best way

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
on the map I think this is the best way
to<00:01:08.760> play<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.180> lockdown<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.260> map<00:01:10.439> isn't

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
to play on lockdown and this map isn't
as<00:01:10.830> bad<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.340> thought<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.549> was<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
as bad as I thought it was when this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030 
as bad as I thought it was when this

now i think it's still going on and that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.450 
now i think it's still going on and that
is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.689> juggernaut<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.649> gun<00:01:55.890> show<00:01:56.070> series

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
basically what that is is getting

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
basically what that is is getting
assault<00:01:58.649> juggernaut<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.640> every<00:02:00.119> single
