00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
heard that the pc version had even more

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.369 
heard that the pc version had even more
stuff<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> did<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.570> pc<00:01:00.960> about

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
stuff so I did get it for my pc about

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
stuff so I did get it for my pc about
three<00:01:01.680> months<00:01:01.770> afterwards<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.059> liked<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
three months afterwards and I liked that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
three months afterwards and I liked that
too<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.229> much<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.409> stuff

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
too because there was so much more stuff

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
too because there was so much more stuff
but<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.939> never<00:01:06.780> played<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.350> much<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
but I never played it as much as the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
but I never played it as much as the
xbox<00:01:08.130> version<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.970> prefer

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
xbox version just because I prefer

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
xbox version just because I prefer
console<00:01:09.810> gaming<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.560> pc<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.340> bad

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
console gaming and my pc is really bad

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
console gaming and my pc is really bad
so<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.090> difficult<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.720> me<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> do

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so it's pretty difficult for me to do

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.320 
so it's pretty difficult for me to do
that<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.860> finally<00:01:14.220> uh<00:01:14.430> took<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that but I finally uh took the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
that but I finally uh took the
initiative<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.740> youtube<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.340> find<00:01:17.580> a

plugins<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.350> game<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.829> great<00:01:32.009> how<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.579> but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
plugins the game is great how it is but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260 
plugins the game is great how it is but
what<00:01:33.450> amazed<00:01:34.259> me<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> most<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.490> size<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
what amazed me the most was the size of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
what amazed me the most was the size of
the<00:01:36.450> worlds<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> pc<00:01:37.560> version<00:01:37.590> i<00:01:38.040> don't

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the worlds on the pc version i don't

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
the worlds on the pc version i don't
even<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.790> find<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> end<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
even think you can find the end of it it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.550 
even think you can find the end of it it
just<00:01:40.590> goes<00:01:40.710> forever<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.490> ever<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.909> ever<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
just goes forever and ever and ever and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.109 
just goes forever and ever and ever and
the<00:01:43.560> other<00:01:43.710> thing<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.670> amount<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> people

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the other thing was the amount of people

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
the other thing was the amount of people
you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.020> server<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.740> there

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you can have in a server I think there

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
you can have in a server I think there
were<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.310> than<00:01:47.490> 42<00:01:48.030> people<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.570> server

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
were more than 42 people in the server

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.690 
were more than 42 people in the server
at<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.229> time<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.399> blown<00:01:50.579> away

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
at one time I was just blown away

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
at one time I was just blown away
because<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.840> much<00:01:52.110> fun<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.740> were

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
because that was so much fun there were
so<00:01:52.979> many<00:01:53.070> people<00:01:53.189> running<00:01:53.729> around<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.990> it

really<00:02:49.290> need<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> do<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.159> add<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.790> you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
really need to do is add in so that you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690 
really need to do is add in so that you
have<00:02:51.150> more<00:02:51.480> people<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.959> server<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:53.340> know

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
have more people in the server I know

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.210 
have more people in the server I know
it's<00:02:53.879> not<00:02:54.000> exactly<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.720> same<00:02:54.930> thing<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:56.159> a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it's not exactly the same thing but a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.369 
it's not exactly the same thing but a
call<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.299> up<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.480> 16<00:02:58.079> and

call of you you can have up to 16 and
halo<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.709> could<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.010> more<00:02:59.280> than<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.700> in<00:03:00.000> a

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
halo you could have more than that in a

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.449 
halo you could have more than that in a
server<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> know<00:03:01.319> it's<00:03:01.500> not<00:03:01.590> impossible<00:03:01.950> on

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
server so I know it's not impossible on

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.339 
server so I know it's not impossible on
the<00:03:02.549> xbox<00:03:02.909> 360<00:03:03.450> even<00:03:03.720> though<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.019> bit

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.860 
the xbox 360 even though it is a bit
smaller<00:03:04.859> than<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:06.120> stuff<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.629> do<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
smaller than the stuff you can do in the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.520 
smaller than the stuff you can do in the
PC<00:03:07.290> obviously<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.120> same<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.659> map<00:03:10.170> size

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
PC obviously and same with the map size

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.220 
PC obviously and same with the map size
they<00:03:11.280> don't<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.639> to<00:03:11.849> make<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.239> endless<00:03:12.900> like

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
they don't have to make it endless like

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.289 
they don't have to make it endless like
the<00:03:13.500> computer<00:03:14.400> version<00:03:14.819> even<00:03:14.970> though<00:03:15.120> that

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
the computer version even though that

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.000 
the computer version even though that
would<00:03:15.419> be<00:03:15.540> amazing<00:03:15.780> even<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.739> they<00:03:16.829> just

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
would be amazing even if they just

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.610 
would be amazing even if they just
expanded<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.699> by<00:03:17.849> four<00:03:18.329> sizes<00:03:18.540> because<00:03:18.900> on

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
expanded it by four sizes because on

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.530 
expanded it by four sizes because on
xbox<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.310> start<00:03:20.549> up<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.760> server<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.299> then<00:03:21.389> you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
xbox you start up a server and then you

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.520 
xbox you start up a server and then you
basically<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.049> entire<00:03:22.319> world

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
basically have the entire world

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.349 
basically have the entire world
discovered<00:03:23.129> within<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.609> an<00:03:23.790> hour<00:03:23.940> or<00:03:24.090> two

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
discovered within like an hour or two

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.569 
discovered within like an hour or two
and<00:03:24.569> it's<00:03:25.349> just<00:03:25.500> boring<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.040> found<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
and it's just boring you found all the

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.039 
and it's just boring you found all the
strongholds<00:03:27.180> found<00:03:27.389> whatever<00:03:27.629> there<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
strongholds found whatever there is to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.129 
strongholds found whatever there is to
find<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.500> note<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.660> breviary<00:03:30.660> map<00:03:30.870> that

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
find a note and the breviary map that

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.809 
find a note and the breviary map that
you<00:03:31.230> play<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:31.980> play<00:03:32.160> them<00:03:32.280> over<00:03:32.459> and

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
you play and then you play them over and

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.839 
you play and then you play them over and
over<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.419> then<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.680> playability<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.579> it

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
over and then the just playability of it

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.780 
over and then the just playability of it
goes<00:03:36.030> down<00:03:36.389> with<00:03:36.870> how<00:03:37.109> many<00:03:37.250> maps<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.579> make

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
goes down with how many maps you make

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
goes down with how many maps you make
like<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.419> because<00:03:39.660> they<00:03:39.930> don't<00:03:40.109> last<00:03:40.290> very

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
like that because they don't last very

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.140 
like that because they don't last very
long<00:03:40.739> because<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.220> find<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:41.609> all<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:42.000> it

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
long because you find it all and then it

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.939 
long because you find it all and then it
just<00:03:42.299> gets<00:03:42.419> born<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.139> if<00:03:43.620> they<00:03:43.799> could

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
just gets born like that if they could

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.650 
just gets born like that if they could
expand<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.519> world<00:03:44.730> sighs<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.209> think<00:03:45.419> that<00:03:45.540> it

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
expand the world sighs I think that it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.509 
expand the world sighs I think that it
would<00:03:45.780> make<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> game<00:03:46.829> even<00:03:47.040> better<00:03:47.340> of

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
would make the game even better of

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.009 
would make the game even better of
course<00:03:47.669> if<00:03:48.000> they<00:03:48.150> could<00:03:48.269> have<00:03:48.329> more<00:03:48.540> people<00:03:48.780> in

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
course if they could have more people in

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.399 
course if they could have more people in
a<00:03:49.139> lobby<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.769> um<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.810> gets<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.199> really

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
a lobby and um I know it gets a really

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.470 
a lobby and um I know it gets a really
laggy<00:03:52.799> tho<00:03:52.980> i<00:03:53.370> guess<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:54.090> would<00:03:54.299> be<00:03:54.449> a

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
laggy tho i guess that would be a

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720 
laggy tho i guess that would be a
problem<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.859> they<00:03:56.040> could<00:03:56.220> find<00:03:56.250> out<00:03:56.609> how

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
problem but if they could find out how

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.640 
problem but if they could find out how
to<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:57.659> they<00:03:57.840> could<00:03:58.049> do<00:03:58.169> these<00:03:58.349> things

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
to do this if they could do these things

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.619 
to do this if they could do these things
with<00:03:58.980> more<00:03:59.489> than<00:03:59.669> eight<00:03:59.849> people<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.389> lobby

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
with more than eight people in the lobby

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.949 
with more than eight people in the lobby
bigger<00:04:01.319> worlds<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:01.980> possibly<00:04:02.790> even<00:04:02.959> 24-7

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
bigger worlds and possibly even 24-7

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.860 
bigger worlds and possibly even 24-7
servers<00:04:04.379> that<00:04:04.590> would<00:04:04.769> be<00:04:04.919> incredible<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:06.180> think

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
servers that would be incredible I think

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.740 
servers that would be incredible I think
that<00:04:07.079> minecraft<00:04:07.889> xbox<00:04:08.400> 360<00:04:08.879> would<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.269> topping

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
that minecraft xbox 360 would be topping

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.319 
that minecraft xbox 360 would be topping
all<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.109> other<00:04:10.260> games<00:04:10.500> possibly<00:04:11.280> even<00:04:11.370> not

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
all the other games possibly even not

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.479 
all the other games possibly even not
just<00:04:12.540> arcade<00:04:12.930> games<00:04:13.260> because<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.220> things

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
just arcade games because the things

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.940 
just arcade games because the things
that<00:04:14.760> really<00:04:14.909> bring<00:04:15.299> xbox<00:04:15.599> 360's<00:04:16.409> down<00:04:16.620> is

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that really bring xbox 360's down is

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.479 
that really bring xbox 360's down is
those<00:04:17.219> three<00:04:17.669> things<00:04:17.880> that

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
those three things that

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.800 
those three things that
world<00:04:18.729> isn't<00:04:19.000> big<00:04:19.239> enough<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:19.569> it<00:04:19.690> gets

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
world isn't big enough and it gets

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.140 
world isn't big enough and it gets
boring<00:04:20.079> fast<00:04:20.229> not<00:04:21.220> even<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.699> is<00:04:21.849> behind

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
boring fast not even that it is behind

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.770 
boring fast not even that it is behind
and<00:04:22.569> updates<00:04:23.020> but<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:24.220> fact<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:25.330> map<00:04:25.599> is

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
and updates but the fact that the map is

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.379 
and updates but the fact that the map is
so<00:04:25.990> small<00:04:26.349> so<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.130> don't<00:04:27.910> know<00:04:28.000> those<00:04:28.150> are<00:04:28.270> just

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
so small so I don't know those are just

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.260 
so small so I don't know those are just

or<00:04:43.680> sort<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.740> show<00:04:44.889> everyone<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.310> that's

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
or sort of show everyone that that's

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.629 
or sort of show everyone that that's
what<00:04:46.509> I<00:04:46.539> think<00:04:46.720> really<00:04:47.080> brings<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.500> xbox<00:04:48.160> 360

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
what I think really brings the xbox 360

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.980 
what I think really brings the xbox 360
edition<00:04:48.789> down<00:04:49.210> if<00:04:49.389> anything<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.840> that's

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
edition down if anything and that's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.580 
edition down if anything and that's
definitely<00:04:50.289> what<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:51.190> needs<00:04:51.750> in<00:04:52.750> my<00:04:52.930> opinion<00:04:53.229> I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
definitely what it needs in my opinion I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.710 
definitely what it needs in my opinion I
know<00:04:53.650> some<00:04:54.250> people<00:04:54.280> may<00:04:54.789> disagree<00:04:54.970> but<00:04:55.389> when

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
know some people may disagree but when

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.480 
know some people may disagree but when
you<00:04:55.810> think<00:04:55.960> about<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.409> like<00:04:57.009> only<00:04:57.280> eight

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
you think about it like only eight

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.020 
you think about it like only eight
people<00:04:57.669> in<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.090> lobby<00:04:58.330> um<00:04:59.580> that's<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:00.789> lot<00:05:01.000> of

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
people in a lobby um that's a lot of

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.249 
people in a lobby um that's a lot of
people<00:05:01.449> and<00:05:01.569> it's<00:05:01.690> not<00:05:01.870> like<00:05:01.960> you'd<00:05:02.110> be

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
people and it's not like you'd be

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.110 
people and it's not like you'd be
playing<00:05:02.470> with<00:05:02.650> more<00:05:02.889> friends<00:05:03.490> you're<00:05:03.909> only

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
playing with more friends you're only

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.760 
playing with more friends you're only
allowed<00:05:04.300> at<00:05:04.509> eight<00:05:04.690> people<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.080> party<00:05:05.259> anyways

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
allowed at eight people a party anyways

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.649 
allowed at eight people a party anyways
but<00:05:06.310> then<00:05:06.430> if<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.639> add<00:05:06.669> it<00:05:06.880> not<00:05:07.120> an<00:05:07.300> invite
