00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 by the staff 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 only that a person can not kill the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.270
 bike is good for maintenance that stays in a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 very large space there access to motorcycle 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.450
 but a person can not lift and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 two people suffer to lift the bike 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:50.039
 then a dap serving rack serves more 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.999

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.479
 of the procedure as seen 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:16.530
 original tire original 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:18.860
 bike and so on will not go right way 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 we will see 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.350

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.080
 a weaver know who is going the most 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.190
 height that original tire stays the fabric 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.190
 no chance 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:59.710
 without logic is a good option if the board 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.090
 This is all very loud. 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.649
 There you have to have one more time. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.800
 school a man to help raise 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.450
