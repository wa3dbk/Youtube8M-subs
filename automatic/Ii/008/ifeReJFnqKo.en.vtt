00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 here is the medium that brings my 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.809
 highlights of 3 and beginning with the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.560
 bethesda conference that a Sunday and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.640
 had the gameplay of felt 4 guy I like 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 too much 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.859
 I really liked what I saw is there 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.140
 How do you create the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.529
 your character the variations 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.260
 guy I find very well done beyond what 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 I really liked the graphics. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.360
 overall it is very good to have seen in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 very mimi and I think it 's cool 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.899
 I liked it enough to show a little 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.719
 of the same gameplay m pure play coming back 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.270
 environment seems to be gigantic 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.010
 and you could see that the effects of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.780
 light are very good 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.199
 quite different from what we can 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 can remembered fallout 3 that honestly 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.020
 the graphics are really poor is really 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.220
 For the time we have there the character 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.010
 you created at the beginning of this video and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 there is not much better handling 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.900
 there you find the dog that is going to be 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 your ally your colleague and your 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.590
 journey here I really liked it and I think 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.659
 it will be very cool this approach together 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 with the animals is to help you 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.290
 It's very cool, the system is back . 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 return 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 It's going to have and I really like this too. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.110
 system and more so I think the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 action and ill will be very fucking I 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.619
 enjoy too much though next highlight 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.820
 that it is from a guy's return to the origins of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.579
 of 1 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.960
 is not of 14 is looks like a kind of 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 reboot of the one series I really liked the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 I've seen it looks like classic shutter 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.689
 It's a thousand thing already celebrated. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.570
 you get to the map and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.649
 fun kill monster and have several 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.899
 styles of how to kill if you have until 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.810
 through a military scheme and ripping the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.430
 crazy country foundation you do is fine 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.349
 bloodshed has mutilation and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.569

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.519
