can't<00:00:00.329> see<00:00:00.570> it<00:00:00.659> there<00:00:00.900> we<00:00:00.989> go<00:00:02.300> see<00:00:03.300> what

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
can't see it there we go see what

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.999 
can't see it there we go see what
happens<00:00:03.659> if<00:00:03.750> i<00:00:03.810> create<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.140> face<00:00:04.350> right<00:00:04.620> here<00:00:04.770> is

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
happens if i create a face right here is

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.880 
happens if i create a face right here is
it'll<00:00:05.220> let<00:00:05.370> me<00:00:05.520> know<00:00:05.970> i<00:00:06.210> think<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:06.890> let's

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
it'll let me know i think so let's

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.490 
it'll let me know i think so let's
smooth<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:10.309> there<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:11.460> go<00:00:11.870> and<00:00:12.870> then<00:00:13.349> let's

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
smooth that there we go and then let's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.099 
smooth that there we go and then let's
create<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.799> face<00:00:13.950> right<00:00:14.160> here<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:15.080> reserve<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
create a face right here I reserve the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
create a face right here I reserve the
right<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.619> change<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.279> topology<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:18.240> any

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
right to change this topology at any

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.750 
right to change this topology at any
time<00:00:22.340> okay<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.590> we've<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.099> basics<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.699> our

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
time okay so we've got the basics of our

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
time okay so we've got the basics of our
nose<00:00:27.019> some<00:00:28.019> basic<00:00:28.380> eyes<00:00:30.619> not<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> worry

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
nose some basic eyes not going to worry

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.299 
nose some basic eyes not going to worry
too<00:00:32.369> much<00:00:32.579> about<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.149> ear<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.480> yet<00:00:34.309> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
too much about the ear just yet that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.200 
too much about the ear just yet that
another<00:00:35.550> division<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:37.370> here<00:00:38.370> no<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.000> not

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
another division right here no it's not

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.139 
another division right here no it's not
because<00:00:39.390> something<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.320> wrong<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.649> there

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.520 

haha<00:00:45.770> swell<00:00:46.770> those<00:00:46.980> vertices<00:00:48.530> actually

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
haha swell those vertices actually

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
haha swell those vertices actually
that's<00:00:49.680> undo<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:52.250> I'm<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that's undo that I'm just going to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
that's undo that I'm just going to
select<00:00:53.670> all<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.680> remove<00:00:55.680> doubles<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
select all and remove doubles that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.240 
select all and remove doubles that
basically<00:00:56.719> removes<00:00:57.719> any<00:00:57.899> two<00:00:58.410> vertexes<00:00:59.010> or

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
basically removes any two vertexes or

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000 
basically removes any two vertexes or
more<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.760> are<00:01:00.059> within<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.629> threshold<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
more that are within this threshold and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.969 
more that are within this threshold and
it<00:01:02.550> removed<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.860> changes<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it removed it you can see changes it to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
it removed it you can see changes it to
a<00:01:05.100> deselected<00:01:05.700> edge<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:09.080> divide

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
a deselected edge so now we can divide

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.080 
a deselected edge so now we can divide
that<00:01:12.140> let's<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> front

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.510 

just<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:17.690> can<00:01:17.840> take<00:01:18.230> that<00:01:18.260> in<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.620> little<00:01:18.830> bit<00:01:18.980> we

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
just we can take that in a little bit we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.020 
just we can take that in a little bit we
don't<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:22.780> take<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.840> one<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.940> but<00:01:25.940> we

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
don't have to take that one in but we

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:58.970 
don't have to take that one in but we
don't<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.270> to

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.820 

get<00:01:59.980> a<00:02:00.010> little<00:02:00.340> bit<00:02:00.460> carried<00:02:00.790> away<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:02.470> some<00:02:02.740> of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
get a little bit carried away on some of

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.260 
get a little bit carried away on some of
this<00:02:07.440> that<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.710> going<00:02:09.070> to<00:02:09.160> be<00:02:09.280> very<00:02:09.430> large<00:02:09.729> so

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
this that I is going to be very large so

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.170 
this that I is going to be very large so
let's<00:02:10.510> just<00:02:10.570> scale<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.170> down<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.440> little<00:02:11.620> bit

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
let's just scale it down a little bit

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
let's just scale it down a little bit
let's<00:02:13.180> scale<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.630> Z<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.170> little<00:02:14.860> bit<00:02:16.890> there

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
let's scale it on Z a little bit there

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:27.740 
let's scale it on Z a little bit there
we<00:02:18.010> go<00:02:18.570> it's<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.630> little<00:02:19.720> bit<00:02:19.960> better<00:02:24.990> okay<00:02:25.990> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
we go it's a little bit better okay so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.550 
we go it's a little bit better okay so
let's<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> edges<00:02:29.430> edges<00:02:30.430> excuse<00:02:31.360> me<00:02:31.560> grab

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
let's go to edges edges excuse me grab

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.310 
let's go to edges edges excuse me grab
all<00:02:32.710> these<00:02:32.890> edges<00:02:33.900> whoops<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:41.140> before

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
all these edges whoops and well before

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.580 
all these edges whoops and well before
that<00:02:42.240> let's<00:02:43.240> grab<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.570> right<00:02:44.080> here<00:02:44.470> inside

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that let's grab this right here inside

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.960 
that let's grab this right here inside
the<00:02:44.890> nose<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.460> go<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> side<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.910> to

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the nose and go to the side want to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.610 
the nose and go to the side want to
start<00:02:49.150> taking<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.600> kind<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.930> into<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.380> nose

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
start taking that kind of into the nose

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:02.850 
start taking that kind of into the nose
a<00:02:50.650> little<00:02:50.890> bit<00:02:52.650> there<00:02:53.650> we<00:02:53.770> go

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.400 

and<00:03:03.490> now<00:03:03.580> let's<00:03:03.790> grab<00:03:04.000> all<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:05.260> don't

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
and now let's grab all that we don't

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.290 
and now let's grab all that we don't
need<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.310> right<00:03:06.790> mouse<00:03:06.970> button

need that this all right mouse button
select<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.840> edge<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:10.180> going<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.390> smooth<00:03:10.570> it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
select that edge I'm going to smooth it

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.980 
select that edge I'm going to smooth it
just<00:03:10.870> one<00:03:11.020> time<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:12.580> extrude<00:03:13.410> let's<00:03:14.410> go<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.860> z

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
just one time you extrude let's go on z

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.760 
just one time you extrude let's go on z
scale<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.110> down<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.350> little<00:03:17.440> bit<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.170> let's

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
scale that down a little bit and let's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.110 
scale that down a little bit and let's
smooth<00:03:21.400> at<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:22.020> bajillion<00:03:23.020> times<00:03:24.120> thrilled

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
smooth at a bajillion times thrilled

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.920 
smooth at a bajillion times thrilled
real<00:03:25.630> number<00:03:26.790> grab<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.820> pull<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.390> back<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.780> up

go to the front just pull it in a little

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.600 
go to the front just pull it in a little
bit<00:03:31.300> not<00:03:31.630> too<00:03:31.660> far<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.950> want<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:33.250> vertices

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
bit not too far you want these vertices

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.390 
bit not too far you want these vertices
to<00:03:33.760> grab<00:03:34.209> each<00:03:34.390> other<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.200> mirror<00:03:36.330> and

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
to grab each other on the mirror and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.740

get all these will have to do some

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.760 
get all these will have to do some
tweaking<00:05:15.979> whoops<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.199> center<00:05:19.560> ones

don't<00:05:19.949> really<00:05:20.220> matter<00:05:20.370> at<00:05:20.580> all<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:24.300> let's

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
don't really matter at all so let's

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.969 
don't really matter at all so let's
scale<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.050> up<00:05:25.669> with<00:05:26.669> s<00:05:28.310> G<00:05:29.310> grab<00:05:29.669> move<00:05:30.979> out

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
scale that up with s G grab move out

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.930 
scale that up with s G grab move out
there<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:33.979> let<00:05:34.979> me<00:05:35.070> use<00:05:35.220> proportional<00:05:35.550> fall

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
there and let me use proportional fall

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.060 
there and let me use proportional fall
off<00:05:36.090> a<00:05:36.120> hotkey<00:05:37.010> 0g<00:05:38.010> grab<00:05:38.430> move<00:05:39.919> shrink<00:05:40.919> that

off a hotkey 0g grab move shrink that
down<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.310> little<00:05:41.430> bit

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.549 

let's<00:05:48.240> turn<00:05:48.479> that<00:05:48.599> off<00:05:48.809> that's<00:05:49.259> not<00:05:49.409> really

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.559 
let's turn that off that's not really

00:05:49.559 --> 00:06:11.130 
let's turn that off that's not really
helping<00:05:49.620> us<00:05:49.889> too<00:05:50.069> much

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:23.530 

take<00:06:12.140> that<00:06:12.290> down<00:06:12.530> here

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540
