down<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.520> road<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:19.050> see<00:02:19.230> right<00:02:19.620> away

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
down the road and we can see right away

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.229 
down the road and we can see right away
that<00:02:19.920> we're<00:02:20.250> running<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.819> richer

that we're running a little bit richer

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.570 
that we're running a little bit richer
the<00:02:21.810> real<00:02:21.989> question<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.890> we<00:02:22.950> always<00:02:23.190> too

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
the real question is are we always too

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.479 
the real question is are we always too
rich<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:24.060> too<00:02:24.150> rich<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.260> every<00:02:25.470> year<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:26.340> we

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
rich or too rich in every year do we

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.280 
rich or too rich in every year do we
have<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.670> gradual<00:02:27.120> lean<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.630> high<00:02:27.810> RPM

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
things like that to get to that next

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.690 
things like that to get to that next
level<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:31.080> need<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.410> log<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.830> data<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.280> more

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700

you are into any load condition and if

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.089 
you are into any load condition and if
once<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> tune<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.140> vehicle<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.830> get<00:02:56.010> it

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
once you tune your vehicle to get it

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.770 
once you tune your vehicle to get it

performance<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:59.370> one<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.360> real

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
performance then one of the real

performance then one of the real
advantages<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.349> our<00:03:01.440> system<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.370> can

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
advantages to our system is you can

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.130 
advantages to our system is you can
recalibrate<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> field<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.959> under

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
recalibrate in the field in under

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.289 
recalibrate in the field in under
different<00:03:04.470> conditions<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.000> go<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
different conditions so if you go to a

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.320 
different conditions so if you go to a
race<00:03:06.569> at<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.870> different<00:03:07.140> altitude<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:09.209> have

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
race at a different altitude or you have

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.449 
race at a different altitude or you have
a<00:03:09.360> major<00:03:10.019> change<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.709> temperature<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.220> other

a major change in temperature or other

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.670 
a major change in temperature or other
barometric<00:03:11.940> conditions<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:13.079> can<00:03:13.230> wreak<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
barometric conditions you can wreak a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.190 
barometric conditions you can wreak a
lat<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.250> new<00:03:14.459> location<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.299> then<00:03:15.690> get<00:03:15.930> right

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
lat that new location and then get right

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.229 
lat that new location and then get right
back<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.920> dead<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.310> perfect<00:03:17.880> air<00:03:18.030> fuel

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.060 
back to the dead on perfect air fuel
ratio<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.049> already<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.769> giving

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
ratio that you already know is giving

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.400 
ratio that you already know is giving
you<00:03:20.190> maximum<00:03:20.430> power

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.809 

so<00:03:27.410> let's<00:03:27.560> take<00:03:27.710> it<00:03:27.860> for<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> spin<00:03:28.310> get<00:03:28.670> some

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
so let's take it for a spin get some

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.190 
so let's take it for a spin get some
actual<00:03:29.090> Road<00:03:29.360> data<00:03:29.660> we're<00:03:29.870> going<00:03:29.990> to<00:03:30.050> create

into a single log file we got the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.680 
into a single log file we got the
wideband<00:03:42.680> hooked<00:03:42.980> up<00:03:43.190> we<00:03:43.400> got<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.820> ECU<00:03:44.510> of
