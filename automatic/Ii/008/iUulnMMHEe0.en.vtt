730<00:01:29.970> G<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.649> is<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> ones<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.759> was

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
730 G so this is one of the ones I was

730 G so this is one of the ones I was
looking<00:01:33.149> for<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.780> heard<00:01:34.319> that<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.679> was<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
looking for I heard that there was a

looking for I heard that there was a
pires<00:01:35.580> one<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.319> from<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.440> packaging<00:01:37.920> he

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
pires one and from the packaging he

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.340 
pires one and from the packaging he
obviously<00:01:38.459> looks<00:01:38.819> like<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.209> his<00:01:40.020> main

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
obviously looks like he his main

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.350 
obviously looks like he his main
attribute<00:01:41.009> would<00:01:41.160> be<00:01:41.250> pires<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:41.940> wanted<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
attribute would be pires so I wanted to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.830 
attribute would be pires so I wanted to
get<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.690> like<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> problem

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
get one like this and there is a problem

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.370 
get one like this and there is a problem
with<00:01:46.140> him<00:01:46.289> though<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.340> no<00:01:47.640> little

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
with him though that there's no little

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
with him though that there's no little
bar<00:01:49.380> inside<00:01:49.979> where<00:01:50.250> his<00:01:50.369> hand<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.539> his<00:01:51.690> hand

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
bar inside where his hand is so his hand

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
bar inside where his hand is so his hand
just<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.679> comes<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.190> out<00:01:53.399> which<00:01:53.970> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
just kind of comes right out which is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
just kind of comes right out which is
really<00:01:54.390> irritating<00:01:54.709> so<00:01:55.709> he'll<00:01:55.890> probably<00:01:56.130> lose

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
really irritating so he'll probably lose

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.850 
really irritating so he'll probably lose
his<00:01:56.459> hand<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.209> these<00:01:57.330> days<00:01:57.539> unless<00:01:58.470> I<00:01:58.679> just

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
his hand one of these days unless I just

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190 
his hand one of these days unless I just
keep<00:01:59.039> them<00:01:59.220> all<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.640> ball<00:02:00.000> form<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:00.990> on

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
keep them all in ball form from now on

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.279 
keep them all in ball form from now on
just<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.069> doesn't<00:02:02.130> happen<00:02:02.750> or<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.110> can

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
just so it doesn't happen or if I can

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.080 
just so it doesn't happen or if I can
find<00:02:04.500> something<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.979> shove<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.459> that<00:02:05.789> little

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
find something to shove in that little

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
find something to shove in that little
hole<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.569> try<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> maybe<00:02:07.110> keep<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.709> in<00:02:07.890> there

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
hole to try to maybe keep it in there

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.600 
hole to try to maybe keep it in there
but<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.420> anyway<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:11.099> there<00:02:11.280> was<00:02:11.430> him

aside<00:02:20.940> from<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.209> clear<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> viewer<00:02:21.959> which<00:02:22.140> I've

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
aside from a clear a viewer which I've

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800 
aside from a clear a viewer which I've
never<00:02:22.290> seen<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:23.069> have<00:02:23.459> every<00:02:23.940> attribute<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.630> B

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
never seen I have every attribute of a B

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.790 
never seen I have every attribute of a B
or<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.140> finally<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.790> aquos<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.780> 740<00:02:28.590> G

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
or now finally so the aquos one is 740 G

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.570 
or now finally so the aquos one is 740 G
and<00:02:30.349> just<00:02:31.349> open<00:02:31.620> them<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.980> little<00:02:32.010> bit<00:02:32.340> here

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
and just open them up a little bit here

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.900 
and just open them up a little bit here
so<00:02:32.989> there<00:02:33.989> he<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.319> all<00:02:34.590> areas<00:02:35.340> has<00:02:35.610> headed

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
so there he is all areas has headed

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.330 
so there he is all areas has headed
popped<00:02:36.270> up<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
popped up to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.590 
popped up to
so<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.730> said<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.060> really<00:02:40.180> hasn't<00:02:40.420> been

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
so like I said that really hasn't been

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.040 
so like I said that really hasn't been
much<00:02:40.750> else<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.410> do<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> video<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:43.050> probably

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
much else to do a video on so probably

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.950 
much else to do a video on so probably
won't<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.410> too<00:02:44.680> much<00:02:44.860> up<00:02:45.100> until<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.450> wave<00:02:46.600> 3

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
won't have too much up until the wave 3

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.450 
won't have too much up until the wave 3
start<00:02:47.230> showing<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:47.860> at<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.070> point

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
start showing up but at that point

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.500 
start showing up but at that point
hopefully<00:02:49.030> I'll<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.510> able<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.960> pick<00:02:50.140> up<00:02:50.730> some<00:02:51.730> I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
hopefully I'll be able to pick up some I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.600 
hopefully I'll be able to pick up some I

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
for like toys r us and stuff but aside

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.550 
for like toys r us and stuff but aside
from<00:02:57.280> that<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.970> don't<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.020> have<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.230> whole

lot of money to spend at the moment

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.590 
lot of money to spend at the moment

as money but i'm just hoping that i can
get<00:03:23.710> decent<00:03:23.980> amount<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.460> wave<00:03:24.670> 3<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.150> show<00:03:25.300> you

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
get decent amount of wave 3 to show you

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.380 
get decent amount of wave 3 to show you
guys<00:03:25.450> when<00:03:26.380> they<00:03:26.500> do<00:03:26.560> start<00:03:27.160> popping<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:27.940> but

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
guys when they do start popping up but

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.780 
guys when they do start popping up but
until<00:03:29.200> then<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.980> said<00:03:30.040> unless<00:03:30.520> there's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
until then like I said unless there's

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.280 
until then like I said unless there's
something<00:03:31.000> else<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.390> decide<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.990> want<00:03:32.050> to

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
something else I decide that I want to

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.590 
something else I decide that I want to
do<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> video<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:33.280> know<00:03:33.430> some<00:03:33.880> people<00:03:33.940> ask<00:03:34.450> me

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
do a video on I know some people ask me

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.130 
do a video on I know some people ask me
about<00:03:35.820> putting<00:03:36.820> up<00:03:36.940> my<00:03:37.120> Bakugan<00:03:37.630> dimension

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
about putting up my Bakugan dimension

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.440 
about putting up my Bakugan dimension
stuff<00:03:38.440> just<00:03:38.740> to<00:03:38.830> show<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.040> guys<00:03:39.250> my

collection<00:03:40.450> on<00:03:40.570> there<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.020> honestly<00:03:41.620> haven't

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
collection on there I honestly haven't

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.890 
collection on there I honestly haven't
been<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.490> vaca<00:03:42.760> God<00:03:43.000> dimensions<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.660> probably

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
been on vaca God dimensions and probably

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.510 
been on vaca God dimensions and probably
like<00:03:44.050> two<00:03:44.230> weeks<00:03:44.440> now<00:03:44.710> I<00:03:44.740> just<00:03:44.950> haven't<00:03:45.340> really

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
like two weeks now I just haven't really

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.250 
like two weeks now I just haven't really
had<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.060> times<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.720> have<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.900> lot<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.080> other

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
had the times I have a lot of other

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.520 
had the times I have a lot of other
stuff<00:03:47.320> I've<00:03:47.710> been<00:03:47.830> working<00:03:48.220> on<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.540> probably

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
stuff I've been working on so I probably

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.160 
stuff I've been working on so I probably
fell<00:03:50.920> way<00:03:51.250> behind<00:03:51.280> most<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.210> you<00:03:52.330> guys<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.900> was

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
fell way behind most of you guys I was

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.320 
fell way behind most of you guys I was
like<00:03:53.380> level<00:03:53.950> seven<00:03:54.340> hundred<00:03:54.670> something<00:03:55.090> back

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
like level seven hundred something back

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.150 
like level seven hundred something back
then<00:03:55.570> but<00:03:55.870> i'm<00:03:55.990> sure<00:03:56.020> a<00:03:56.560> lot<00:03:56.890> of<00:03:57.070> people

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
then but i'm sure a lot of people

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.090 
then but i'm sure a lot of people
probably<00:03:57.700> reach<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.330> by<00:03:58.540> now<00:03:58.770> since<00:03:59.770> i<00:03:59.890> did

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
probably reach that by now since i did

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.170 
probably reach that by now since i did
that<00:04:00.280> within<00:04:00.520> a<00:04:00.910> matter<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.480> few<00:04:01.660> days<00:04:03.180> like

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
that within a matter of a few days like

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.600 
that within a matter of a few days like
i<00:04:04.240> said<00:04:04.300> i<00:04:04.480> guess<00:04:04.810> i<00:04:05.020> might<00:04:05.380> do<00:04:06.280> something<00:04:06.459> like

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
i said i guess i might do something like

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.870 
i said i guess i might do something like
that<00:04:06.670> but<00:04:07.150> otherwise<00:04:08.220> my<00:04:09.220> next<00:04:09.490> video<00:04:09.730> will

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
that but otherwise my next video will
