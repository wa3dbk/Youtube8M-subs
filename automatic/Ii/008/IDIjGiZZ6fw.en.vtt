so I won't have to take up room in the
bush<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.330> batteries<00:01:27.920> draining<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.280> fluid

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
bush the batteries draining the fluid

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.440 
bush the batteries draining the fluid
that's<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.400> radiator<00:01:31.820> fluid<00:01:34.000> looks<00:01:35.000> like<00:01:35.240> GI

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
that's the radiator fluid looks like GI

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.890 

second<00:01:52.750> problem<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:57.570> what's<00:01:58.570> called<00:01:58.810> the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
second problem this is what's called the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.870 
second problem this is what's called the
jiggle<00:01:59.259> siphon<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:01.540> it's<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.750> marble<00:02:02.880> marble

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
jiggle siphon see it's a marble marble

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.370 
jiggle siphon see it's a marble marble
inside<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.360> little<00:02:04.659> children<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.080> fruit<00:02:05.259> in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
inside a little children your fruit in

inside a little children your fruit in
the<00:02:05.560> tank<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.520> go<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.940> what's<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the tank and you go like that what's the

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.930 
the tank and you go like that what's the
problem<00:02:10.319> won't<00:02:11.319> fit<00:02:11.620> in<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:11.860> unleaded<00:02:12.250> tank

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
problem won't fit in and unleaded tank

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.900 
problem won't fit in and unleaded tank
because<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.959> Diggle<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.819> be<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:17.910> master

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
because the Diggle not is to be a master
