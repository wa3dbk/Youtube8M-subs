silver show and it shows up really nice
on<00:00:39.780> camera<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.500> why<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> chose<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
on camera so that's why I chose this

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.369 
on camera so that's why I chose this
color<00:00:41.160> today

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
color today

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.990

a<00:00:45.030> lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.239> hair<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.110> probably<00:00:46.469> best<00:00:46.620> for

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
can wear this but it's just not as

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.700 
can wear this but it's just not as
stable<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.720> rectangle<00:01:34.260> large<00:01:34.440> cloth

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
stable as a rectangle large cloth

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
stable as a rectangle large cloth
although<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.310> does<00:01:35.430> look<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:35.640> pretty<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
although it does look very pretty so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:50.700 
although it does look very pretty so
I'll<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.660> show<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.050> it<00:01:37.170> looks<00:01:37.350> like

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.960 

The<00:01:51.710> Tortoise<00:01:51.950> show<00:01:52.190> color<00:01:52.430> probably<00:01:52.640> doesn't

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
The Tortoise show color probably doesn't

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.340 
The Tortoise show color probably doesn't
look<00:01:53.090> great<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.450> my<00:01:53.479> head<00:01:53.780> since<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.080> camera

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
look great in my head since the camera

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.380 
look great in my head since the camera
is<00:01:54.380> quite<00:01:54.590> dark<00:01:54.860> but<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.550> can<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:56.180> get<00:01:56.300> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
is quite dark but you can just get the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.780 
is quite dark but you can just get the

medium<00:02:07.310> claw<00:02:07.790> now<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.860> less

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
medium claw now this is the less

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.640 
medium claw now this is the less
expensive<00:02:10.459> version<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.030> them<00:02:11.240> on<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:12.320> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
expensive version of them on so so it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.650 
expensive version of them on so so it
holds<00:02:12.860> roughly<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> same<00:02:13.880> amount<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.300> hair<00:02:14.510> as

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
holds roughly the same amount of hair as

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.630 
holds roughly the same amount of hair as

they<00:02:19.370> probably<00:02:19.580> hold<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> same<00:02:20.360> amount<00:02:20.540> of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
staple as the rectangle large claw but

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.790 
staple as the rectangle large claw but
it<00:02:26.150> does<00:02:26.300> stay<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.630> my<00:02:26.750> hair<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.739> a

really<00:02:27.950> nice<00:02:28.160> comfortable<00:02:28.640> hold<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.120> just

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
really nice comfortable hold so I just

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:43.530 
really nice comfortable hold so I just

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.110 

again<00:02:44.439> probably<00:02:44.709> doesn't<00:02:45.280> look<00:02:45.400> brilliant<00:02:45.970> on

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.720 
again probably doesn't look brilliant on
camera<00:02:46.540> because<00:02:47.080> it's<00:02:47.260> quite<00:02:47.439> dark<00:02:47.709> but<00:02:48.069> it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
camera because it's quite dark but it

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.220

hurt<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:54.220> prefer<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.610> rectangle<00:02:55.060> logic

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
hurt I just prefer the rectangle logic

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.229 
hurt I just prefer the rectangle logic
long<00:02:55.450> as<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.720> gives<00:02:55.840> me<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.079> bit<00:02:56.319> more<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:58.000> hold

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
long as it gives me a bit more just hold

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.880 
long as it gives me a bit more just hold
for<00:02:58.689> long<00:02:58.810> badgering<00:02:59.200> as<00:02:59.439> I<00:02:59.530> don't<00:02:59.590> have<00:02:59.829> to
