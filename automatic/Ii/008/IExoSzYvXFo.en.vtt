00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.199
 but 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.030
 Hello, this is the second lesson on the mold 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.210
 acoustic guitar in the first lesson we 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.790
 studied the basics know where you came from 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.240
 blindly how about using it 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.710
 and in this lesson we will learn more 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.220
 sophisticated technique 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 consider a couple of exercises and learn 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.650
 play 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.580
 really cool so go sloppy 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.850
 In this standard there is besides the very 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.090
 layer by that is here is the strike 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 there is also such a so-called reception 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.360
 pop called pop he is essentially hooked 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.680
 that is, he went too 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.550
 from bass guitar pop this is basically according to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.520
 flail strings 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.700
 either index or average or 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.180
 ring finger but she clings 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.050
 so that she struggled a little bit the Blood 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.539
 there is such a little rattling sound 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.500
 it should work but it's on bass guitars 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.770
 there are thicker strings they have more 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.590
 swing amplitude here but if 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.750
 can be transferred to acoustic guitar 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.090
 too, how to use so 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.380
 We first consider the exercise purely for 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:18.550
 layer by that is for here for shock 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:22.010
 technique take five notes starting at 3 on 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.690
 6 strings and that is, we must paws 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.690
 we will extract 50 such 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.370
 this is basically pentatonic 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:40.670
 i.e. 3 6 strings 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.770
 6 watt sixth string further go on 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.570
 fifth fret 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.880
 war fifth string 3 fret 4 fret and 5 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:54.080
 now all this is consistent we have to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.500
 dos play slap try first in 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.500
 slow pace 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:13.000
 and back basically as I said in 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.160
 first lesson you can play further on 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.940
 strings that is either 4 to 3 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.700
 but it won't be the very one 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.000
 this sound is blind because the string is not 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.490
 blood will beat here this rattling 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.890
 sound and not so try to sit 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.890
 play these five notes with a slap 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:51.520
 back there then there are some with some 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.130
 variations and things like that when you 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.530
 approximately get used to it a little 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.940
 learn you can go to yourself here 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.640
 this second reception dad is so weird 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.440
 sounding reception and so how do you do in 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.390
 In principle, this is how I spoke as usual . 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.180
 flail strings that is we will just be 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.070
 make mostly forefinger 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.020
 finger 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.520
 let's try to make out what i am 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.990
 played at the very beginning this reef so 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.490
 say weak try try it 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.020
 consider at first just slow me 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.020
 play slowly at first sacrifice 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:51.550
 that is, what did we play the third 6 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.980
 the string on the third fret blindly 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:03.400
 further we make pop that is just jerking 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:09.160
 string the fourth on the fifth fret and pull 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:13.390
 u so well that is, we play no frigate 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.970
 that is, the string after we go and 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.970
 I let go that is so that the sound is interrupted 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:27.090
 such a short sound should turn out and 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.090
 so doing these two movements are weak 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.930
 then we go and play ours this one 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.100
 pentatonic these five notes 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.100
 straight in a row 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.070
 continue to play one more time again the same thing 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.670
 act 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:06:02.470
 weak on the sixth string three cases and pop on 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:06:05.060
 5 young 4 countries again go again 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.190
 we play this our pentatonic but we play 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.460
 four notes last note do not play 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:21.860
 that is, the fourth note we keep just 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:23.050
 a little longer then there is here the duration 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.500
 the notes will be longer 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:30.400
 Then we play again 1 part as well as in 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.400
 the beginning 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.970
 repeat 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:47.720
 and then do the same 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:58.060
 do pop on 5 string again 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:58.060
 the fifth fret is weak and we do pop on the 5 4 fret 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.640
 practice on this exercise it in 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.490
 the principle is simple if you sit a little 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.220
 and and really practice 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.620
 think up your exercise and not 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.680
 coming up quite easily can 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.710
 play some other frets 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.880
 principle on this all thanks for watching 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.810
 subscribe to my channel link 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.750
 somewhere here 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.000
 don't forget to like come in 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:37.330
 VKontakte group there is a lot of something 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.330
 Thank you all for now
