00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
going on with this see my point is a lot

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.110 
going on with this see my point is a lot
of<00:00:32.160> people<00:00:32.400> just<00:00:32.550> come<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:32.970> look

straight back here and that's why you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.140 
straight back here and that's why you
get<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.890> shot<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.790> crosshair

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
get that shot because it's crosshair

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.060 
get that shot because it's crosshair
placement<00:00:36.600> he's<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
placement he's not there so as a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.410 
placement he's not there so as a
terrorist<00:00:39.110> experience-wise<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> why

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
terrorist experience-wise this is why

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
terrorist experience-wise this is why
you<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.630> problems<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.470> first<00:00:43.830> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.220> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you have problems going first a lot of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.560 
you have problems going first a lot of
the<00:00:44.430> time<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.790> because<00:00:44.880> your<00:00:45.180> crosshair

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the time it's because your crosshair

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
the time it's because your crosshair
placement<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.190> good<00:00:47.400> at<00:00:47.550> some

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
placement which is really good at some

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.040 
placement which is really good at some
maps<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.390> only<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.810> you<00:00:49.020> have

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
maps it's only because you have

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.540 
maps it's only because you have
experience<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.830> getting<00:00:49.950> gained

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
experience of getting gained

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.100 
experience of getting gained
well<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.270> experience<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.870> going

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
well I have more experience at going

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650 
well I have more experience at going
first<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.470> getting<00:00:52.650> Guedes<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.970> would<00:00:54.450> just

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
first and getting Guedes so I would just

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.000 
first and getting Guedes so I would just
in<00:00:54.810> a<00:00:54.930> sense<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.290> better<00:00:55.440> cross<00:00:55.800> very

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in a sense of better cross very

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.830 
in a sense of better cross very

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.569 
if nothing's crowd speak there usually
people<00:01:30.539> go<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.889> they<00:01:32.009> like

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
people go like this and then they like

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.309 
people go like this and then they like
they<00:01:32.729> scan<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:34.020> window

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
they scan up like right up to the window

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.319 
they scan up like right up to the window
they<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.920> come<00:01:35.039> up<00:01:35.069> and<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.179> this

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
they just come up and go like this

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.059 
they just come up and go like this
what's<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.749> on<00:01:36.929> and<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.319> walk<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
what's going on and they walk like this

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.760 
what's going on and they walk like this
and<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.429> skip<00:01:38.789> this<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.749> basically<00:01:40.469> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and so they skip this so basically if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.709 
and so they skip this so basically if
you<00:01:41.069> see<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.270> sitting<00:01:42.569> on<00:01:42.659> that

shooting him not only that but the point

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.920 
shooting him not only that but the point
is<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.040> allow<00:01:56.549> him<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.060> expose<00:01:57.690> himself

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
is that you allow him to expose himself

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
is that you allow him to expose himself
to<00:01:58.290> such<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> deep<00:01:58.860> angle<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.150> switch

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to such a deep angle that you can switch

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.820 
to such a deep angle that you can switch
to<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.780> side<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.229> box<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.560> ream<00:02:01.800> him

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
to that side of the box and ream him

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.160 
to that side of the box and ream him
before<00:02:02.340> he<00:02:02.399> chases<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> away<00:02:03.149> meaning<00:02:03.840> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
before he chases you away meaning this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.109 
before he chases you away meaning this
like<00:02:04.470> if<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.159> peeking<00:02:05.520> him<00:02:05.640> here<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like if you're peeking him here and you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.139 
like if you're peeking him here and you
see<00:02:06.330> them<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.640> can't<00:02:08.940> see

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
see them and you like like you can't see

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.550 
see them and you like like you can't see
him<00:02:09.270> now<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.660> they'll<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.380> unless

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
him now because they'll be like unless

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.710 
him now because they'll be like unless
he<00:02:10.770> runs<00:02:10.950> forward<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.180> them<00:02:12.330> here

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
he runs forward but if you see them here

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.500 
he runs forward but if you see them here
and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.980> way<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.790> would<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.300> catch

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and then go this way you would go catch

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.330 
and then go this way you would go catch
him<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.930> he<00:02:16.080> won't<00:02:16.260> be<00:02:16.380> able<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> run<00:02:16.770> away<00:02:17.040> or

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
him like he won't be able to run away or

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.670 
him like he won't be able to run away or
maneuver<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:18.239> anything<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> point<00:02:19.560> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
maneuver or anything so the point is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 
maneuver or anything so the point is
that's<00:02:19.830> why<00:02:20.070> this<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.489> good<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.120> catch

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that's why this is good and you catch

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.250 
that's why this is good and you catch
them<00:02:21.540> exposed<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.440> whatever<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.600> main<00:02:27.840> point

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
them exposed for whatever the main point

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.229 
them exposed for whatever the main point
is<00:02:28.350> regardless<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.100> your<00:02:29.220> reality<00:02:29.489> think

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
is regardless of your reality think

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.820 
is regardless of your reality think
still<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.750> already<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:31.410> already<00:02:31.440> gonna

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
still is already you're already gonna

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.740 
still is already you're already gonna
lose<00:02:32.069> if<00:02:32.280> you're<00:02:32.400> sitting<00:02:32.580> still<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.600> your

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
lose if you're sitting still but your

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.050 
lose if you're sitting still but your
your<00:02:34.110> reaction<00:02:34.709> time<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.130> better<00:02:35.400> than<00:02:35.819> his

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
your reaction time is better than his

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.000 
your reaction time is better than his
and<00:02:36.360> it'll<00:02:36.569> just<00:02:36.930> look<00:02:37.019> amazing<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.739> his

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and it'll just look amazing because his

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.290 
and it'll just look amazing because his
crosshair<00:02:38.489> he'll<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.120> this

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
crosshair he'll have to go like this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.120 
crosshair he'll have to go like this
they'll<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> come<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.530> go<00:02:40.650> what's

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
they'll have to come out and go what's

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.540 
they'll have to come out and go what's
gone

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
gone

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.309 
gone
and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.450> flip<00:02:42.690> down<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.140> he's

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and then like flip down to you he's

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.390 
and then like flip down to you he's
never<00:02:43.470> gonna<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.920> shot<00:02:44.130> off<00:02:44.250> you're

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400

gonna kill him

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
gonna kill him
first<00:02:45.420> every<00:02:45.780> time<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.800> what<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.160> just

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
first every time and so what I was just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.070 
first every time and so what I was just
saying<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.060> said<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.510> preference

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
saying is you said it's just preference

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.350 
saying is you said it's just preference
it's<00:02:49.230> not<00:02:49.440> preference<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.610> beating<00:02:51.090> like

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
it's not preference it's beating like

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.850 
it's not preference it's beating like
you're<00:02:51.630> their<00:02:51.810> crosshair<00:02:52.230> placement<00:02:52.680> unless

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
you're their crosshair placement unless

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.319 
you're their crosshair placement unless
the<00:02:53.040> guy<00:02:53.160> comes<00:02:53.370> out<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.610> goes<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.120> and

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
the guy comes out and goes like this and

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.210 
the guy comes out and goes like this and
then<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.989> goes<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.500> Ted<00:02:55.829> knows<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
then just goes like this Ted knows to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280 
then just goes like this Ted knows to
look<00:02:56.370> for<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.060> Ted<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.570> taught<00:02:58.049> Ted

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
look for it but because Ted I taught Ted

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.580 
look for it but because Ted I taught Ted
this<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.610> anyway<00:02:59.910> that's<00:03:00.570> why<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.560> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
this but so anyway that's why this is a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.229 
this but so anyway that's why this is a
really<00:03:01.680> good<00:03:02.040> CT<00:03:02.400> spot<00:03:02.730> because<00:03:02.940> they<00:03:03.060> come

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
really good CT spot because they come

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.580 
really good CT spot because they come
out<00:03:03.299> looking<00:03:03.660> they're<00:03:03.870> not<00:03:04.079> even<00:03:04.320> at<00:03:04.440> you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
out looking they're not even at you

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.949 
out looking they're not even at you
that's<00:03:05.100> why<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.239> good<00:03:06.390> spot

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that's why that is a really good spot

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.800 
that's why that is a really good spot
the<00:03:07.530> reason<00:03:07.860> why<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> also<00:03:08.730> random<00:03:09.150> he<00:03:09.329> timing

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
the reason why and also random he timing

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.140 
the reason why and also random he timing
timing<00:03:10.230> random<00:03:10.980> peak<00:03:11.130> timing<00:03:11.519> would<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.670> this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
timing random peak timing would be this

Mississippi 5 Mississippi I check it and

Mississippi 5 Mississippi I check it and
that<00:03:53.560> way

that way

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.940 
that way
basically<00:03:54.849> if<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:56.080> would<00:03:56.230> mean<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.500> you're

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
basically if that would mean that you're

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.309 
basically if that would mean that you're
checking<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:58.150> moment<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.720> they<00:03:58.840> like

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
checking the moment that they like

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.380 
checking the moment that they like
you're<00:04:00.010> pretending<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.610> every<00:04:00.819> 5<00:04:01.000> seconds

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
you're pretending that every 5 seconds

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.330 
you're pretending that every 5 seconds
he's<00:04:01.540> waiting<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.170> go<00:04:02.319> he's<00:04:02.650> like<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.010> boom

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
he's waiting to go he's like this boom

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.420 
he's waiting to go he's like this boom
and<00:04:03.550> then<00:04:04.000> he<00:04:04.090> goes<00:04:04.209> exhausted<00:04:04.930> even<00:04:05.830> so<00:04:06.220> what

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
and then he goes exhausted even so what

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.309 
and then he goes exhausted even so what
the<00:04:06.610> reason<00:04:06.970> why<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.239> can't<00:04:07.660> just<00:04:07.870> sit<00:04:08.049> still

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
the reason why you can't just sit still

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.050 
the reason why you can't just sit still
I<00:04:08.560> see<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.099> in<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.310> back<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.610> bomb<00:04:09.819> site

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
I see you in the back of the bomb site

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.000 
I see you in the back of the bomb site
if<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.330> do<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.629> and<00:04:11.379> you<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.560> kind<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.890> go

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
if you do this and you just kind of go

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.440 
if you do this and you just kind of go
like<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.310> I'm<00:04:12.489> not<00:04:12.640> like<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:13.269> have<00:04:13.360> to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
like this I'm not like you have to

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.520 
like this I'm not like you have to
figure<00:04:13.599> out<00:04:13.780> they<00:04:13.900> can<00:04:14.049> see<00:04:14.170> your<00:04:14.290> head<00:04:14.410> over

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
figure out they can see your head over

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.809 
figure out they can see your head over
the<00:04:14.680> box<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.130> shit<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.400> you're<00:04:15.489> gonna<00:04:15.610> know

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
the box and shit and you're gonna know

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.610 
the box and shit and you're gonna know
that<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:16.600> when<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.810> sit<00:04:17.049> like<00:04:17.229> if<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.470> see<00:04:17.560> I

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
that but when you sit like if you see I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.870 
that but when you sit like if you see I
think<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:17.889> basically<00:04:18.250> if<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.489> sit<00:04:18.700> any

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
think it's basically if you sit any

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.879 
think it's basically if you sit any
further<00:04:19.120> back<00:04:19.419> than<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:19.780> any<00:04:20.049> if<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.620> sit

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
further back than this any if you sit

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.530 
further back than this any if you sit
any<00:04:21.070> farther<00:04:21.400> back<00:04:21.669> than<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.270> opera

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
any farther back than this and opera

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.330 
any farther back than this and opera
conduct<00:04:23.080> double<00:04:23.500> scope<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.919> see<00:04:24.040> your<00:04:24.190> head

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
conduct double scope and see your head

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.850 
conduct double scope and see your head
now<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.600> point<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:25.960> if<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.200> just<00:04:26.410> sit<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.590> I'm

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
now the point is if you just sit and I'm

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.080 
now the point is if you just sit and I'm
not<00:04:27.040> sure<00:04:27.190> if<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:27.430> tucked<00:04:27.639> or<00:04:27.760> not<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:27.970> got

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
not sure if it's tucked or not you got

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.070 
not sure if it's tucked or not you got
to<00:04:28.120> figure<00:04:28.389> it<00:04:28.479> out<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:28.750> I'm<00:04:28.870> pretty<00:04:28.990> sure

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
to figure it out but I'm pretty sure
