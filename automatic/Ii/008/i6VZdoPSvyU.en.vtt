designer and I'm going to go over bead
cap<00:00:07.050> basics

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
cap basics

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.720 
cap basics
I'm<00:00:10.260> just<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.680> go<00:00:10.830> over<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> few<00:00:11.190> pointers

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I'm just going to go over a few pointers

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.699 
I'm just going to go over a few pointers
when<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.059> comes<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> using<00:00:12.570> bead<00:00:12.930> caps<00:00:13.230> I've

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
when it comes to using bead caps I've

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.160 
when it comes to using bead caps I've
got<00:00:14.010> three<00:00:14.459> different<00:00:14.760> size<00:00:14.969> beads<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.719> two

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
got three different size beads in two

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
got three different size beads in two
different<00:00:16.349> shapes<00:00:16.860> and<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.460> variety<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.970> bead

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
different shapes and a variety of bead

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
different shapes and a variety of bead
caps<00:00:18.599> that<00:00:18.960> I'm<00:00:19.110> just<00:00:19.349> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> show<00:00:19.740> you

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
caps that I'm just going to show you

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.589 
caps that I'm just going to show you
what<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.189> difference<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.700> in<00:00:20.880> between<00:00:20.970> sizes

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
what the difference is in between sizes

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.260 
what the difference is in between sizes
and<00:00:22.169> the<00:00:22.950> bead<00:00:23.130> cap<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.580> well<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:23.970> how<00:00:24.090> they're

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
and the bead cap as well as how they're

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.630 
and the bead cap as well as how they're
used<00:00:24.450> on<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> beans

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
used on the beans

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.249 
used on the beans
basically<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.239> I<00:00:27.270> take<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> question<00:00:27.899> on

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
basically what when I take a question on

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.609 
basically what when I take a question on
what<00:00:28.439> size<00:00:28.649> bead<00:00:28.950> cap<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.640> use<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.439> question<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
what size bead cap to use my question to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.130 
what size bead cap to use my question to
their<00:00:31.770> answer<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.219> always<00:00:32.430> how<00:00:33.420> much<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
their answer is always how much of the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660 
their answer is always how much of the
bead<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> want<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> cover<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> bead

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
bead do you want to cover with the bead

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
bead do you want to cover with the bead
cap<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.570> case<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.110> am<00:00:37.440> using<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.920> three

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
cap in this case I am using a three

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790 
cap in this case I am using a three
point<00:00:38.489> five<00:00:38.730> by<00:00:38.969> six<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:39.540> five<00:00:39.809> millimeter

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
point five by six point five millimeter

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.090 
point five by six point five millimeter
rope<00:00:41.760> bead<00:00:42.660> cap<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.560> is<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:43.770> six

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
rope bead cap and this is a six

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
rope bead cap and this is a six
millimeter<00:00:44.310> round<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.060> I'm<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.720> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
millimeter round and I'm just going to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.010 
millimeter round and I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:46.400> that<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.120> use<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.990> know

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
demonstrate that you can use you know

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.110 
demonstrate that you can use you know
this<00:00:49.410> smaller<00:00:49.740> bead<00:00:50.040> cap<00:00:50.310> on<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> small<00:00:50.880> bead

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this smaller bead cap on a small bead

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
this smaller bead cap on a small bead
then<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.630> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.900> show<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
then I'm also going to show you what it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.860 
then I'm also going to show you what it
looks<00:00:52.560> like<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> larger<00:00:53.280> bead<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
looks like on a larger bead and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.060 
looks like on a larger bead and
basically<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.290> beaut<00:00:55.560> cap<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> just

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
basically this little beaut cap is just

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.670 
basically this little beaut cap is just
covering<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.880> ends<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.780> round<00:00:58.050> bead<00:00:58.380> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
covering the ends of this round bead and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.190 
covering the ends of this round bead and
then<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.520> will<00:00:59.670> show<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.810> looks<00:01:01.020> when

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
then I will show you how it looks when

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.549 
then I will show you how it looks when
you<00:01:01.320> put<00:01:01.560> a<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.480> bigger<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:04.079> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.439> this

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you put a a bigger around I think this

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.639 
you put a a bigger around I think this
is<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:04.829> 8<00:01:05.070> millimeter<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> basically<00:01:10.500> what

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
is an 8 millimeter and basically what

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.170 
is an 8 millimeter and basically what
you're<00:01:10.770> doing<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.159> you're<00:01:11.310> covering<00:01:11.670> less<00:01:11.939> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
you're doing is you're covering less of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.239 
you're doing is you're covering less of
the<00:01:12.299> bead<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.869> bead<00:01:13.110> cap<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.039> one

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
the bead with this bead cap and this one

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.950 
the bead with this bead cap and this one
is<00:01:14.399> really<00:01:14.579> just<00:01:14.880> capping<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.509> ends<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
is really just capping the very ends of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.649 
is really just capping the very ends of
it<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.829> the<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.060> round<00:01:18.329> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it you see more of the of the round and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.179 
it you see more of the of the round and
this<00:01:19.319> pretty<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:19.859> works<00:01:20.219> with<00:01:20.460> any<00:01:22.189> shaped

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
this pretty much works with any shaped

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.279 
this pretty much works with any shaped
bead<00:01:23.429> that<00:01:23.609> you<00:01:23.670> use<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.329> these<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:25.020> thing

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
bead that you use with these the thing

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.709 
bead that you use with these the thing
is<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:25.950> doesn't<00:01:26.249> have<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.450> same

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
is is it doesn't have to be the same

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.109 
is is it doesn't have to be the same
size<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.469> bead<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.429> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.729> even

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
size as the bead and as you can see even

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
size as the bead and as you can see even
on<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.389> it<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.840> shows<00:01:31.139> it<00:01:31.439> covers<00:01:31.920> less<00:01:32.219> of<00:01:32.459> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
on this it it shows it covers less of it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
on this it it shows it covers less of it
but<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.179> just<00:01:33.359> whatever<00:01:33.569> design<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.319> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but it's just whatever design and the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
but it's just whatever design and the
fact<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.679> you<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> bead<00:01:35.340> cap<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
fact that you want the bead cap to have

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.359 
fact that you want the bead cap to have
on<00:01:35.999> the<00:01:36.149> bead<00:01:36.350> okay<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.889> same<00:01:38.130> bead

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
on the bead okay this is the same bead

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
on the bead okay this is the same bead
cap<00:01:38.639> but<00:01:39.149> in<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.359> case<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.779> using<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.200> six

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
cap but in this case I'm using a six

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
cap but in this case I'm using a six
millimeter<00:01:40.619> bicone<00:01:41.249> and<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.609> you<00:01:41.729> bring

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
millimeter bicone and when you bring

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
millimeter bicone and when you bring
these<00:01:42.149> together<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.350> hardly<00:01:43.619> tell<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
these together you can hardly tell that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
these together you can hardly tell that
this<00:01:44.279> is<00:01:44.459> a<00:01:44.490> bicone<00:01:44.969> it<00:01:45.090> does<00:01:45.270> cover<00:01:45.569> most<00:01:45.869> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
this is a bicone it does cover most of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749 
this is a bicone it does cover most of
the<00:01:46.079> ends<00:01:46.499> and<00:01:46.679> most<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.340> these<00:01:47.459> little

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the ends and most of these little

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.499 
the ends and most of these little
cone-shaped<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:49.310> bead<00:01:50.310> caps<00:01:50.609> will<00:01:50.909> cover<00:01:51.179> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
cone-shaped or bead caps will cover a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.580 
cone-shaped or bead caps will cover a
bicone<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> good<00:01:52.469> portion<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.889> the<00:01:53.039> bicone<00:01:53.459> body

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
bicone a good portion of the bicone body

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.039 
bicone a good portion of the bicone body
and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:55.859> if<00:01:56.039> you<00:01:56.189> show<00:01:56.639> you<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.389> larger<00:01:57.899> one

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and then if you show you on a larger one

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.580 
and then if you show you on a larger one
this<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.619> an<00:01:58.740> 8<00:01:58.950> millimeter<00:01:59.310> bicone<00:02:00.590> again

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this is an 8 millimeter bicone again

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.169 
this is an 8 millimeter bicone again
it's<00:02:01.770> covering<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.279> ends<00:02:02.609> of<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.849> but<00:02:03.060> you're

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
it's covering the ends of it but you're

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.529 
it's covering the ends of it but you're
getting<00:02:03.450> less<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.249> coverage<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
getting less of the coverage and now you

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.470 
getting less of the coverage and now you
can<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.229> tell<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.770> bicone<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
can really tell that it's a bicone and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.440 
can really tell that it's a bicone and
then<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> 10<00:02:13.050> millimeter<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.910> covers<00:02:15.240> even

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
then on a 10 millimeter it covers even

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.309 
then on a 10 millimeter it covers even
less

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.839 

and<00:02:21.319> again<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.190> effect<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.640> you

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
and again it's just the effect that you

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.540 
and again it's just the effect that you
want<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> bead<00:02:23.270> cap<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.599> have<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.870> your<00:02:23.989> bead

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
want the bead cap to have on your bead

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.820 
want the bead cap to have on your bead
just<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.670> show<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.390> same<00:02:26.720> basic<00:02:27.349> design

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
just to show you the same basic design

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.479 
just to show you the same basic design
this<00:02:28.489> is<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:29.030> sunflower<00:02:29.660> three<00:02:30.290> by<00:02:30.440> six<00:02:30.830> again

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
this is a sunflower three by six again

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.670 
this is a sunflower three by six again
I'm<00:02:31.670> just<00:02:31.790> showing<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.209> on<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.360> round<00:02:32.720> eight

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
with a seven millimeter bead cap so you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.440 
with a seven millimeter bead cap so you
can<00:03:09.650> kind<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.950> gauge<00:03:10.160> by<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.849> size<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
can kind of gauge by the size of the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.110 
can kind of gauge by the size of the
bead<00:03:11.599> cap<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.170> your<00:03:12.319> bead<00:03:12.849> again<00:03:13.849> obviously

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
bead cap to your bead again obviously

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.470 
bead cap to your bead again obviously
with<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.989> size<00:03:15.739> crystal<00:03:16.519> or<00:03:16.970> bead<00:03:17.269> it's

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
with that size crystal or bead it's

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.410 
with that size crystal or bead it's
gonna<00:03:17.599> cover<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.989> majority<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:20.269> then

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
gonna cover a majority of it and then

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.059 
gonna cover a majority of it and then
when<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:20.630> try<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.200> with<00:03:21.470> an<00:03:21.620> eight<00:03:21.829> millimeter

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
when you try it with an eight millimeter

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.599 
when you try it with an eight millimeter
crystal<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:26.630> can<00:03:26.780> see<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.410> caps<00:03:27.859> the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
crystal you can see that it caps the

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.940 
crystal you can see that it caps the
edges<00:03:29.120> of<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.480> but<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.989> doesn't<00:03:30.170> cover<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:30.739> much

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
edges of it but it doesn't cover as much

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.259 
edges of it but it doesn't cover as much
of<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> body<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.670> bead<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.940> with<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
of the body of the bead and with the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.650 
of the body of the bead and with the
bicone<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:37.250> can<00:03:37.549> use<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:37.970> style<00:03:38.329> on<00:03:38.630> a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
bicone you can use this style on a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.530 
bicone you can use this style on a
bicone<00:03:39.230> bead<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.829> it<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.609> changes<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.180> look

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
bicone bead and it just changes the look

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.140 
bicone bead and it just changes the look
of<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.870> completely<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:46.400> an<00:03:46.519> idea<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.970> how

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
of it completely so just an idea of how

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.789 
of it completely so just an idea of how
you<00:03:47.209> can<00:03:47.480> use<00:03:47.630> some<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.900> these<00:03:48.019> rounder<00:03:48.560> bead

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
you can use some of these rounder bead

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.160 
you can use some of these rounder bead
caps<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.370> rounds<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.299> B<00:03:50.480> caps<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.959> in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
caps on rounds and B caps and in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.009 
caps on rounds and B caps and in
conjunction<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.980> sizes<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.760> bead

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
conjunction to the sizes of the bead

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.710 
conjunction to the sizes of the bead
okay<00:03:54.019> now<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.739> an<00:03:55.250> 8<00:03:55.850> millimeter<00:03:56.389> bead

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
okay now this is an 8 millimeter bead

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.840 
okay now this is an 8 millimeter bead
cap<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:58.100> wanted<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.400> show<00:03:58.549> you<00:03:58.579> what

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
cap and I wanted to show you what

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.879 
cap and I wanted to show you what
happens<00:03:59.150> when<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.389> send<00:03:59.900> an<00:04:00.019> 8<00:04:00.319> millimeter

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
happens when you send an 8 millimeter

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.309 
happens when you send an 8 millimeter
with<00:04:01.069> a<00:04:01.100> 6<00:04:01.459> millimeter<00:04:01.700> bead<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.690> really<00:04:03.079> lose

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
with a 6 millimeter bead you really lose

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.800 
with a 6 millimeter bead you really lose
the<00:04:03.349> bead<00:04:03.799> altogether<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.359> might<00:04:05.599> help

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
the bead altogether so this might help

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.300 
the bead altogether so this might help
you<00:04:05.989> kind<00:04:06.139> of<00:04:06.260> decide<00:04:06.590> whether<00:04:06.889> or<00:04:07.010> not<00:04:07.130> an

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
you kind of decide whether or not an

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.530 
you kind of decide whether or not an
eight<00:04:07.430> millimeter<00:04:07.639> works<00:04:08.060> on<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> six

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
eight millimeter works on a six

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.210 
eight millimeter works on a six
millimeter<00:04:08.750> or<00:04:09.079> not<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.440> if<00:04:09.920> that's<00:04:10.069> the

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
millimeter or not and if that's the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.009 
millimeter or not and if that's the
effect<00:04:10.639> or<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.910> look<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.209> want<00:04:11.389> then<00:04:11.690> great

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
effect or the look you want then great

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.900 
effect or the look you want then great
but<00:04:12.530> it's<00:04:13.130> probably<00:04:13.340> something<00:04:13.639> that<00:04:13.880> I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
but it's probably something that I

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.680 
but it's probably something that I
wouldn't<00:04:14.299> do<00:04:14.980> but<00:04:15.980> using<00:04:16.789> this<00:04:16.940> 8<00:04:17.150> millimeter

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
wouldn't do but using this 8 millimeter

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.580 
wouldn't do but using this 8 millimeter
on<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.019> 10<00:04:18.380> millimeter<00:04:18.650> bead<00:04:20.139> again<00:04:21.139> changes

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
on a 10 millimeter bead again changes

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.290 
on a 10 millimeter bead again changes
the<00:04:21.739> effect<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.770> can<00:04:24.979> just<00:04:25.190> kind<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.490> get

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
the effect and you can just kind of get

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.120 
the effect and you can just kind of get
a<00:04:26.360> basic<00:04:26.990> idea<00:04:27.080> when<00:04:27.440> you're<00:04:27.560> looking<00:04:27.770> online

actually<00:04:33.820> very<00:04:34.230> versatile<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.440> me<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.890> this

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
actually very versatile to me and this

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.600 
actually very versatile to me and this
is<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.600> we<00:04:37.690> call<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.930> ten<00:04:38.290> millimeter<00:04:38.610> Bali

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
is what we call a ten millimeter Bali

is what we call a ten millimeter Bali
bead<00:04:39.850> cap<00:04:40.090> flower<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.020> what<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.710> like<00:04:41.980> about<00:04:42.160> it

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
bead cap flower and what I like about it

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.140 
bead cap flower and what I like about it
is<00:04:42.640> that<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.940> use<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> wok<00:04:43.990> with<00:04:44.200> pendants<00:04:44.830> or

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
is that I use a wok with pendants or

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.400 
is that I use a wok with pendants or
things<00:04:46.150> like<00:04:46.240> this<00:04:46.450> as<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.780> can<00:04:46.810> see<00:04:46.930> how<00:04:47.290> it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
things like this as you can see how it

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.650 
things like this as you can see how it
doesn't<00:04:47.770> really<00:04:47.860> conform<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.820> bicone<00:04:49.180> but

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
doesn't really conform to the bicone but

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.270 
doesn't really conform to the bicone but
the<00:04:49.750> great<00:04:49.960> thing<00:04:50.200> about<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.710> one<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:50.950> is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the great thing about this one is is

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.040 
the great thing about this one is is
that<00:04:51.490> if<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:51.700> gently<00:04:52.000> mesh<00:04:52.300> down<00:04:52.600> on<00:04:52.930> this

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
that if you gently mesh down on this

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.710 
that if you gently mesh down on this
bead<00:04:53.290> cap<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.640> bring<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.180> down<00:04:55.420> around

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
bead cap you can bring it down around

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.050 
bead cap you can bring it down around
the<00:04:56.140> bead<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.890> you're<00:04:57.040> using<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.910> use

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
the bead that you're using I like to use

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.230 
the bead that you're using I like to use
it<00:04:58.240> at<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.480> top<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:59.080> pendant<00:04:59.590> you<00:05:00.430> be<00:05:00.640> a<00:05:00.670> flat

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
it at the top of a pendant you be a flat

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.630 
it at the top of a pendant you be a flat
pendant<00:05:01.810> or<00:05:02.020> an<00:05:02.110> oval<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.830> then<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.310> can<00:05:03.490> just

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
pendant or an oval and then I can just

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.550 
pendant or an oval and then I can just
mash<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.240> petals<00:05:04.600> down<00:05:04.840> around<00:05:05.140> it<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.440> see

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
mash the petals down around it and see

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.500 
mash the petals down around it and see
how<00:05:05.680> that<00:05:05.890> is<00:05:06.040> really<00:05:06.280> conformed<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.360> back

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
how that is really conformed to the back

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.390 
how that is really conformed to the back
home<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.500> does<00:05:08.710> make<00:05:08.920> a<00:05:08.950> really<00:05:09.040> nice

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
home and that does make a really nice

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.970 
home and that does make a really nice
cap<00:05:09.760> for<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.540> pendant<00:05:11.410> especially<00:05:11.800> if<00:05:11.860> your

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
cap for a pendant especially if your

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.490 
cap for a pendant especially if your
wire<00:05:12.160> wrapping<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.610> loop<00:05:12.760> at<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:12.970> top<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:14.470> just

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
wire wrapping a loop at the top it just

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.160 
wire wrapping a loop at the top it just
adds<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.920> little<00:05:15.040> interest<00:05:15.430> this<00:05:16.390> is<00:05:16.600> an<00:05:16.780> 11

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
adds a little interest this is an 11

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.470 
adds a little interest this is an 11
millimeter<00:05:17.500> bead<00:05:18.220> cap<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:18.820> pretty<00:05:19.090> deep

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
millimeter bead cap and it's pretty deep

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.940

don't<00:05:33.280> have<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.670> use<00:05:33.850> two<00:05:34.150> bead<00:05:34.840> caps<00:05:35.170> per<00:05:35.500> bead

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
don't have to use two bead caps per bead

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.680 
don't have to use two bead caps per bead
you<00:05:36.040> may<00:05:36.220> only<00:05:36.400> use<00:05:36.520> one<00:05:36.970> on<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.270> top<00:05:37.450> of<00:05:37.630> the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
you may only use one on the top of the

you may only use one on the top of the
bottom<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.740> have<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.400> bracelet<00:05:39.760> online<00:05:40.420> that

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
bottom I have a bracelet online that

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.810 
bottom I have a bracelet online that
I've<00:05:40.780> done<00:05:40.960> where<00:05:41.170> I<00:05:41.200> just<00:05:41.290> used<00:05:41.680> one<00:05:42.010> and<00:05:42.400> it

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
I've done where I just used one and it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.220 
I've done where I just used one and it
will<00:05:42.970> put<00:05:43.150> it<00:05:43.180> on<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.480> side<00:05:43.660> bar<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:43.960> this

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
will put it on the side bar of this

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.680 
will put it on the side bar of this
video<00:05:44.620> but<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:45.700> as<00:05:46.090> you<00:05:46.240> can<00:05:46.390> see<00:05:46.540> it<00:05:46.660> just

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
video but this as you can see it just

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.420 
video but this as you can see it just
completely<00:05:47.170> covers<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.530> top<00:05:47.800> half<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.220> this

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
completely covers the top half of this

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.360 
completely covers the top half of this
bead<00:05:48.730> and<00:05:48.940> this<00:05:49.420> is<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.750> bicone<00:05:50.200> and<00:05:50.410> we'll

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
bead and this is the bicone and we'll

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.980 
bead and this is the bicone and we'll
have<00:05:51.550> this<00:05:51.670> pretty<00:05:52.090> much<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.420> same<00:05:52.570> effect<00:05:52.720> on

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
have this pretty much the same effect on

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.230 
have this pretty much the same effect on
this<00:05:53.170> 10<00:05:53.350> millimeter<00:05:53.710> round<00:05:54.010> so<00:05:54.820> just<00:05:55.060> wanted

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
this 10 millimeter round so just wanted

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.900 
this 10 millimeter round so just wanted
to<00:05:55.300> give<00:05:55.390> you<00:05:55.600> an<00:05:55.690> idea<00:05:55.960> how<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.590> sizes<00:05:57.100> work

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
to give you an idea how the sizes work

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.880 
to give you an idea how the sizes work
and<00:05:58.180> this<00:05:58.450> how<00:05:58.660> this<00:05:58.840> one<00:05:59.050> really<00:05:59.290> covers<00:05:59.620> the

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
and this how this one really covers the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.230 
and this how this one really covers the
majority<00:06:00.010> of<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.490> bead<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.640> if<00:06:00.910> you<00:06:01.030> wanted

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
majority of the bead and if you wanted

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.630 
majority of the bead and if you wanted
to<00:06:01.300> put<00:06:01.570> the<00:06:02.530> second<00:06:02.950> one<00:06:02.980> on<00:06:03.070> here<00:06:03.460> you're

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
to put the second one on here you're

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.210 
to put the second one on here you're
almost<00:06:03.910> encasing<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.900> bead<00:06:05.110> with<00:06:05.950> the<00:06:06.070> bead

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
almost encasing the bead with the bead

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.050 
almost encasing the bead with the bead
caps<00:06:06.690> which<00:06:07.690> has<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.900> really<00:06:08.140> neat<00:06:08.380> effect<00:06:08.500> too

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
caps which has a really neat effect too

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.460 
caps which has a really neat effect too
one<00:06:10.060> more<00:06:10.240> example<00:06:10.600> that<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:10.960> was<00:06:11.110> just<00:06:11.290> going

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
one more example that I was just going

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.440 
one more example that I was just going
to<00:06:11.530> show<00:06:11.710> you<00:06:11.770> this<00:06:12.070> is<00:06:12.280> a<00:06:12.310> 10<00:06:12.760> millimeter<00:06:13.090> this

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
to show you this is a 10 millimeter this

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.770 
to show you this is a 10 millimeter this
is<00:06:13.630> our<00:06:13.780> spotter<00:06:14.200> Bally<00:06:14.890> bead<00:06:15.220> cap<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:15.780> using

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
is our spotter Bally bead cap and using

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.810 
is our spotter Bally bead cap and using
it<00:06:16.960> on<00:06:17.140> an<00:06:17.290> 8<00:06:17.500> millimeter<00:06:17.830> bead<00:06:18.220> just<00:06:18.460> as<00:06:18.670> we

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
it on an 8 millimeter bead just as we

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.940 
it on an 8 millimeter bead just as we
did<00:06:18.970> with<00:06:19.090> the<00:06:19.150> 11<00:06:19.690> millimeter<00:06:20.140> on<00:06:20.500> a<00:06:20.560> 10

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
did with the 11 millimeter on a 10

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.160 
did with the 11 millimeter on a 10
millimeter<00:06:21.220> bead<00:06:21.580> this<00:06:22.120> one<00:06:22.360> again<00:06:22.690> unless<00:06:23.020> in

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
millimeter bead this one again unless in

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.380 
millimeter bead this one again unless in
cases<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.680> whole<00:06:23.830> crystal<00:06:24.670> or<00:06:24.820> a<00:06:24.850> bead<00:06:25.120> and

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
cases the whole crystal or a bead and

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.300 
cases the whole crystal or a bead and
within<00:06:25.930> the<00:06:26.170> bead<00:06:26.320> caps<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:26.920> just<00:06:27.100> wanted

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
within the bead caps and I just wanted

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.000 
within the bead caps and I just wanted
to<00:06:27.430> to<00:06:28.000> show<00:06:28.180> you<00:06:28.240> this<00:06:28.600> example<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:29.380> now<00:06:29.770> just

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
to to show you this example to now just

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.650 
to to show you this example to now just
really<00:06:30.190> scratch<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.820> surface<00:06:31.030> on<00:06:31.300> our<00:06:31.450> bead

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
really scratch the surface on our bead

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.960 
really scratch the surface on our bead
caps<00:06:32.070> but<00:06:33.070> I<00:06:33.100> thought<00:06:33.310> kind<00:06:33.760> of<00:06:33.820> hope<00:06:33.940> that

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
caps but I thought kind of hope that

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.920 
caps but I thought kind of hope that
this<00:06:34.300> gave<00:06:34.600> you<00:06:34.750> an<00:06:34.870> idea<00:06:35.170> of<00:06:35.290> how<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.410> use<00:06:35.680> them
