00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.200
 hello on the field of sallois for 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 the test of the new mercedes the one to 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.530
 228 indrek tarand version fascination 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.420
 under the hood we find a 2 engine 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.190
 liters 2 which develops 177 horses 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.400
 sound obvious diesel 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.629
 this is included in an automatic transmission 7 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.470
 reports then concretely at the level 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.140
 consumption 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.269
 we are at 5 liters per 100 km 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.059
 Highway 110 with three people 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.520
 in the cockpit and the full chest 5 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.740
 lite 3 at 130 km / h in the same 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.119
 conditions with regard to the gauge of the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.869
 vehicle is frankly more than 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 reasonable level design the shield 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.710
 before incorporating sensors 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.710
 Here we find 18-inch wheels 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.799
 in back 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.400
 the presence of sensors but especially 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.450
 a backup camera is not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.429
 negligible when we look at the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.289
 interior retrovision and found in 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.570
 below two exhaust outlets 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.960
 all this being part of the amg pack 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.630
 line the lights are equipped with the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.630
 technology they are projectors 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.280
 bi xenon with lava headlights daytime running lights 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.909
 with red strapping as you can 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.829
 find right position lights at 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.020
 led indicators with variable distribution 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.609
 of lighting namely that lighting 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.819
 is active in turns and there are 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.469
 also the high beam assistant 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.329
 optional on this model we find the 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.340
 electric panoramic trot with 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.069
 sun blinds also electric 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.160
 it brings a little more especially in 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.400
 was inside so other names 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.640
 access without the key the first thing 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.890
 that we see here is the opening of the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.060
 hatchback which moreover is electric and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.490
 motorized we will come back with offers a 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.930
 little later the window controls 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.209
 and therefore electric seats and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.890
 memorable on the touch screen 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.210
 it also reads the display of the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.850
 reversing camera 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.890
 which is a real plus we look at the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.240
 retrovision more than mediocre but that's 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 normal since it is once again 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.570
 of a coupe to return briefly to 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.390
 the screen there is 8 inches there is the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.920
 3d navigation europe with update 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.400
 for three years just like the fake 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.370
 traffic 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.750
 you can control his grace through the voice he 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.170
 there is also the presence of a double 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.470
 tuner radio player cd dvd

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.530
 usb 2 ports usb a sd card port but 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.160
 also and especially the wifi with browser 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.990
 integrated internet below we find 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.760
 the controls of these heaters and 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.490
 driving patterns then to come back 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.110
 briefly at headquarters for having traveled 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.430
 more than 2000 kilometers aboard seven 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.350
 it's the shooting break I can you 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.360
 make sure they offer excellent 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.930
 maintaining thanks to a command 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.430
 lumbar below the controls of 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.130
 bizonal crime and digesting storing with 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.220
 here the screen selection dial 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.220
 tactile 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:04.900
 on the other hand one has 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.420
 main standard equipment on 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.100
 note on this break the help to start 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.720
 in side the aid system to 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.340
 parking with front sensors 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.830
 back without forgetting the rearview camera 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.810
 the drowsiness detection system 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.910
 the risk warning system 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.400
 of collision bound so we have already 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.290
 saw that on the lamps 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.890
 the regulator and the speed limitation 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.050
 navigation the pack amg line without forgetting 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.360
 the blind spot warning device indicated by 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.430
 a small orange triangle in the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.840
 mirrors signal light but 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.410
 also warning sound 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.880
 within the cockpit the volume of the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.470
 chest of this break is slightly 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.289
 superior to that of the coupe to know 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.360
 between 495 and 1340 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.399
 the liter we note the presence of a 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.180
 stock to protect the loading of 

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:51.779
 prying eyes 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.710
 as well as three aluminum rails 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.909
 equipped with rubber pads then 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.539
 concretely it serves for what good it is 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.460
 very simple 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.490
 this prevents your classes from being your 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.899
 luggage to move in the trunk 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.849
