understand about brakes is they're not
fixed<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.009> road<00:00:26.900> there<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.199> many

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
fixed on the road there are many

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.189 
fixed on the road there are many
different<00:00:28.980> types<00:00:29.009> of<00:00:29.460> brake<00:00:29.699> problems

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
different types of brake problems

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.580 
different types of brake problems
there's<00:00:31.199> most<00:00:31.949> trucks<00:00:32.310> use<00:00:32.640> air<00:00:32.970> brakes<00:00:33.240> and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
there's most trucks use air brakes and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.549 
there's most trucks use air brakes and
air<00:00:34.590> brakes<00:00:34.860> require<00:00:35.370> sealed<00:00:36.059> lines

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
air brakes require sealed lines

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
air brakes require sealed lines
oftentimes<00:00:37.559> they'll<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> light<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.760> leak<00:00:39.059> in

oftentimes they'll be a light a leak in

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410 
oftentimes they'll be a light a leak in
a<00:00:39.600> line<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:41.309> sort<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> stuff<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
a line and that sort of stuff is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.920 
a line and that sort of stuff is
supposed<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.739> detected<00:00:44.460> before<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
supposed to be detected before the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.490 
supposed to be detected before the
trucker<00:00:46.170> gets<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> road<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> requirement

is<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.370> what's<00:00:50.789> called<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.120> pre-trip

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
is that they do what's called a pre-trip

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.779 
is that they do what's called a pre-trip
inspection<00:00:52.469> part<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> pre<00:00:53.579> trip

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
inspection part of that pre trip

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.529 
inspection part of that pre trip
inspection<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.809> brakes<00:00:55.789> oftentimes<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
inspection are the brakes oftentimes a
