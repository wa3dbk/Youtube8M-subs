to<00:00:47.309> use<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.670> game<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> figured<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.870> if

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to use in this game I figured just if

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
to use in this game I figured just if
you<00:00:49.890> dual<00:00:50.100> willed<00:00:50.340> any<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> pistols

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you dual willed any of the pistols

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
you dual willed any of the pistols
you're<00:00:51.270> probably<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.710> did<00:00:52.980> try

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you're probably good to go now I did try

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.560 
you're probably good to go now I did try
the<00:00:53.280> automatic<00:00:53.850> pistol<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.420> which

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the automatic pistol I don't know which

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.029 
the automatic pistol I don't know which
one<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> last<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.770> with

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
one it is it's like a last one with

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.549 
one it is it's like a last one with
would<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.390> slap<00:00:57.690> full<00:00:57.960> auto<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
would like you can slap full auto on it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
would like you can slap full auto on it
but<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.129> takes<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.149> many<00:01:00.359> shots<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
but it's it's takes so many shots to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.150 
but it's it's takes so many shots to
kill<00:01:00.960> some<00:01:01.199> money<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> figured<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.829> dual

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
kill some money I figured just dual

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.090 
kill some money I figured just dual
wielding<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.670> much<00:01:02.850> faster<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.710> better<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
wielding so much faster and better and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
wielding so much faster and better and
it<00:01:05.220> kills<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:05.610> quicker<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it kills them quicker but this this is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950 
it kills them quicker but this this is
actually<00:01:08.100> uh<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> best<00:01:09.659> team

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
actually uh probably the best team

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.560 
actually uh probably the best team
deathmatch<00:01:10.549> kill<00:01:11.549> death<00:01:11.729> ratio<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:12.240> gotten

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
deathmatch kill death ratio I've gotten

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.800 
deathmatch kill death ratio I've gotten
so<00:01:12.720> far<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> also<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.250> mean<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> almost<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
so far and also I mean this is almost a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810 
so far and also I mean this is almost a
shutout<00:01:16.080> gameplay<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.130> entire<00:01:17.430> team<00:01:17.700> I

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
anywhere and that's a lot of times while

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.560 
anywhere and that's a lot of times while
I'll<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:31.350> kind<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:32.120> put<00:03:33.120> my<00:03:33.240> attack

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570

helicopter<00:03:34.140> up<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> middle<00:03:34.680> you'll

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
helicopter up in the middle you'll

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500 
helicopter up in the middle you'll
actually<00:03:35.040> see<00:03:35.340> me<00:03:35.490> do<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:35.850> in<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.970> second<00:03:36.360> I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
actually see me do it here in a second I

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.630 
actually see me do it here in a second I
think<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.440> get<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> kill<00:03:37.890> coming<00:03:38.280> up<00:03:38.370> here<00:03:38.520> in<00:03:38.580> a

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
think I get a kill coming up here in a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.000 
think I get a kill coming up here in a
second<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:39.600> like<00:03:39.810> I'll<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.770> put

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
second and then it's like I'll just put

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.410 
second and then it's like I'll just put
it<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.220> middle<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.730> spawns<00:03:42.090> are<00:03:42.270> so

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
it in the middle because a spawns are so

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.540 
it in the middle because a spawns are so
crazy<00:03:42.690> even<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.440> see<00:03:43.650> him<00:03:43.770> spawn<00:03:44.070> trapped<00:03:44.430> on

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
crazy even if I see him spawn trapped on

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.979 
crazy even if I see him spawn trapped on
one<00:03:44.700> side<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> map<00:03:45.300> I'll<00:03:45.480> think<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.840> myself

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
one side of the map I'll think to myself

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.340 
one side of the map I'll think to myself
well<00:03:46.700> it's<00:03:47.700> not<00:03:47.790> gonna<00:03:47.940> matter<00:03:48.180> because<00:03:48.360> by

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
well it's not gonna matter because by

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.680 
well it's not gonna matter because by
the<00:03:49.410> time<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> call<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.400> they're<00:03:51.390> gonna<00:03:51.480> get

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the time I call it in they're gonna get

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.810 
the time I call it in they're gonna get
over<00:03:51.959> there<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.830> spawns<00:03:53.130> are<00:03:53.310> gonna<00:03:53.400> swap

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
over there and the spawns are gonna swap

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.280 
over there and the spawns are gonna swap
up<00:03:54.090> or<00:03:54.270> they're<00:03:54.360> gonna<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.570> right<00:03:54.810> next<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.170> me

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
up or they're gonna be right next to me

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.630 
up or they're gonna be right next to me
so<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.560> kind<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:55.950> put<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.370> middle

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
so I just kind of put it in the middle

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.880 
so I just kind of put it in the middle
like<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:59.510> just<00:04:00.510> put<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.870> there<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.230> run<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
like so I just put it there and run and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.470 
like so I just put it there and run and
right<00:04:02.160> there<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:02.880> if<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.120> look<00:04:03.390> at

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
right there I was like if you look at

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.449 
right there I was like if you look at
the<00:04:03.600> school<00:04:03.900> look<00:04:04.590> at<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.860> forty<00:04:05.250> five

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.040 
the school look at that forty five
hundred<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.910> five<00:04:06.150> hundred<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.660> didn't<00:04:06.930> even

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
hundred to five hundred I didn't even

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.690 
hundred to five hundred I didn't even
realize<00:04:07.380> we<00:04:07.500> were<00:04:07.620> dominate<00:04:08.070> these<00:04:08.190> guys<00:04:08.430> so

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
realize we were dominate these guys so

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.250
