probably going to have the XO boost XO

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.699 
probably going to have the XO boost XO
jumps<00:02:25.790> XO<00:02:26.790> ability<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.599> most<00:02:28.290> likely<00:02:28.409> going

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709

the other hand if they make World War
two<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.349> really<00:02:35.190> do<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:35.549> see<00:02:35.610> how<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.840> exosuit

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
two I really do not see how the exosuit

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.110 
two I really do not see how the exosuit
would<00:02:37.769> make<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> return<00:02:38.340> because<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.000> going

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
would make a return because it's going

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.479 
would make a return because it's going
to<00:02:39.209> be<00:02:39.329> set<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.660> World<00:02:39.870> War<00:02:39.989> two<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.530> obviously

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
to be set in World War two and obviously

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.509 
to be set in World War two and obviously
the<00:02:41.760> technology<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.870> limited<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the technology was limited and so it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.880 
the technology was limited and so it
would<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.849> return<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.890> traditional

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
would be a return to the traditional

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.970 
would be a return to the traditional
call<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.400> duty<00:02:47.760> style<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:49.500> know<00:02:49.620> plain

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
call of duty style so you know plain

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.220 
call of duty style so you know plain
advanced<00:02:50.430> warfare<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.269> really<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.079> playing
