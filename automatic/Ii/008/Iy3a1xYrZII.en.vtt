00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.700
 sogeta 5 online at a point 23 then 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.490
 today we will meet for a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 duplicating glitch of vehicles in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 hand points 24 excuse me then we're going 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.820
 end up for a glyph of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.689
 duplication of vehicles then as 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 you see here 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.510
 my colleague is real budget expensive and 75 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.340
 lent me his armored vehicle so that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.560
 I have blick 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.260
 so I'll do the manipulation then you 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.930
 take a vehicle from your friend he 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 admire access vehicles everyone 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.489
 so that's how you see my garage 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.059
 and I try to show this vehicle 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 not go astray in your garage so the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.610
 mania can be is it a fact well 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.539
 how in the video then you place 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 the vehicle here you go out then just 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.670
 after you go to the street and you 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.950
 go get a lived experience of the street then 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.450
 how much the recover a vehicle from the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:18.230
 street as by chance with the story 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.510
 so vatry leicester for more before the 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.970
 cops I think I think my 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.830
 first text then you take a 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.450
 vehicle from the street and you block the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.350
 passenger door or there you tasted all 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.100
 six months 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.119
 here you take a vehicle from 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.140
 time and you block hop I believe 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.750
 that the vehicle and rothschild 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.780
 in short, it's like that take an experience of the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.340
 Gauthey Street Reporting Passengers 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.280
 Normally that's it you like me 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 you leave in the vehicle like that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.750
 it's good then for the rest of the glitch 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.880
 will you have to buy a karin 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.649
 rebels because they will not rust 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.070
 expensive three thousand $ 3000 so then I 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.680
 am going to buy a frame for berruyers 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.830
 rla then for the rest of this video 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.620
 we will open in activities or 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.350
 so you put like me and you 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.970
 go flat out your urban setting on the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.860
 door of your garage 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.470
 so I specify to make this empty 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.980
 fault this garage it does not work on 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.830
 works 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.010
 then you put the hood of the square of 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.560
 rebels on the garage door you the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.180
 always have to green activities 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.090
 so after you will do but 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.440
 would like to take one to six 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.959
 on my game I advise you and you 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.840
 have managed blow against here so far 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.610
 you see the hood of the engine because 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.739
 catch on fire you'll see 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.519
 here and when the engine will catch fire 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.739
 you have watched well and poultry 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.519
 pro fire and look well at the bottom left 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.010
 and my card 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.360
 there was a flashing act for me 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.160
 to say that my vehicle is destroyed 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.600
 I kept quiet in the vehicle of my 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.810
 friend and manager a few seconds and you 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.670
 go see that the gi joe will work 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.490
 that's when I end up with the lived experience 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.470
 in montmagny 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.430
 my garage like wanted the rich well 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.020
 worked so here we are going to get to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.140
 the autostart to see that we can 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.670
 entry into our offshore areas then 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.940
 the one I do not walk with 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.100
 police vehicles I already tried good 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.780
 you have to find a modder and that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.310
 this is his personal vehicle I think 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.850
 for you to get there or so 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.690
 watch 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.630
 we are with the same how 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.360
 is called even insurgents all terrain 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.970
 or it is the experience of the update 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.790
 so I 'm going to show you that we can 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:52.420
 well their entry into the nine santos 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:55.450
 custom look jobs 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.090
 this is the noise at home I think that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.280
 this mine started just 5 online 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.840
 you can realize it you do 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.880
 of three robberies which of which you have 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:12.840
 because now that we live in 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.840
 So here we go horn 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.980
 our cube action then lighting 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.020
 strike any improvements that the 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.610
 putting them in play is good in pasture 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.960

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.430

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.260
 superimposed 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:42.000
 you're complicated like that 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.930

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.270
