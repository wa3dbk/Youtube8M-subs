Hello, I am The Excelsior Hotel's executive Chinese chef Wong Wing Keung

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:34.481
Today, I am delighted to demonstrate how to create one of our restaurant's most popular desserts, the black and white sesame roll

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:38.459
First, heat up the pan and roast the black sesame

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.459
The white bits you see are white sesame. Why do we add this?

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:47.465
If it's just black sesame, it's difficult to see when the sesame is perfectly roasted.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.329
So, we add the white sesame, and when it browns, then we know that it is done

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.046
Okay, now it is done

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:58.349
In a new pan, roast the white sesame

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.424
When the white sesame darkens, then it is ready

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:10.021
Use a medium heat, because if it gets too hot, you'll burn the sesame

00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.002
Cook it for about five minutes

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:16.136
Now, we're going to blend the black sesame

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:25.962
We have about 80g of black sesame. Add 320g of water

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:30.254
Now, we blend

00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:42.577
After we blend it, we need to run it through a sieve

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:46.191
When that's done, we can throw away the leftover grainy bits

00:01:46.191 --> 00:02:00.857
In the sesame paste, add cream, sugar, water chestnut flour, corn starch, and mix it

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:04.304
When you're done mixing, run it through the sieve again to get rid of any lumps

00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:07.551
Repeat this process with the white sesame

00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:13.184
We sift the mixture twice to ensure the sesame roll has a smooth texture

00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:18.274
To create the first part of the sesame roll, we need a thin layer of black sesame paste on the bottom

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:24.038
Spread it out evenly, covering the entire pan

00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:33.228
Steam it over high heat for two minutes

00:02:33.228 --> 00:02:38.410
Make sure that the pan is laid out flat, or you will get an uneven layer after steaming

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.825
Let the black sesame layer cool before adding a white sesame layer on top

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:45.275
Just spread it out evenly

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:52.197
Oftentimes, restaurants won't use white sesame, and instead substitute it with coconut milk

00:02:52.197 --> 00:03:01.016
We use both black and white sesame because combining them together gives a richer flavour

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:06.331
Carefully take the pan out of the steamer

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:11.226
Now, we will make the sesame roll and start to roll it together

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.345
This is one of Yee Tung Heen's most popular desserts, the black and white sesame roll
