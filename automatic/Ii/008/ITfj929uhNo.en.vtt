that<00:00:10.380> sounds<00:00:10.860> through<00:00:11.010> both<00:00:11.160> units<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.790> once

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that sounds through both units and once

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.030 
that sounds through both units and once
again<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> low-pass<00:00:13.380> filter<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
again with the low-pass filter on the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:25.500 
again with the low-pass filter on the
1700s<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.880> third<00:00:15.440> third<00:00:16.440> demonstration

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:01:00.330 

you

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:50.450 

you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:24.880 

you

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.440 

so<00:02:25.890> both<00:02:26.040> units<00:02:26.370> definitely<00:02:26.820> warmed<00:02:27.150> up<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
so both units definitely warmed up the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.940 
so both units definitely warmed up the
acoustic<00:02:27.840> guitar<00:02:28.110> pretty<00:02:28.350> well<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:28.830> pretty

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
acoustic guitar pretty well it's pretty

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
acoustic guitar pretty well it's pretty
tough<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.480> differentiate<00:02:30.480> which<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.990> is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
tough to differentiate which one is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.640 
tough to differentiate which one is
which<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.590> my<00:02:31.830> opinion<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:33.330> next

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
which in my opinion the next

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.300 
which in my opinion the next
