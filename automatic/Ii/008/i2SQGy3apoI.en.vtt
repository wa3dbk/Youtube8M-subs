00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
when I was going it on so it definitely

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
sense could I take cut the West so

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.710 
sense could I take cut the West so
that's<00:01:25.819> why<00:01:25.970> common<00:01:26.330> sense<00:01:26.509> there<00:01:26.840> um<00:01:27.709> I<00:01:28.720> don't

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720
