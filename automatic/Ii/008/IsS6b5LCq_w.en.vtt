00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.800 

I'm<00:00:02.970> finding<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:03.959> thyroid<00:00:04.830> problems<00:00:05.400> are

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
I'm finding that thyroid problems are

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.650 
I'm finding that thyroid problems are
becoming<00:00:06.810> an<00:00:07.049> increasing<00:00:07.859> problem<00:00:08.069> today

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
becoming an increasing problem today

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.419 
becoming an increasing problem today
part<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> reason<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.530> think<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.070> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
part of the reason I think for that is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.209 
part of the reason I think for that is
the<00:00:12.240> greater<00:00:12.660> amount<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.380> environmental

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the greater amount of environmental

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.910 
the greater amount of environmental
toxicity<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.690> deal<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.080> we

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
toxicity that we have to deal with we

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.500 
toxicity that we have to deal with we
are<00:00:17.039> living<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> most<00:00:18.180> toxic

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
are living in one of the most toxic

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.580 
are living in one of the most toxic
periods<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.560> Earth's<00:00:19.770> history<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:21.590> we're

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
periods in Earth's history and we're

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.500 
periods in Earth's history and we're
dealing<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.010> hundreds<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.880> endocrine

and how would conventional medicine tree
then<00:01:49.670> how<00:01:50.000> would<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.270> treat<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.690> with<00:01:50.870> the

added knowledge of Integrative Medicine

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.440 
added knowledge of Integrative Medicine
well<00:01:54.800> depending<00:01:55.340> on<00:01:55.490> what<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.820> problem<00:01:56.270> is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
well depending on what the problem is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.570 
well depending on what the problem is
conventional<00:01:57.350> medicine<00:01:57.860> would<00:01:58.040> tend<00:01:58.430> to

conventional medicine would tend to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.000 
conventional medicine would tend to
treat<00:01:58.850> more<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.300> symptoms<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.680> for<00:02:00.980> a

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
treat more the symptoms so for a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.980 
treat more the symptoms so for a
diabetic<00:02:01.430> they<00:02:01.880> would<00:02:02.060> give<00:02:02.240> them<00:02:02.450> insulin

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
diabetic they would give them insulin

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.680 
diabetic they would give them insulin
and<00:02:03.230> various<00:02:03.650> drugs<00:02:03.980> for<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.880> thyroid<00:02:05.420> if

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
they do manage to diagnose the problem

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.440 
they do manage to diagnose the problem
they<00:02:09.530> would<00:02:09.740> probably<00:02:10.280> throw<00:02:10.759> somebody<00:02:11.120> on
