00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.130
 We gave notice last week 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.199
 Saturday and the whole area 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.269
 About the production process of animation 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 From the beginning 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.969
 I want to explain to you all day long 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.949
 It was announced the other day 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.050
 Today is 14 stories 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.060
 The prefecture is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.069
 It is anime son 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.739
 It is the work of lightening the basic character of the basic character 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.040
 About Hanshin 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.420
 Of movement 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.420
 Getaway this season 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.320
 It is a job that I have a job 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.540
 This is after all 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.630
 Looking at a live-action film 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.700
 actor 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.770
 It is not to fall in Mao kindergarten 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 In other words, the song whose character is dead and returned to Tokyo after introduction 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 Is it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.650
 think 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.880
 Meanwhile 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.880
 Most of the work is galaxy work 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.460
 Of course the original exhibition 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.640
 It is nice to see you 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 If there are 24 people from Spring on Spring, translation of 1.2 million yen 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.490
 I can not move smoothly without a system, but it is all 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 It wasn't the case, but the decision was made 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.450
 Because I will write using the decided pose in the middle of the slope 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.670
 When it is not hot, there are 56 sheets of 50 sheets and 30 sheets per minute 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.890
 Is also himself 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.760
 Will be there 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.830
 In this way 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.550
 In the case of that Japanese animation 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.820
 Animators are in charge of each scene and draw pictures 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.080
 You 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.080
 In the case of animation in US ophthalmology 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.780
 In fact, I also take it through characters 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.040
 Same character from beginning to end 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.160
 The animator has melted 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.390
 There are many such things 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.050
 By doing this 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.070
 There is a sense of unity in the movement of the character, but in Japan 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.970
 The person in charge who is focused on emerging is decided 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.569
 Distressed and Japanese anime in that case 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.749
 Examination of previous country 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.619
 I wonder if someone was in charge Who wrote this year 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.519
 It carried like that 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.039
 It is individuality or something 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.639
 Because that comes out in various ways 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.419
 I can also enjoy it, but 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.669
 In that case, a sense of unity has not been created in the film 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.479
 Reuse after this will be quite important 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.159
 The job is 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.849
 I'm heavy on football but I want to talk it headed 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.920
 I think
