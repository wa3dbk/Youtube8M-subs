00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 very good to all guys that such as 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 you are welcome to another video more 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 welcome to michael michael channel 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.180
 I am true today we are in 2.0 as 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 We have already seen what I know 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.869
 twitter I bought a new one on camera 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.150
 web I hope it's better than the mobile 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 so, first of all, you are nothing 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.769
 watching the challenge gotcha lens michael what 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.330
 is this and well, this is one thing 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.489
 what video on the channel of alfred may but 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.040
 97 that would have put the title right 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 surely I will have put your twitter to 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.330
 I can see that I have managed to overcome the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.820
 challenge that he established will make a few 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.700
 weeks I think two weeks and then it's 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 something that said if I got it if I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.500
 I got this challenge because I could 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.110
 upload me the breakdowns and I can improve it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.390
 then guys the retoque challenge 'is 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.000
 play in this map map of recovery 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 as we are seeing with the local care 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.670
 with the bots in the recruit difficulty and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.340
 play one against nine is to say duel 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.910
 by teams the nine against you and you have 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 to do in five minutes 135 more casualties 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.979
 of 135 casualties and at the end you will see the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.640
 end of the video that I made about 140 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.740
 low 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 which I when I did demonstrate is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.409
 something that is quite pretty flip 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.750
 and with which, I think it 's molarÃ­a 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.400
 I would climb it because it's something that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 It cost quite a while I was quite a while 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840
 trying it with different weapons with 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.550
 different streaks and in the end then I chose 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 the streaks that you are seeing that are the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.300
 v the b52 universe that is a bomber 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.979
 the word beer and the last one is the drone of 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.690
 attack all this 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.930
 manipulated by the guide is to say by the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.940
 own game because it is something that kills it 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.770
 very much if you take it as you can 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.290
 kill and that is something that makes you lose 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.979
 time with which is something not to me 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.420
 I did not like it then I tried it with him with 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.970
 the driver of the guide as I said 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 previously and it is something that has 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.239
 come pretty good 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.670
 It has been something quite pretty 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.560
 collection some form and you will see that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.380
 I also took out one I had obviously in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.709
 recruit but I have to tell you guys 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.269
 that even if they are recruits, it is something that is 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.190
 quite difficult because all the bots 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.019
 in recruits are going to go for you and in 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.030
 advanced warfighter bots 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.000
 they are usually more difficult than for example 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.620
 the data the black ops 1 in ghosts 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.390
 Also, you can see that here they are a little 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.700
 smarter to say it of some 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 way and it's something because the truth 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.330
 it cost quite a lot for example now 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 you are seeing that I am almost red to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560
 about to die trying to go here 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.989
 for all I already have all the streaks a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.220
 Again, here, love, you see, there's 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.629
 jumping to DNA is something 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.209
 it is something that makes it more difficult not to leave 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.010
 especially the east change of the map 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.720
 because every time you have to move you have 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.970
 that move the backup you have to 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 try not to get killed and that's something 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.750
 it can be quite quite complicated and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.819
 above all they are very lucky at the time 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.799
 that since I've done what I 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.420
 said before not that they do not kill you with what 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.579
 which guys that's the challenge of the boat 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.920
 aliens that is as if it was the challenge of 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.409
 God, in a way, and it's something that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.180
 when he did it was sniper cost him 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.120
 I quite remember that he recorded up to 4 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.010
 6 hours and everyone to a bestiality thing 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.590
 alpha if you are seeing right now the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.690
 video or I tell you that I congratulate you 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.730
 because we're going to record four hours 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.160
 this is that it is insufferable I did 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.319
 three or four games and we were already going 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.329
 even backwards because it was 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.989
 something quite difficult especially in this 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.640
 map but the good thing is that you need 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.010
 have a little more concentration there is 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.019
 to know why it is what areas there are that 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.060
 watch but we 'll see 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.099
 that I 'm hanging around the map 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.769
 with which it is something that is not done 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.540
 pretty boring to see the gameplay not 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.110
 it's something pretty pretty handsome so 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.230
 less in me 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.390
 personal opinion and it's something that 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.780
 everything I say is going to see michael you have taken out 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.810
 the challenge has taken 140 casualties you have the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.580
 a new webcam that was ban 2.0 with 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.890
 which is what I have done the truth to me 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.780
 I like it a lot doing this this 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.240
 kind of videos that always sound an 2.0 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.329
 although I have not done many but that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.030
 something that I like I do not know I like it 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.010
 that yes is a challenge because the good thing of the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.840
 challenges is that there are always people 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.460
 competitive that is to say I have all done 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.550
 so many casualties because I have to do more 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.560
 with which I here, guys, I challenge you to 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.140
 all of you because this challenge is for 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.730
 all the people not only do it alpha 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.640
 and he says do it yourselves but 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.410
 everyone can decide that oa 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.669
 everyone who is watching this video 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.780
 I challenge you to shoot local to put recruits 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.970
 good what you have seen at the beginning 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.100
 of the video puts that kind of options 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.010
 Customized in the game of recruits 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.640
 where the bots go and try to get the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.350
 more than 140 casualties 135 not 140 because I 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.780
 I have taken 140 and see if any of 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.830
 you who get 100 more out of 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.980
 140 casualties 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.100
 to 140 jousting nailed because I would like 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.410
 know it and especially since the see then 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.700
 that I am good because for example I in 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.380
 this call of duty I am not actions that 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.890
 be very good with which having me 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.500
 removed this I like quite 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.630
 I liked it a lot if you are watching 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.520
 I've already had about 137 casualties 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.160
 point of getting it if I get them in 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.440
 extremis guys 140 casualties there at the 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.880
 victory they obviously kill me twice and 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.920
 So here I hope you guys have 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.930
 liked here today's video 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.670
