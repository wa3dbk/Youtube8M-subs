 should the oil filter be tightened to the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.769
 hand or key it is written on the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.809
 filter June 8 clean the June scope 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.439
 or vice and until close contact 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:25.320
 three quarter turn 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:27.539
 check the tightness rotating motor 4 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 numbers from 1 to 4 are entered on the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.359
 outline of the filter they serve as benchmarks 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.359
 during tightening 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.370
 if your filter does not have these four 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.050
 markers you can score four 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.050
 numbers on the filter outline 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.900
 oil the June 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.060
 or vice and by hand until contact 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.060
 the number listed above is noted 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.950
 ceret the three-digit filter to 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.010
 from the figure that is entered in 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.200
 above 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.120
 in the video the number 4 is written 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:14.599
 above must tighten up 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:15.709
 numbers number three if the filter is not 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.299
 not very accessible 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.280
 or if you do not have a lot of strength 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.750
 in the hands the hand tightening does not 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.120
 will not be possible you can use 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.439
 a filter wrench to finish greenhouse 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.540
 and three quarter turn if you do not 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.709
 do not tighten enough you risk 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.239
 lose engine oil turning if 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.799
 you squeeze too much you will have 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.669
 difficulties in unscrewing 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.669
 next replacement 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.500
 it does not matter whether you are in the hand or 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.120
 at the key the important thing is greenhouse and 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.120
 three quarters of a turn after contact 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.100
 this 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.690
 Yes
