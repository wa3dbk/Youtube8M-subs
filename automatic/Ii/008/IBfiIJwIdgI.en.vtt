specters<00:00:26.550> drives<00:00:27.269> something<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.990> truly

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
specters drives something that truly

gives you a better experience gives you
a<00:00:30.689> unique<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:31.320> decide<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.700> makes<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
a unique or decide and really makes the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
a unique or decide and really makes the
right<00:00:33.570> trade-offs<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.710> premium<00:00:35.070> user

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
right trade-offs for a very premium user

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
right trade-offs for a very premium user
so<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.719> call<00:00:36.989> out

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so the first things that I call out

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
would be you have Gorilla Glass so the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.889 
would be you have Gorilla Glass so the
same<00:00:40.620> durable<00:00:41.340> material<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.329> on

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
very high end cell phones you have that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
very high end cell phones you have that
on<00:00:45.270> three<00:00:45.539> surfaces<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on three surfaces so you have it on the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.950 
on three surfaces so you have it on the
back<00:00:47.010> panel<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.059> unique<00:00:48.539> we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
have it on the inside panel and you also

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.220 
have it on the inside panel and you also
have<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> keyboard<00:00:54.510> back<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> very

you that really premium look and feel
the<00:01:00.930> other<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the other thing is if you look at the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
the other thing is if you look at the
panel<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.850> mounted<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.420> panel<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> way<00:01:04.229> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
panel we mounted the panel in a way that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 
panel we mounted the panel in a way that
we<00:01:04.619> took<00:01:04.799> away<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> over<00:01:06.000> head

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
we took away a lot of the over head

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
we took away a lot of the over head
around<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.200> very<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.680> tight

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
around it so it's a very very tight

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.780 
around it so it's a very very tight
integration<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.299> small<00:01:09.570> borders

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
integration very very small borders

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.910 
integration very very small borders
and<00:01:10.850> it's<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.120> very<00:01:11.150> bright<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.050> vivid<00:01:12.290> panel

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
and it's a very bright and vivid panel

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.860 
and it's a very bright and vivid panel
and<00:01:13.370> it<00:01:13.520> also<00:01:13.670> has<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.910> higher<00:01:14.090> resolution<00:01:14.420> so

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
and it also has a higher resolution so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.500 
and it also has a higher resolution so
it's<00:01:15.020> 1600<00:01:15.650> x<00:01:15.770> 900<00:01:16.010> so<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.910> gives<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> lot

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
it's 1600 x 900 so it gives you a lot

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.940 
it's 1600 x 900 so it gives you a lot
more<00:01:17.570> real<00:01:18.140> estate<00:01:18.170> than<00:01:18.650> what<00:01:18.770> you're<00:01:18.920> used

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
more real estate than what you're used

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.820 
more real estate than what you're used
to<00:01:19.340> getting<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.270> standard<00:01:20.990> ultraportable

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
to getting on a standard ultraportable

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.950 
to getting on a standard ultraportable
it<00:01:22.640> also<00:01:22.760> has<00:01:22.970> things<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.420> keyboard<00:01:23.780> diet

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it also has things on the keyboard diet

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.050 
it also has things on the keyboard diet
names<00:01:24.230> I'm<00:01:24.560> here<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:25.070> look<00:01:25.370> at<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.640> backlit
