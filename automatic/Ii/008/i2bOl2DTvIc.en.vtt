00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.179
 a last dlc a gift of self to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.080
 king rock big koning as it's called 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.869
 How are you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.920
 I'm completely sexy 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.090
 here I was not speaking alone I 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.519
 wanted to leave the doubt to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 people who whistle and parsley and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.099
 actually it's been a long time since 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.270
 had not made a video both 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.110
 many of you have asked 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.309
 what was going on and he focused on it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.660
 speak little actually but for life in 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.460
 his steps in fact we are pretending 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 but also on the quarantine map she 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.600
 is called that's it yes that's it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.800
 there is I tested a little dlc 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 since I had to wait until it was 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 with that it makes his connection sparrows 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.840
 and that's downloading all the dlc 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 so I had time to go around 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 and I want to say that of the four 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 maps this is the one that for now I 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.840
 prefer 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 that's it's just me I'm going 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.760
 Understand nothing 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.930
 yeah but that's a general in the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.840
 life no but I 'm lost and everything is going 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.049

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.480
 research what to tackle 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.190
 I took the sb at it looks like 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.410
 basin level that turns out a little bit more 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.880
 original info that no longer deceive 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.000
 too much people like that dragon's of 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.920
 dragon or the new drama simply 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 does treat the same thing that I have 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.019
 took that for what 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.269
 because I wanted to see you 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.720

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.950
 Thermal walrus r I got 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.090

 do not play tonight for a while 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.980
 I think it existed the same 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.209
 worst I think since the last dlc 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.310
 I was not long 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.510
 mills ends so at the same time they 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.790
 did they announce it only the week 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.870
 last to AIDS last week but 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 jarry some dlc they say nothing of that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.630
 I would say that he will have nothing left 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.940
 to fuck the whore jura it's true that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.130

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 fault on the other 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.530
 fish had served to sexy photos 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.329

 long time to visit at I want to 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.880
 specify for the people who would have it 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.360
 the misplaced spirit 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.620
 the lady is a trip to the whore at 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.450
 the accolade to the name williams brought back from 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.370
 beautiful museums but of course but 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.870
 attention but I know your love for 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.139
 for paintings 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.060
 yes that's victor hugo and my family 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.139
 a strong pole 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.289
 victor hugo is really the painter that 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.620
 I prefer I mean if we look 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.610
 the painters of the eighteenth to whom he jumped 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.810
 at the same time but it has to be 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.539
 nostradamus mme boutin victor hugo is 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.729
 a very very pretty painter very much 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.260
 not too good because there yes very nice 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.389
 a very nice devil but that's the gal 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.910
 come to reveal his sexuality to the I am 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.770
 out of the closet 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.330
 I confess all the spit the piece or r2 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.539
 well he does proceed this is the case of the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.820
 say 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.440
 patrick alain proux better there because 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.229
 that in fact the ground collapses 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.880
 precisely the ground really collapsed 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.340
 to accede we can still climb on 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.650
 the tree like a little monkey lario promised 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.169
 we spit on the tree if you see 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.099
 I love my clothes already nothing 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.210
 just for the fact that we can 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.720
 climbing on the bsaa is worth it 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.720
 to buy the dlc 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.470
 go sold in pharmacy and the publ 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.069
 bought the dlc otherwise it will not sell 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.680
 she moves back 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:07.889
 olala entrusts him the svb to step you imagine 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.449
 to assume clip there input but that he 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.449
 Please, this is going to be a trick 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.020
 go again no I'll go up in 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.250
 the tree so we do not get up in 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.530
 the street I will rather make myself full 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.650
 of friends every morning at the latest is 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:28.710
 I had the cua shot online sales 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:30.750
 mouths what are you buggering at the bag if 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.080
 we look at it's you fucking see the 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.430
 gorgeous island range saks bravo that 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.909
 so little assessment of this map that is 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.060
 what you think 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.889
 it's the kick the go 18 thing what good 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.110
 go away and that's the gap is 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.520
 hit something in the middle it's a bit 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.449
 like a map hood but with 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.389
 different colors to they are not 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.560
 really this dog never have times 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.849
 better than that is how they 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.590
 invent stuff of exactly 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.990
 exactly the only animation that's it 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.919
 it's the thing that falls but frankly 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.090
 I find this map there she is pretty 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.500
 in colors and overall 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.990
 she plays well the dynamics is good 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.310
 so so here's so thank you for 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.840

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.520
