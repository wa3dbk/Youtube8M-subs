00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.160
 Welcome to the way to 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.110
 non-smoking number 25 is me 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.670
 So now I just read the parties 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.230
 I think I recorded 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.880
 I do not like the coach 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.290
 In addition, this would somehow still be 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.300
 to make it afterwards only with it time 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.369
 completely on youtube I'm sorry 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.029
 but it should be all right now 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.650
 function 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.780
 I really have quite a few 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.910
 get news with assistance 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.590
 and so on and so forth and that should 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.790
 continue now I have it first 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.030
 tried rendering 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.470
 that went pretty well and takes some time 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.000
 a bit longer I think must be 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.690
 make a mess tomorrow or something like that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.640
 is really corrosive 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.710
 I have too much shit on it 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.780
 So that 's a bit sad though 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.580
 no matter background black ops 1 I have 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.140
 Yesterday I really wanted to play 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.820
 One we show two I had one 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.699
 types replied as comment halt 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.360
 but yesterday I've got mw2 I was there 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.250
 stop in the kiga konfi and with the with the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.140
 robert and the ruble have themselves 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.030
 upset and such and I thought there is coming 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.990
 I'll tell you a few in mw2 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.880
 people tearing apart that did not work that way 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.280
 Alright , I'm almost there again 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.260
 used cigarette so that was real 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.640
 pretty stressful because hacker wegs 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.980
 have taken place I'm already one 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.390
 bit aco that was really that 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.910
 i was sad resident i could give 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.680
 really do not play only full of hackers 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.660
 has I've just forfeited because 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.760
 I'm pretty rough on gp2 and stressed 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.140
 were going to go so do me 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.910
 sorry m2 I think so first 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.830
 do not bring because so that on the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.480
 place du soleil but not player 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.040
 is that you just can not do that 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.470
 can not play this game anymore 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.870
 on the place that is so etched you are 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.580
 not the whole shot down around the corner 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.620
 you will I do not know you love 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.030
 somewhere on the butt of the world with freezing cold 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.670
 and the types do not kill you when you're in 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.900
 The ac is so seriously 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.250
 sad that the all black ops 1 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.350
 underwent 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.330
 The camp is disgusting as a joke that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.979
 I have been here before 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.000
 such great gameplay counts with me 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.860
 not really in it 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.810
 the game is very good again and that 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.640
 gameplay you have to go back then 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.239
 torn apart thought so old 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.099
 this time you go out here I flowed out 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.700
 would require this or so I have yes 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.319
 actually already 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.090
 So he'll just see us 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.410
 just ridiculous I will therefore 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.400
 moritz always point out if that 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.300
 death is coming 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.890
 Well, well worth 25 cents everything goes well 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.530
 as usual I have five days left 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.790
 fall that means five days before he is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.440
 just a bit stupid as the saying 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.670
 would would actually so 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.290
 as if I have now ranked fifth 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 immediately grab the cigarettes 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.100
 but I would not myself but five 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.760
 days now officially has on 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.110
 youtube then I always stop 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.300
 upload and so on and so forth 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.980
 I even thought about it when we did 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.790
 I 've got the 30 days full 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.490
 everything so loaded 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.040
 I will meet you once a week 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.090
 or maybe once a month I know 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.140
 nich you can write to me that the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.120
 i might have loved it maybe i could 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.130
 So I'm actually rather for 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.450
 one for a once a month knows 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.099
 not even the week is we like that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.760
 Often no idea of â€‹â€‹the case changes 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.560
 not much 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.569
 one month I might have even 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.520
 Better not give any feedback because of 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.349
 he ran pretty well in the month or today 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.239
 that I started smoking again 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.610
 although it is actually quite good me 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.989
 I have to say I really essential 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.330
 worse presented essential 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.920
 worse because I have it otherwise 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.420
 never tried it right now i have it now 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.150
 a device yes come on you stop now 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.560
 and so on then stop but am 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.880
 next morning will go directly to the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.410
 tender mate took a cigarette and 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.310
 I smoked again that's me 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.810
 I never think so 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.209
 I really tried I think 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.250
 really a two day was made for me 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.020
 if anything but now I know that 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.480
 the 25 days already doing that is 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.520
 actually pretty good and me 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.110
 thought that I myself get seizures 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.220
 have just as I do not smoke because I do 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.760
 I already believe mine now 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.720
 two years or so smoke so 2 I am 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.760
 now 18 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.700
 maybe even three years I 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.140
 So I started around 14 15 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.200
 to smoke in between times 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.420
 No idea in any case , I thought 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.459
 first that that you are going to parcours 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.319
 So somehow it was because I scrape off 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.819
 a real if I have ever been for 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.440
 So let's say a month now 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.849
 back because I do not have an hour 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.829
 have smoked or two hours then 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.440
 I was a bit angry like that 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.360
 that was a bit of a meal 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 well so i feel like i said i 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.020
 well i am really surprised that it is so 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.860
 it is going on well 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.930
 That's why I think I 'll be strong too 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 remain so after some 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.330
 written that I maybe 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.400
 my mum should say that on the way 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.510
 should be good for eyes first 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.620
 me, because I will no longer 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.340
 Cigarette does not grab me here 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.250
 wants to sue 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.360
 and that's good for her too, that's me 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.740
 do not know that maybe you know too 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.390
 when your parents smoke the say 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.860
 just no I smoke already legendary 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.830

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.970
 Models already 20 years or so 15 years 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.890

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.910
 really long in any case the wants 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.860
 not even when she does 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.960
 just as necessary in life you know that 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.460
