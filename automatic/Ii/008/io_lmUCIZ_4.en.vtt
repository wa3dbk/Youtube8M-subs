in<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.480> brain<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:11.890> causing<00:01:12.280> someone<00:01:12.520> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
in the brain that is causing someone a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.750 
in the brain that is causing someone a
very<00:01:14.080> severe<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:14.620> devastating<00:01:15.100> stroke<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
very severe and devastating stroke the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.150 
very severe and devastating stroke the
other<00:01:15.910> thing<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.390> also<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.160> very

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
other thing is I also is a very

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.430 
other thing is I also is a very
impressed<00:01:18.610> by<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.760> idea<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.440> clot-busting

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
impressed by the idea that clot-busting

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.890 
impressed by the idea that clot-busting
drugs<00:01:20.770> thrombolytics<00:01:21.640> come<00:01:22.090> on<00:01:22.180> buster<00:01:22.600> drugs

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
drugs thrombolytics come on buster drugs

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.140 
drugs thrombolytics come on buster drugs
that<00:01:23.500> normally<00:01:23.860> we<00:01:23.980> only<00:01:24.010> give<00:01:24.430> intravenously

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
that normally we only give intravenously

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.420 
that normally we only give intravenously
and<00:01:25.390> can<00:01:25.570> cause<00:01:25.780> side<00:01:26.020> effects<00:01:26.410> that<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:27.340> are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
and can cause side effects that you are

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.370 
and can cause side effects that you are
actually<00:01:27.820> able<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.210> deliver<00:01:29.080> those

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
actually able to deliver those

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.620 
actually able to deliver those
clot-busting<00:01:30.100> drugs<00:01:30.340> right<00:01:30.850> into<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.390> brain

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
clot-busting drugs right into the brain

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.390 
clot-busting drugs right into the brain
with<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.870> catheter<00:01:32.110> right<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.680> brain<00:01:32.890> yeah

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
with a catheter right in the brain yeah

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.220 
with a catheter right in the brain yeah
that's<00:01:33.640> true<00:01:33.880> acute<00:01:34.540> stroke<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.900> one<00:01:35.050> of<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
that's true acute stroke is one of the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.340 
that's true acute stroke is one of the
biggest<00:01:35.580> challenges<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.700> we<00:01:36.790> face<00:01:37.000> I<00:01:37.350> think

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
biggest challenges that we face I think

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.200 
biggest challenges that we face I think
in<00:01:38.500> healthcare<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.790> third<00:01:39.820> leading

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
in healthcare it's the third leading

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.180 
in healthcare it's the third leading
killer<00:01:40.480> in<00:01:40.690> America<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.710> second<00:01:42.040> leading

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
killer in America the second leading

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.630 
killer in America the second leading
killer<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.330> world<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.840> an<00:01:44.650> up<00:01:44.830> until<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
killer in the world and an up until the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.130 
killer in the world and an up until the
last<00:01:45.790> decade<00:01:46.270> or<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:46.540> we<00:01:46.660> didn't<00:01:46.900> have<00:01:46.930> many

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
last decade or so we didn't have many

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.200 
last decade or so we didn't have many
options<00:01:47.350> we<00:01:48.010> could<00:01:48.280> give<00:01:48.700> intravenous

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
options we could give intravenous

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.760 
options we could give intravenous
thrombolysis<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:49.990> we<00:01:50.050> still<00:01:50.260> do<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.560> it's<00:01:50.710> a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
thrombolysis and we still do that it's a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.130 
thrombolysis and we still do that it's a
standard<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.160> care<00:01:51.660> for<00:01:52.660> patients<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:53.050> come

standard of care for patients that come

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.990 
standard of care for patients that come
in<00:01:53.320> in<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.830> timely<00:01:54.040> fashion<00:01:54.190> within<00:01:54.760> three

it's anything that that's one of the

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's anything that that's one of the
problems<00:02:15.909> you<00:02:16.209> don't<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.510> woken<00:02:16.689> up<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.230> you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
problems you don't get woken up so you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.809 
problems you don't get woken up so you
know<00:02:17.799> out<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.040> your<00:02:18.159> sleep<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.640> end<00:02:18.760> up

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
know out of your sleep so you end up

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.800 
know out of your sleep so you end up
sleeping<00:02:19.030> through<00:02:19.390> your<00:02:19.510> straw

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
sleeping through your straw

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.620 
sleeping through your straw
can<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.650> often<00:02:20.770> we<00:02:21.040> don't<00:02:21.069> really<00:02:21.610> know<00:02:21.970> when

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
can and often we don't really know when

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.970 
can and often we don't really know when
your<00:02:22.870> stroke<00:02:23.140> started<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.709> you're<00:02:23.860> not

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
your stroke started so you're not

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.250 
your stroke started so you're not
eligible<00:02:24.220> for<00:02:24.459> many<00:02:24.760> treatments<00:02:25.239> that's<00:02:26.080> one

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
eligible for many treatments that's one

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.600 
eligible for many treatments that's one
of<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.410> problems<00:02:26.500> yeah<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.099> mean<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.489> other

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
of the problems yeah I mean the other

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.430 
of the problems yeah I mean the other
problem<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.180> people<00:02:28.360> don't<00:02:28.840> really<00:02:29.110> know

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
problem is that people don't really know

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.260 
problem is that people don't really know
what<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.860> symptoms<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.550> stroke<00:02:30.610> are<00:02:31.000> as<00:02:31.150> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
what the symptoms of a stroke are as you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.260 
what the symptoms of a stroke are as you
say<00:02:31.510> numbness<00:02:32.500> or<00:02:32.800> speech<00:02:33.099> difficulty<00:02:33.790> or

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
say numbness or speech difficulty or

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.479 
say numbness or speech difficulty or
minor<00:02:35.230> fur<00:02:35.500> alisis<00:02:35.860> which<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.130> often<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
minor fur alisis which is often the

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.920 
minor fur alisis which is often the
warning<00:02:36.819> sign<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.239> strokes<00:02:37.480> coming<00:02:37.780> on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
warning sign that if strokes coming on

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.920 
warning sign that if strokes coming on
often<00:02:38.920> get<00:02:39.160> attributed<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.540> know<00:02:40.690> being

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
often get attributed to you know being

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.170 
often get attributed to you know being
tired<00:02:41.170> too<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:42.010> know<00:02:42.130> maybe<00:02:42.489> my<00:02:42.700> arm<00:02:42.880> falling

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
tired too you know maybe my arm falling

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.930 
tired too you know maybe my arm falling
asleep<00:02:43.660> right<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.280> don't<00:02:45.700> come

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
asleep right and and so you don't come

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.580 
asleep right and and so you don't come
right<00:02:46.120> away<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.810> kind<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.110> wait<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.470> then

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
right away you you kind of wait and then

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.770 
right away you you kind of wait and then
only<00:02:47.769> when<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.130> becomes<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.550> full-blown<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.750> oh

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
only when it becomes a full-blown or oh

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.350 
only when it becomes a full-blown or oh
now<00:02:50.140> I'm<00:02:50.319> paralyzed<00:02:50.860> do<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.819> come<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.239> that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
now I'm paralyzed do you come and that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.809 
now I'm paralyzed do you come and that
often<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.530> late<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.980> i<00:02:54.430> think<00:02:54.610> that

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
often it can be late and i think that

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.930 
often it can be late and i think that
the<00:02:55.060> interventional<00:02:56.019> options<00:02:56.920> are<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.880> a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the interventional options are in a

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.370 
the interventional options are in a
prolonged<00:02:58.299> window<00:02:58.569> we<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:58.959> them<00:02:59.140> up<00:02:59.260> to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
prolonged window we can do them up to

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.860 
prolonged window we can do them up to
six<00:02:59.590> hours<00:02:59.970> we're<00:03:00.970> fda-approved<00:03:01.360> out<00:03:01.750> to

six hours we're fda-approved out to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.449 
six hours we're fda-approved out to
eight<00:03:02.019> hours<00:03:02.049> with<00:03:02.560> several<00:03:02.890> different<00:03:03.250> tools

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
eight hours with several different tools

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.140 
eight hours with several different tools
and<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:03.850> have<00:03:04.000> an<00:03:04.120> opportunity<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:05.019> know<00:03:05.140> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and we have an opportunity you know to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.940 
and we have an opportunity you know to
reverse<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.840> blockage<00:03:08.260> remove<00:03:08.799> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
reverse the the blockage remove the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.039 
reverse the the blockage remove the
blockage<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.519> restore<00:03:09.880> blood<00:03:10.000> flow<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.599> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
blockage and restore blood flow to the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.559 
blockage and restore blood flow to the
brain<00:03:11.170> there's<00:03:11.980> also<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.489> penumbra<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
brain there's also the penumbra the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.420 
brain there's also the penumbra the
penumbra<00:03:13.900> cafeteria<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.830> essentially<00:03:15.310> it's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
penumbra cafeteria is essentially it's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.190 
penumbra cafeteria is essentially it's
like<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> vacuum<00:03:15.880> pairs<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.360> suction<00:03:16.720> catheter

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
like a vacuum pairs of suction catheter

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.110 
like a vacuum pairs of suction catheter
they<00:03:17.590> developed<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.069> little<00:03:18.190> wire<00:03:18.519> with<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:18.880> bead

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
they developed a little wire with a bead

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.559 
they developed a little wire with a bead
on<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.470> which<00:03:20.760> essentially<00:03:21.760> unplugs<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
on it which essentially unplugs the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.580 
on it which essentially unplugs the
catholic<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.110> problem<00:03:23.380> we<00:03:23.470> were<00:03:23.560> having

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
catholic it's the problem we were having

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.410 
catholic it's the problem we were having
with<00:03:23.920> suction<00:03:24.130> catheters<00:03:24.730> before<00:03:25.150> was<00:03:25.390> that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
with suction catheters before was that

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.360 
with suction catheters before was that
they<00:03:25.630> would<00:03:25.720> get<00:03:25.900> plugged<00:03:26.650> up<00:03:26.799> with<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> clock

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
they would get plugged up with the clock

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.270 
they would get plugged up with the clock
we<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.060> start<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.359> vacuum<00:03:28.780> up<00:03:28.959> clots<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.739> in

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
we can start to vacuum up clots in in

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.930 
we can start to vacuum up clots in in
the<00:03:30.730> vacuuming<00:03:31.299> up<00:03:31.480> cloths<00:03:32.260> out<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.709> my<00:03:32.859> brain

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
the vacuuming up cloths out of my brain

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.830 
the vacuuming up cloths out of my brain
basking<00:03:33.940> them<00:03:34.060> out<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.390> locally

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
basking them out and locally

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.020 
basking them out and locally
administered<00:03:34.959> thrombolytics<00:03:35.829> right<00:03:36.489> just

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
administered thrombolytics right just

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.699 
administered thrombolytics right just
imagine<00:03:37.269> what<00:03:37.569> they'll<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:38.109> two<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.680> four

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
imagine what they'll be in two to four

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.680 
imagine what they'll be in two to four
more<00:03:39.190> years<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:40.120> it's<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.359> think<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
more years I think it's I think it I

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.330 
more years I think it's I think it I
think<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:41.079> an<00:03:41.140> exciting<00:03:41.530> time<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.769> medicine

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
think it's an exciting time in medicine
