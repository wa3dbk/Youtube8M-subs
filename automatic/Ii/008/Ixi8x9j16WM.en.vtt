this particular case so we've got a lot

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.439 
this particular case so we've got a lot
to<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.539> video<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.019> let's<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.350> started

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
to do in this video so let's get started

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
to do in this video so let's get started
which<00:00:27.449> cuts<00:00:28.230> through<00:00:28.910> sides<00:00:31.130> just<00:00:32.130> try<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
which cuts through sides just try it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
which cuts through sides just try it
top<00:00:32.790> off<00:00:37.640> try<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> take<00:00:39.000> too<00:00:39.210> much<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.390> your

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
top off try to take too much of your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:49.340 
top off try to take too much of your
time<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:40.020> doing<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:47.780> there<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.989> go

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
time when doing this there we go

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
time when doing this there we go
right<00:00:56.120> now<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.480> still<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:58.280> when<00:00:59.280> there's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
right now I still think when there's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.709 
right now I still think when there's
only<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.789> person<00:01:00.859> taking<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> case<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.719> still

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
only one person taking a case out still

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.310 
only one person taking a case out still
think<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> easiest<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:05.299> flip<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:07.340> case

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
think the easiest way to flip a case

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.300 
think the easiest way to flip a case
upside<00:01:10.320> down<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:15.740> other<00:01:16.740> people<00:01:16.950> have

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
upside down and then other people have

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.870 
upside down and then other people have
other<00:01:17.430> methods<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.580> works<00:01:20.580> for

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
other methods but this is what works for

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.790 
other methods but this is what works for
me<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:22.170> comes<00:01:22.439> camera<00:01:22.880> hey<00:01:23.880> guys

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.020 

and<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:30.920> was<00:01:31.010> quite<00:01:31.159> lucky<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.610> ceilings

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
and that was quite lucky the ceilings

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.870 
and that was quite lucky the ceilings
almost<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:33.170> tall<00:01:33.500> enough<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.860> get<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.670> box

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
almost not tall enough to get the box

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.320 
almost not tall enough to get the box
off<00:01:35.060> then<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.520> let's<00:01:37.520> get<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> right<00:01:38.000> way

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
off then so let's get it the right way

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.700 
off then so let's get it the right way
up

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.390 

take<00:01:45.710> some<00:01:45.890> polystyrene<00:01:46.430> protection<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.060> and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
take some polystyrene protection of and

00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:01.690 
take some polystyrene protection of and
in<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.759> bottom<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:59.470> that's<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.830> product<00:02:01.490> out

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
in the bottom and that's the product out

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.980 
in the bottom and that's the product out
of<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.240> box<00:02:04.180> okay<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.509> worth<00:02:05.690> mentioning

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
of the box okay so it's worth mentioning

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.740 
of the box okay so it's worth mentioning
that<00:02:06.289> behind<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.520> Corsair<00:02:09.700> 550d<00:02:10.700> which<00:02:11.570> is

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that behind is the Corsair 550d which is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.729 
that behind is the Corsair 550d which is
another<00:02:12.100> silent<00:02:13.390> case<00:02:14.390> which<00:02:15.290> actually<00:02:15.620> looks

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
another silent case which actually looks

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.740 
another silent case which actually looks
very<00:02:15.980> similar<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.550> one<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:17.000> notice<00:02:17.510> them

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
very similar to this one but notice them

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.890 
very similar to this one but notice them
you<00:02:18.410> get<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:18.709> protective<00:02:19.519> case<00:02:19.760> enough<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
you get this protective case enough and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.710 
you get this protective case enough and
we'll<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.769> closer<00:02:22.220> look<00:02:22.430> at<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.209> case

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
we'll have a closer look at the case

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.530 
we'll have a closer look at the case
itself

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.790 

on<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> top<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.110> worth<00:02:31.260> mentioning<00:02:31.470> that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
on the top it's worth mentioning that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.300 
on the top it's worth mentioning that
you<00:02:32.069> get<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.120> assume<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.959> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
you get your I assume it's going to be a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
you get your I assume it's going to be a
an<00:02:35.310> installation<00:02:35.970> guide<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.420> 330<00:02:36.959> are

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
an installation guide for the 330 are

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
an installation guide for the 330 are
and<00:02:37.530> perhaps<00:02:37.709> like<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> warranty<00:02:38.700> manual

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and perhaps like a warranty manual

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.540 
and perhaps like a warranty manual
inside<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:40.770> well<00:02:40.980> such<00:02:41.220> as<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.430> that

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.120 
front of the case if I if you guys can
see<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:08.130> get<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.959> front<00:03:09.959> panel<00:03:10.290> which<00:03:10.410> hinges

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
see you get the front panel which hinges

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.160 
see you get the front panel which hinges
out<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.209> put<00:03:12.300> your<00:03:12.330> drive<00:03:12.600> bays<00:03:12.930> in

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
out and you can put your drive bays in

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.860 
out and you can put your drive bays in
there<00:03:13.590> which<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.250> very<00:03:14.640> similar<00:03:14.970> feature<00:03:15.420> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
there which is a very similar feature to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.009 
there which is a very similar feature to
what<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.400> other<00:03:17.400> Corsair<00:03:17.940> case<00:03:18.150> does<00:03:18.450> as<00:03:18.930> you

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
what the other Corsair case does as you

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.440 
what the other Corsair case does as you
can<00:03:19.200> see<00:03:19.290> where<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.530> front<00:03:19.760> opens<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.120> again

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
can see where the front opens and again

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.030 
can see where the front opens and again
it<00:03:21.540> opens<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> other<00:03:22.080> way<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.500> need<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
it opens the other way if you need it to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.430 
it opens the other way if you need it to
you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.910> actually<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.390> pull<00:03:24.630> from<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
you can actually just pull from the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.220 
you can actually just pull from the
other<00:03:25.560> side<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:26.420> or<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.570> hinged<00:03:27.930> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
other side I think or is it hinged that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.160 
other side I think or is it hinged that
side<00:03:29.209> okay<00:03:30.209> now<00:03:30.239> we<00:03:30.510> might<00:03:30.630> need<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> swap<00:03:31.050> it

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
side okay now we might need to swap it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.640 
side okay now we might need to swap it
over

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
over

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.160 
over
but<00:03:32.340> basically<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:32.910> stick<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.079> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
but basically you can stick it on to the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.400 
but basically you can stick it on to the
other<00:03:34.320> side<00:03:34.590> instead<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.750> should<00:03:36.930> hinge

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
other side instead and it should hinge

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.979 
other side instead and it should hinge
off<00:03:37.620> you've<00:03:37.769> got<00:03:37.890> your<00:03:38.130> front<00:03:38.850> fan<00:03:39.329> filter<00:03:39.840> and
