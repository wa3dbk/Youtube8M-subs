00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.350
 it wishes the jams welcome again 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.099
 a new player fell review today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 wine hero card from game play I have 7 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.059
 caught around and I don't know what 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.410
 I think of it, it will be 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.330
 still clear in this review he 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 has scored 16 times in seven games and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.820
 3s hissed in video you see an old tasty 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 gryce whose of 120 room that maximum 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 for can go and goes in charge 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.420
 for a few stats that really hurt him 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.429
 stand out that they are shooting 87 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 of course and i have to say you notice 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.120
 also that is so good but only 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.410
 you don't stick to the good shooting yet 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.739
 a lot of it he has one too 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.270
 shot power of 92 and that is really whole 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 very noticeable and that is really a whole 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.719
 good condition on them card that 's one of them 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 the best things that you actually are out of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.800
 He also has a card 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.899
 good placement 75 on them but they card 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.460
 kind of parsing is actually much better 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.210
 then i've noticed that's real 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.370
 a lot 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.360
 yes attack has actually started and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.190
 has been able to score so many goals 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.289
 without actually having them 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.940
 to score 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.469
 something else that I find very cool 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.879
 to the cards that purple is just like 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 every purple from this is not a first 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.970
 just how fat but it is also very smart 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.830
 of that one because it is so intended 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 ensured that everyone got them coins for team 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 precise and format two golden purple 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.830
 cards hsa once i could unfortunately 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 bacon unsightly today keel 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.299
 see today make one as well as real 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.520
 insane I agree with that so delicious 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.930
 the got didn't really have the 16 goals 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.909
 in seven matches he has not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.680
 in my opinion deserved recap of the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.549
 seven games I have played 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 I made 9 goals in 2 matches 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 yes and you know there were just two whole ones 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.049
 four matches but also score 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.549
 that one maybe twice a 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.500
 contest 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.479
 very good on the menu and maybe also 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.960
 best on the card sweet x one 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.270
 slope is the jumping has 82 jumping 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.649
 and she them thing is also spacious and the 80 so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 therefore he really has one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.130
 yes he does n't have to be fast and that's it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.740
 disadvantage to his card, I think he is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 is not very fast with its 870 face 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.729
 he very few yes bpl defenders 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.770
 passed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.049
 bundesliga still manages to top tag 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.850
 and the nation yes there are still difficult though 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.829
 for example badstuber and then to there 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.210
 he comes along but he comes further 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.340
 actually not along the defense 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.710
 do n't have a break uv like them that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.000
 to mention 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.850
 yes with which you really pass the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.010
 defenders that print and just the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.780
 can come along but what I did them 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.980
 and I noticed the first few law 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.420
 seems that it didn't go so well because 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.160
 I tried to go through the middle with 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.900
 I started playing him through the flanks 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.700
 last moment and I saw him just after 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 did you see it whole before heading 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.700
 forest in dress video because i just 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.440
 too many coursing clips was around it 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 all in the video of three and a half 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.670
 minute it stops and I want more 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.870
 put clips in the video but then 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.430
 you have no commentary the bee 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.270
 because I do n't know what I have six minutes 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.590
 longer 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.620
 say things about the card except 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.480
 then that he is there so our mass he is 122k 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 he is not very expensive so and so real 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.140
 clearly better than other cards 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.220
 wants to pick him up and I'd say do it 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.650
 it because I feel like it 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.710
 preiser in game goes up and sat at 80 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 cate mission yesterday to 120 kg upgrade 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.080
 and so it could be that today 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.390
 So 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.580
 or tomorrow or next week to another 150 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.620
 or maybe 200k goes in this case 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.790
 I hope he likes this video 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.200
 so in a little sympathy must choose 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.820
 people 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.010
 hopefully your selfie will be perfect 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.800
 witnesses aroused quite another 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.110
 hopefully you now have nice refraction 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.580
 of aldo men or the match messi en know 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.050

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.820
 respect and then to train now 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.410
 list for television short paul 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.000
 shooting and heading well I have 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.410
 explained why and the only thing after the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.180
 but could find that he wasn't whole 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.890
 fast is plus there may still be possible 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.750
 actually also the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.490
 dribbling at which is of course 80 on the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.050
 card market that is just not entirely 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.610
 nice to look in your grave is videos 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.570

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.960
