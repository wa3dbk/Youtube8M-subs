00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
you're gonna want to get up to this part

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.340 
you're gonna want to get up to this part
blow<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.880> hidden<00:02:02.880> shell<00:02:03.420> thing<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.230> then

walk<00:02:04.590> down<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.490> use<00:02:05.850> Sirena<00:02:06.360> scream<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
walk down here and use Sirena scream to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.980 
walk down here and use Sirena scream to
break<00:02:07.350> open<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.550> another<00:02:09.450> mini<00:02:09.720> kits

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
break open this to get another mini kits

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.500 
break open this to get another mini kits
that<00:02:10.380> would<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> seventh<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.150> video

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that would be the seventh in this video

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
that would be the seventh in this video
and<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:12.990> going<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> want<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.410> push

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and then you're going to want to push

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:24.400 
and then you're going to want to push
this<00:02:14.130> crates<00:02:14.610> forward

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.770 

and<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:25.130> use<00:02:25.310> someone's<00:02:25.850> projectile<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and then use someone's projectile to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.600

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
shoot the mini kid open so you can

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.660

collect<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.170> ninth<00:02:30.830> one<00:02:31.130> will<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.460> out

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
collect it and the ninth one will be out

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.190 
collect it and the ninth one will be out
here<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.150> you're<00:02:32.270> gonna<00:02:32.360> need<00:02:32.600> someone<00:02:33.020> with

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
here and you're gonna need someone with

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.400 
here and you're gonna need someone with
super<00:02:33.530> jump<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.220> there<00:02:35.180> are<00:02:35.510> some<00:02:35.990> very

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
super jump to get it there are some very

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.740 
super jump to get it there are some very
useful<00:02:36.650> studs<00:02:37.220> on<00:02:37.430> both<00:02:37.610> sides<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.600> get

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
useful studs on both sides of it so get

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.080 
useful studs on both sides of it so get
those<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.200> want<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:40.940> is

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
those if you want to and this is

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.940 
those if you want to and this is
actually<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> little<00:02:41.600> bit<00:02:41.720> tricky<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.410> get<00:02:42.770> you

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
actually a little bit tricky to get you

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.580 
actually a little bit tricky to get you
kind<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.220> have<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.480> jump<00:02:44.480> weirdly<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.320> don't

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
kind of have to jump weirdly I don't

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.400 
kind of have to jump weirdly I don't
know<00:02:45.680> it's<00:02:46.270> kind<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.330> it's<00:02:47.690> badly<00:02:48.170> designed

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
know it's kind of it's badly designed

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.980 
know it's kind of it's badly designed
but<00:02:49.070> jump<00:02:49.520> up<00:02:49.670> there<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.510> will<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
but jump up there and there will be the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.570 
but jump up there and there will be the
mini<00:02:51.140> gate<00:02:51.320> now<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.920> looks<00:02:52.070> like<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> tenth

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
mini gate now that looks like the tenth

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.150 
mini gate now that looks like the tenth
one<00:02:52.790> but<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.390> actual<00:02:54.080> tenth<00:02:54.440> one<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.010> this

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
one but the actual tenth one is in this

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.280 
one but the actual tenth one is in this
room<00:02:55.400> where<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.760> need<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> turn<00:02:56.570> these<00:02:56.900> wheels

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
room where you need to turn these wheels

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.380 
room where you need to turn these wheels
until<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.160> mini<00:02:58.340> kit<00:02:58.520> appears<00:02:58.880> there<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.300> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
until the mini kit appears there in the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.450 
until the mini kit appears there in the
middle<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.900> I'm<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.590> really<00:03:00.830> sure<00:03:00.950> what

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
middle and I'm not really sure what

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.610 
middle and I'm not really sure what
order<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> has<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.390> be<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:02.990> never<00:03:03.410> been

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
order it has to be in I have never been

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.020 
order it has to be in I have never been
able<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.860> figure<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.250> out<00:03:04.370> all<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.580> know<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.910> that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
able to figure it out all I know is that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.210 
able to figure it out all I know is that
the<00:03:05.120> mini<00:03:05.300> kit<00:03:05.540> will<00:03:05.690> randomly<00:03:06.230> appear<00:03:06.830> when

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
the mini kit will randomly appear when

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.190 
the mini kit will randomly appear when
you<00:03:07.250> turn<00:03:07.850> those<00:03:08.000> wheels<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.690> up<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:08.990> I<00:03:09.020> don't

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
you turn those wheels and up so I don't

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.630 
you turn those wheels and up so I don't
know<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.710> certain<00:03:10.160> amount<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.460> times

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
know if it's a certain amount of times

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.300 
know if it's a certain amount of times
or<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.450> those<00:03:11.990> plates<00:03:12.410> actually<00:03:12.710> have<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.190> be

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
or that those plates actually have to be

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.850 
or that those plates actually have to be
in<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:13.610> pattern
