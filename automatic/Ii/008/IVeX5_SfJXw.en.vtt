00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
of liked on the dr but it seemed a
little<00:01:14.220> long<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> should<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.600> dr

little long I think you should just dr
with<00:01:16.049> itself<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.070> would<00:01:17.159> encourage

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
with itself and it would encourage

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
with itself and it would encourage
switching<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.740> that's<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.890> my

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
switching more but that's just my

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.330
