in<00:00:36.450> jelly<00:00:36.719> bro<00:00:36.960> cm10<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> all<00:00:39.030> three<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
in jelly bro cm10 so all three of the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.590 
in jelly bro cm10 so all three of the
same<00:00:39.840> sort<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.460> ROM<00:00:41.460> running<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> custom<00:00:42.239> kernel

same sort of ROM running a custom kernel

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
same sort of ROM running a custom kernel
on<00:00:42.870> each<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.370> Galaxy<00:00:44.760> Nexus<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.270> actually

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
on each and the Galaxy Nexus is actually

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.560 
on each and the Galaxy Nexus is actually
it<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.590> its<00:00:46.800> GPU<00:00:47.399> overclocked<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.180> well<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it has its GPU overclocked as well to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
it has its GPU overclocked as well to
512<00:00:49.410> megahertz<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.690> 307<00:00:51.690> or<00:00:51.809> 303<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
512 megahertz from 307 or 303 so that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
512 megahertz from 307 or 303 so that
should<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.960> sort

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
should you know that's that's the sort

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.380 
should you know that's that's the sort
of<00:00:55.199> most<00:00:55.410> stable<00:00:55.920> version<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.489> could<00:00:56.640> find<00:00:56.969> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of most stable version I could find in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
of most stable version I could find in
terms<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.170> comfortable<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> phones<00:00:59.129> will

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
terms of how comfortable the phones will

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340 
terms of how comfortable the phones will
run<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.000> battery<00:01:00.180> life's<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
run the battery life's really good and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
run the battery life's really good and
eat<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.949> three<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.899> even

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
eat on all three of them actually even

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.859 
eat on all three of them actually even
with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> high<00:01:04.939> overclock<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
with the high overclock because of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
with the high overclock because of
installed<00:01:07.350> CPUs<00:01:07.830> buying<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.280> three<00:01:08.430> devices

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
installed CPUs buying all three devices

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660 
installed CPUs buying all three devices
and<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.450> actually<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.320> most<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.070> deep<00:01:11.280> sleep<00:01:11.430> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and it actually is most in deep sleep so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.310 
and it actually is most in deep sleep so
the<00:01:11.729> kernels<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.840> good<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the kernels are really really good and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.390 
the kernels are really really good and
working<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.430> well<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.250> wanted<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
working really well but I'm I wanted to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.859 
working really well but I'm I wanted to
do<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> comparison<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.570> there's<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
do this comparison because there's a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.679 
do this comparison because there's a
couple<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> show<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
couple of things I want to show you and

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
couple of things I want to show you and
I'm<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> start<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.350> quadrant<00:01:22.950> first

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
I'm going to start with quadrant first

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.749 
I'm going to start with quadrant first
on<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.970> three<00:01:24.270> devices<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> those<00:01:26.189> quadrant

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
on all three devices and those quadrant

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.230 
on all three devices and those quadrant
here<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.920> I'm<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.250> run<00:01:29.400> quadrant<00:01:30.119> on

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
here and I'm going to run quadrant on

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
here and I'm going to run quadrant on
all<00:01:30.360> three<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> i'm<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> skip<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
all three and i'm not going to skip this

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
all three and i'm not going to skip this
time<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:33.630> whole<00:01:33.900> benchmarking<00:01:34.799> process<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
time the whole benchmarking process is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
time the whole benchmarking process is
actually<00:01:35.280> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.670> show<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> something<00:01:36.210> on

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
actually want to show you something on

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.830 
actually want to show you something on
the<00:01:36.720> nexus<00:01:37.170> 7<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.240> i'm<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> run<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the nexus 7 so i'm going to run the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
the nexus 7 so i'm going to run the
benchmark<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.710> three<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:43.460> i'm<00:01:44.460> just

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
benchmark on all three and i'm just

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.219 
benchmark on all three and i'm just
going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> sit<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.479> wait<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> obviously

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
going to sit here and wait and obviously

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
going to sit here and wait and obviously
the<00:01:46.979> nexus<00:01:47.729> s<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.090> expect<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.630> finish<00:01:48.810> last<00:01:52.520> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the nexus s i expect to finish last and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
the nexus s i expect to finish last and
you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.240> evolution<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you can really see the evolution of the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.620 
you can really see the evolution of the

by samsung the one on the left is met by
Zeus<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:10.069> then<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.090> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
Zeus and then really this is what I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.920 
Zeus and then really this is what I
wanted<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.629> bring<00:02:13.140> up<00:02:13.410> here

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
wanted to bring up here

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.420 
wanted to bring up here
look<00:02:14.109> at<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> frame<00:02:14.680> rate<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.189> that's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
look at the frame rate if that's

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.970 
look at the frame rate if that's
possible<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:16.180> runs<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.689> hundreds<00:02:17.319> there

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
possible it runs in the hundreds there

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.599 
possible it runs in the hundreds there
you<00:02:18.040> go<00:02:18.750> 95-88<00:02:19.750> hundred<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.650> three<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.370> that

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
you go 95-88 hundred and three and that

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.539 
you go 95-88 hundred and three and that
is<00:02:21.810> every<00:02:22.810> time<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.079> run<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.500> test<00:02:23.799> even<00:02:24.189> other

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
is every time I run this test even other

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.690 
is every time I run this test even other
ones<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.480> runs<00:02:25.719> at<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> hundred<00:02:26.370> frames<00:02:27.370> per

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
above 65 and also the nexus s i'm just

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.300 
above 65 and also the nexus s i'm just
going<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> wait<00:02:41.439> for<00:02:41.469> it<00:02:41.769> again<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.189> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
going to wait for it again to the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.300 
going to wait for it again to the
graphics<00:02:42.730> testing<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.389> the<00:02:44.189> nexus<00:02:45.189> is

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
graphics testing and the nexus is

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.869 
graphics testing and the nexus is
finished<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.109> a<00:02:47.139> nexus<00:02:47.530> 7<00:02:47.889> you<00:02:48.459> can<00:02:48.669> see

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
finished and so is a nexus 7 you can see

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.619 
finished and so is a nexus 7 you can see
it<00:02:49.150> runs<00:02:49.510> still<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.079> quite<00:02:50.439> high<00:02:50.650> frame<00:02:50.950> rate

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
it runs still at quite high frame rate

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.379 
it runs still at quite high frame rate
it<00:02:52.629> has<00:02:52.840> about<00:02:53.019> 60<00:02:53.709> s<00:02:53.769> let's<00:02:54.760> see<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:55.090> we<00:02:55.239> can

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
it has about 60 s let's see if we can

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:02.099 
it has about 60 s let's see if we can
focus<00:02:55.629> on<00:02:56.019> now<00:02:56.340> yeah<00:02:58.739> 6530<00:02:59.739> here<00:03:00.810> bottom<00:03:01.810> it

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
focus on now yeah 6530 here bottom it

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.890 
focus on now yeah 6530 here bottom it
gets<00:03:02.379> up<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.590> about<00:03:02.739> 60<00:03:03.280> frames<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:07.389> do<00:03:07.599> get

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
gets up to about 60 frames you do get

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.869 
gets up to about 60 frames you do get
the<00:03:08.049> odd<00:03:08.169> starter<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:08.889> it's<00:03:09.129> expected<00:03:09.700> when

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
the odd starter but it's expected when

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.550 
the odd starter but it's expected when
we<00:03:09.939> device<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.419> old<00:03:10.659> but<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.049> can<00:03:11.200> see<00:03:11.379> here

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
we device this old but you can see here

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.360 
we device this old but you can see here

benchmarks and the reason I've done this

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.290 
benchmarks and the reason I've done this
benchmark<00:07:19.160> comparison<00:07:19.700> with<00:07:19.820> overclocked

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
benchmark comparison with overclocked

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.200 
benchmark comparison with overclocked
processors<00:07:20.840> and<00:07:20.990> the<00:07:21.080> same<00:07:21.460> rom<00:07:22.460> is<00:07:22.730> to<00:07:23.000> just

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
processors and the same rom is to just

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.850 
processors and the same rom is to just
illustrate<00:07:23.420> how<00:07:23.870> good<00:07:24.080> android<00:07:24.410> is<00:07:24.560> and<00:07:24.740> how

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
illustrate how good android is and how

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.160 
illustrate how good android is and how
much<00:07:25.130> you<00:07:26.000> can<00:07:26.210> actually<00:07:26.540> do<00:07:26.720> and<00:07:26.930> how<00:07:27.110> many

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.170 
much you can actually do and how many

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.710 
much you can actually do and how many
sort<00:07:28.070> of<00:07:28.180> customizations<00:07:29.180> there<00:07:29.390> are<00:07:29.570> in

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
sort of customizations there are in

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.570 
sort of customizations there are in
terms<00:07:29.960> of<00:07:30.080> kernels<00:07:30.590> in<00:07:30.740> terms<00:07:30.950> of<00:07:31.040> processor

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
terms of kernels in terms of processor

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.580 
terms of kernels in terms of processor
speeds<00:07:31.910> and<00:07:32.150> you<00:07:32.600> know<00:07:32.690> how<00:07:32.870> well<00:07:33.410> the

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
speeds and you know how well the

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.330 
speeds and you know how well the
developer<00:07:34.040> community<00:07:34.430> works<00:07:34.700> and<00:07:36.040> how<00:07:37.040> great

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340 
developer community works and how great

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.730 
developer community works and how great
the<00:07:37.700> sort<00:07:37.940> of<00:07:38.000> the<00:07:38.270> options<00:07:38.990> for<00:07:39.050> this<00:07:39.290> island

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 
the sort of the options for this island

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.770 
the sort of the options for this island
and<00:07:39.980> what<00:07:40.370> can<00:07:40.820> be<00:07:40.940> done<00:07:41.120> with<00:07:41.180> these<00:07:41.420> devices

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
and what can be done with these devices

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.540 
and what can be done with these devices
in<00:07:42.110> terms<00:07:42.290> of<00:07:42.410> custom<00:07:42.740> roms<00:07:42.950> and<00:07:43.190> stuff<00:07:43.400> like

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550 
in terms of custom roms and stuff like

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.600 
in terms of custom roms and stuff like
that<00:07:43.610> so<00:07:43.990> you<00:07:44.990> know<00:07:45.140> I<00:07:45.170> use<00:07:45.650> these<00:07:45.860> phones<00:07:46.310> at

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
that so you know I use these phones at

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.360 
that so you know I use these phones at
this<00:07:47.000> actual<00:07:47.560> clock<00:07:48.560> speed<00:07:48.860> so<00:07:48.950> I<00:07:49.010> don't<00:07:49.190> just

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.370 
this actual clock speed so I don't just

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.980 
this actual clock speed so I don't just
put<00:07:49.850> it<00:07:49.940> up<00:07:50.090> for<00:07:50.330> the<00:07:50.420> set<00:07:50.630> sake<00:07:50.840> of<00:07:50.870> the

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
put it up for the set sake of the

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.050 
put it up for the set sake of the
benchmark<00:07:51.470> I<00:07:51.650> actually<00:07:51.890> have<00:07:52.280> the<00:07:52.550> Galaxy

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.060 
benchmark I actually have the Galaxy

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.300 
benchmark I actually have the Galaxy
Nexus<00:07:54.020> running<00:07:54.560> at<00:07:54.680> this<00:07:54.800> speed<00:07:55.070> I<00:07:55.100> actually

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310 
Nexus running at this speed I actually

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.890 
Nexus running at this speed I actually
have<00:07:55.580> the<00:07:55.700> nexus<00:07:56.000> 7<00:07:56.300> running<00:07:56.540> and<00:07:56.690> the<00:07:56.780> other

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:56.900 
have the nexus 7 running and the other

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.200 
have the nexus 7 running and the other
speed<00:07:57.230> so<00:07:57.560> I<00:07:57.890> actually<00:07:58.190> keep<00:07:58.520> the<00:07:58.640> devices<00:07:59.090> at

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.210 
speed so I actually keep the devices at

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.000 
speed so I actually keep the devices at
that<00:07:59.420> because<00:07:59.990> they're<00:08:00.380> sort<00:08:00.650> of<00:08:00.710> at<00:08:00.830> the

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.010 
that because they're sort of at the

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.570 
that because they're sort of at the
limit<00:08:01.730> of<00:08:01.940> the<00:08:02.630> of<00:08:03.620> the<00:08:03.800> device<00:08:04.070> but<00:08:04.310> still

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.580 
limit of the of the device but still

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.120 
limit of the of the device but still
daily<00:08:05.390> usable<00:08:05.810> and<00:08:05.930> stable<00:08:06.410> and<00:08:06.590> no<00:08:06.770> problems

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.130 
daily usable and stable and no problems

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.130 
daily usable and stable and no problems
at<00:08:07.220> all<00:08:07.340> so<00:08:08.210> again<00:08:08.450> thank<00:08:08.750> you<00:08:08.810> very<00:08:08.990> much<00:08:09.110> for
