exercise<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.040> north<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:25.520> we're<00:01:26.180> gonna

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
exercise for the north now we're gonna

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:36.060 
exercise for the north now we're gonna
go<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.570> down<00:01:27.460> back<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.520> pavement<00:01:29.240> back<00:01:29.570> on

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.830 

200<00:01:37.070> miles<00:01:37.220> an<00:01:37.399> hour<00:01:37.490> maybe<00:01:37.729> push<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:38.270> 50<00:01:38.660> as

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
200 miles an hour maybe push it to 50 as

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.840 
200 miles an hour maybe push it to 50 as
they<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:39.229> closer<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.890> storm<00:01:40.160> grows<00:01:40.460> and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
they get closer to the storm grows and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.330 
they get closer to the storm grows and
so<00:01:41.240> does<00:01:41.420> their<00:01:41.600> sense<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:42.140> its<00:01:42.440> deadly<00:01:42.890> intent

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
so does their sense of its deadly intent

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.490 
so does their sense of its deadly intent
it's<00:01:43.640> probably<00:01:44.180> gonna<00:01:44.270> miss<00:01:44.450> em<00:01:44.660> but<00:01:44.930> if<00:01:45.410> it

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
it's probably gonna miss em but if it

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.600 
it's probably gonna miss em but if it
comes<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.860> trellis<00:01:46.160> or<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.430> kill

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
comes to that trellis or to kill

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.100 
comes to that trellis or to kill
hundreds<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:46.970> people<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.509> moments<00:01:47.990> the
