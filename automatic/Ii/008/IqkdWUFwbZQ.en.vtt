00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.400
 I greet with you again Sergei booth and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.250
 Now we are in this longer video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.309
 the lesson will analyze the key rules of power 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.070
 how to eat in order to be comfortable 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.379
 lose weight and so let's see 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.490
 on the mechanism and hunger and saturation 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.920
 so that you are more understandable nasa 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 the brain in the hypothalamus is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 small small department head 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.369
 brain which controls bodily 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.170
 functions there are two centers there is a center 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.170
 hunger is the center of saturation 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.200
 here are the centers of hunger constantly active he 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.200
 all the time gives some impulse from 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.200
 the center of saturation is activated then when 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.289
 we ate 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.870
 so here is a review every three to four 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:58.109
 hours when a person fails when a person 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.750
 there is no food in the stomach when there is no well or 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.329
 less nutrients blood center 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.460
 saturation not overwhelm the center of hunger 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.619
 hunger center shows its activity 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.320
 we feel hunger and in principle should 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.740
 eat it thats normal 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.650
 overweight people 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.710
 in the morning they began to barely barely and for 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.770
 there is no food all day 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 there is no hunger 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.340
 starts to accumulate 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.200
 this irritation center hunger 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.700
 becomes very big very strong and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 during the day a person can ignore 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 this hunger not to notice the cocktail 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.930
 dismiss him well what happens 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.810
 in the evening when we got home 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.490
 to the kitchen 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.070
 hunger still makes itself felt and gives 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.799
 know very much and at this time when 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.680
 accumulated such a big big hunger 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:59.219
 happens uncontrollable can 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.290
 say gluttony why because for 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.240
 now that quiet the centers of hunger 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.790
 need that patients 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.450
 lighting but strong enough it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.580
 presented 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 and here at that moment on to the center of saturation 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 becomes active for that you need 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.950
 time until the stomach squeaks 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.280
 it will suck the blood from the intestine until 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.170
 nutrients will appear in the blood 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.530
 while the receptors perceive what's in 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.959
 blood is and chemical element from food 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.209
 not only in the stomach until saturation 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.890
 it will become completely solid because 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.360
 there are also mechanical components 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.600
 chemically , here passes the time and 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.069
 it is at this time that usually happens 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.140
 a large intake of food here such 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.660
 evening zhor just because during 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:54.110
 days have accumulated a cold what to do 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.110
 even with 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.500
 why because when it does 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.450
 much candy and split meals 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.190
 allows 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.110
 whole seems like food more but on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.720
 in fact, in sum, I am getting a lot 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.739
 less than one time twice 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.470
 eating and so again 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.730
 split meals regular meals 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.209
 several times a day 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.549
 although 345 may be six for 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.269
 helps in general to eat much less 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.370
 more than one nutritional risk on 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.230
 this data 5 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.459
 we end I suggest to see 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.220
 down there is under video a link to 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.720
 free recipes tips as you can 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.909
 lose weight and and then it 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.090
 maintain and subscribe total 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.090
