00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.440
 not these villas here we are once again 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.410
 on my channel and I come to bring you a 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:13.180
 tutorial on how to record games 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.230
 xbox 360 in xgd3 format x genres like this 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.169
 that what good first thing to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.489
 to do is to enter a page of 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.489
 video game downloads 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 james torrents I use it is already 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
 then you put in there is also for 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 computer and such but hey this is going to be 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.440
 of equipment and for example this that you are 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440
 watching here 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.800
 you are going to download torrents and for that you 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 is going to need the mourning that is this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 program here to download and such 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.989
 How good when I have downloaded 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.989
 where you have to go is to download 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.470
 here are downloads 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.189
 for example what is perceived 13 I have 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.189
 here all the files 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 It is a program that you have to have 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.590
 you give all 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.550
 and you give to extract here our 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.330
 files those files 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.660
 this is all to extract the iso from 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.730
 disk to record and brings 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.830
 example on the desktop and you will be created 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.940
 a folder that you put fifa for example 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.530
 13 such 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:45.970
 and I'm going to take a moment for you to see 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.890
 with fifa 13 not because with 13 it is not 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.290
 that version and I have but not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.580
 would be a folder type is this is 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.880
 the denied to 13 that also 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.360
 would be a folder like this with these 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.460
 two files 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.460
 you need this program to see 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.509
 a bg x 360 and wii 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.319
 in this program what you have to do 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.340
 it's here in auto flix laws level 3 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.600
 and put him 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.810
 he made it from him 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.340
 of the nba for example 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.430
 if it 's from another game, because the iso 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.020
 approach is downloaded so I do not 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.110
 you go here in search 13 taltal and the iso 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.940
 you are going to open that is level 3 let you 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.620
 WHO 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.370
 and here he will put you if the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.319
 game and such 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.190
 and when it's finished when there's 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.230
 finished cutting the disk already 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.490
 you can record this is to harvest it myself 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.319
 I take it off because I have everything done 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.730
 what you have to do now would be with 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.780
 the imgburn with this all the programs 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.740
 I'm going to leave the description because 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.950
 you download us it would basically be record 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.140
 and maximum disk and here you have to put 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.990
 the dvd the dv file 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.060
 but before burning or recording the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.120
 disc what you have to do is open 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.860
 and see in l'air break if it's double 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.209
 which is 213 35 20 is that the xgd3 format 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.400
 therefore it is the last and if it comes out 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.569
 another expensive number I remember how it was 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.959
 190 degree of something 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.670
 It is the old format with which 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.580
 you have to put another combination 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.340
 good the breeze here the dvd file this 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.770
 and the rectal herb so what do you have 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.500
 what to do is in settings 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.500
 where it puts to record to calculate the optimum 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.510
 if it were xg of 2 if I would put this number 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:03.379
 you will have to give him here to calculate the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.890
 specified and put this number 191 37 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.480
 60 but how is xgd3 that we get this 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.959
 right number calculate the optimal 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.860
 accept and put an album what 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.049
 recommendable is styled with 4 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.720
 but hey I almost always recorded at 8 and 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.489
 the discs are going well and here you have to 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.930
 leave I think they were to verify that you 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.330
 a tick goes out so you have to 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.639
 take it off 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.220
 and if you have a double layer disc and have 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.039
 put in the computer or will come here the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.199
 option to record and good and there would be 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.599
 to do nothing else you will give to record and 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.789
 you would already see the disk so good 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.919
 it's very simple what happens is that it's a 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.569
 practice base once you have 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.210
 recorded two or three discs and others 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.470
 they leave you alone 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.910
 so I hope you liked it 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.979
 in the favorite X for more 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.400
 tutorials and see you the next video 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.400
 goodbye
