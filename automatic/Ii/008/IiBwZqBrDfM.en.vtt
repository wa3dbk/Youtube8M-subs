00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
something's at work here yeah and it's a

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.480 
something's at work here yeah and it's a
fair<00:05:48.570> question<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.260> but<00:05:49.650> I<00:05:49.680> won't<00:05:49.889> he<00:05:50.159> kind<00:05:50.400> of

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
fair question and but I won't he kind of

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.480 
fair question and but I won't he kind of
he<00:05:50.760> briskly<00:05:51.180> understandably<00:05:52.139> so<00:05:52.470> I<00:05:52.860> just

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
he briskly understandably so I just

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.719 
he briskly understandably so I just
think<00:05:53.729> that<00:05:54.199> he's<00:05:55.199> maybe<00:05:55.470> up<00:05:56.099> this<00:05:56.490> is<00:05:56.610> me

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
think that he's maybe up this is me

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.790 
think that he's maybe up this is me
reading<00:05:56.940> into<00:05:57.210> this<00:05:57.240> pure<00:05:57.720> speculation<00:05:57.960> he

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
reading into this pure speculation he

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.439 
reading into this pure speculation he
reads<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.190> stuff<00:05:59.430> that's<00:05:59.610> out<00:05:59.729> there<00:05:59.970> or<00:06:00.120> at

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
reads the stuff that's out there or at

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.000 
reads the stuff that's out there or at
least<00:06:00.659> he<00:06:00.750> has<00:06:00.870> somebody<00:06:01.050> telling<00:06:01.409> him<00:06:01.650> hey

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
least he has somebody telling him hey

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.510 
least he has somebody telling him hey
this<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.460> perception<00:06:03.050> nationally<00:06:04.050> uh<00:06:04.520> you

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
this is the perception nationally uh you

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.770 
this is the perception nationally uh you
know<00:06:05.610> ten<00:06:05.880> years<00:06:06.090> ago<00:06:06.240> maybe<00:06:06.539> you<00:06:06.659> would<00:06:06.750> have

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
know ten years ago maybe you would have

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.300 
know ten years ago maybe you would have
been<00:06:06.900> in<00:06:06.960> line<00:06:07.199> for<00:06:07.229> a<00:06:07.500> job<00:06:07.770> it's<00:06:08.070> odd<00:06:08.280> that

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
been in line for a job it's odd that

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.820 
been in line for a job it's odd that
you're<00:06:08.639> 57<00:06:09.030> turning<00:06:09.690> 58<00:06:10.110> in<00:06:10.289> June<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.710> you're

you're 57 turning 58 in June and you're

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.219 
you're 57 turning 58 in June and you're

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
just getting your first job and but

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.439 
just getting your first job and but
that's<00:06:13.409> a<00:06:13.530> fair<00:06:13.800> line<00:06:14.010> of<00:06:14.159> courtroom<00:06:14.909> yeah<00:06:15.240> and

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
that's a fair line of courtroom yeah and

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.210 
that's a fair line of courtroom yeah and
and<00:06:15.720> he<00:06:15.870> answered<00:06:16.169> it<00:06:16.289> too<00:06:16.470> it's<00:06:16.830> not<00:06:16.979> like<00:06:17.099> he

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
and he answered it too it's not like he

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.350 
and he answered it too it's not like he
dodged<00:06:17.400> oh<00:06:17.639> I<00:06:17.669> don't<00:06:17.909> know<00:06:18.030> anything<00:06:18.240> like

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
dodged oh I don't know anything like

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.420 
dodged oh I don't know anything like
that<00:06:18.479> you're<00:06:18.780> so<00:06:18.960> glaring<00:06:19.289> like<00:06:19.530> it<00:06:19.740> yeah<00:06:20.130> and

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
that you're so glaring like it yeah and

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.310 
that you're so glaring like it yeah and
I<00:06:20.520> think<00:06:20.970> that<00:06:21.150> is<00:06:21.330> part<00:06:21.539> of<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.750> he<00:06:22.050> doesn't

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
I think that is part of it he doesn't

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.839 
I think that is part of it he doesn't
like<00:06:22.470> maybe<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.159> narrative<00:06:23.520> that's<00:06:23.610> being

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
like maybe the narrative that's being

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.089 
like maybe the narrative that's being
painted<00:06:24.150> of<00:06:24.539> him<00:06:24.810> national<00:06:25.080> Cristal<00:06:25.710> no<00:06:25.889> clue

painted of him national Cristal no clue

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.310 
painted of him national Cristal no clue
