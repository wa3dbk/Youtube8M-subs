00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.790
 I'm a Rodrigo, and today is a day of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.550
 a box to follow look we only have here if not 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.280
 is bad earpiece whom say ye that I am 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.109
 the king asked of sleep also in the blue 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.060
 and this is the number 640 xl that currently 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.380
 the date on which this video is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.430
 filmed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 is the best microsoft device with 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.579
 microsoft lugo is the rest are to use 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.370
 phones that still use the nokia brand 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.290
 certainly others will come later that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 It is interesting that it has a screen of 5 with 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.200
 seven inches is big who has 1 gb 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.570
 of ram and what I think is cool he has 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430
 those windows phone tapes that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 sometimes I see gadgets do not see another 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.079
 which is from the owe schweik of two touches in the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 screen to activate and have English are 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 those nice notifications in a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 part of the skin hired off 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.989
 the box is square and define a lot of son 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.510
 even interesting with the smartphone of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.310
 white background this is the white on the side 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 in that soft light 640 xl there is 1 640 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.869
 sensation xl that is smaller has the camera 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.369
 front 11 less good and I know you have a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 cool front camera with camera 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.939
 3 megapixel rear and optic ice 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.740
 old cause but that's the bottom that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.810
 talk a little waste 1 gb of 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.070
 ram 8GB internal memory can 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.049
 be answered with micro sd and clear at 13 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.689
 megapixels with rear flash and 5 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.780
 megapixels and front quad core of 1.2 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.869
 ghz snapdragon 400 means a 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.399
 smartphone processor intermediary 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.930
 although windows phone has the issues 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.460
 for hardware is to take one always 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.220
 that blábláblá before starting the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.340
 videos of a boxing plus the same improvement is 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.979
 time for us to open this seal of piracy 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
 the microsoft moment boxes have been 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.680
 very simple indeed even when 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.939
 with the 2730 nokia logo I made 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.640
 a good being too simple too 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.390
 O the big one next door with bottom 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.009
 White 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.510
 I do not usually like to like 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.110
 white backgrounds but this one at least 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.540
 give me one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.440
 to if over microsoft is well 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.380
 cute 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.990
 Let's see what the air comes here and that 's it. 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.050
 Even my friends do not see usb cable. 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.390
 headphones just adapt from the direct 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.300
 have to use a usb cable that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.100
 There's already something down here. 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.930
 to put an end to the hopes is 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.060
 only a manual battery and the battery 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.510
 We're going to put a 3011 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.180
 peris maybe this gives something to 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.510
 they will not entail anything else the box is 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.780
 extremely basic is really cute 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.220
 but ordinary as of energy 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.350
 because only this 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.310
 so she on the phone that is what most 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.780
 is currently interested in the 5.7 screen as 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.510
 I said I'm well used now 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.000
 with these smartphones with large screens 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.290
 and for using the symphony 6 data I am 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.970
 holding upside down is a ips panel 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.209
 with hd resolution next to nothing here at 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.110
 turn the volume knob and force the club 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.820
 for earphone and USB input 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.670
 these back here we can take 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.670
 it out and see how you do 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:39.360
 coming out here and you put the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.799
 its five houses here as well as the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.310
 micro sd card that goes on these lots is the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.480
 output for sound is very small here imagine 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.400
 that it will not perform better 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.620
 than the number 730 when things do not 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.100
 in the 630 the sound performance by the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.900
 less in the boxes is quite basic a 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.510
 colloquium on the battery has a battery 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.510
 long of microsoft or microsoft 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:14.549
 here the detail for the flash and the name 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:17.729
 isa real ltda and this contrast with the 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.130
 price buttons is cool these funds I 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.390
 I found to sell like this in stores 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.300
 further out 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.370
 there were shops selling it to the white background 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.080
 black and other things too 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.000
 but there is a matter of importing 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.370
 maybe it's just for some 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.639
 then all black in front of the camera 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.800
 is at this point we will tighten the 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:45.479
 button to turn on this 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:49.220
 beauty was not thinking straight into this 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:52.500
 rodrigo by microsoft new disk 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:57.960
 and it means the screen is already 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.169
 being illuminated by the lcd panel itself 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.370
 ips so the black level is reasonable at 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.800
 sometimes the impression you have is 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.539
 without the videos is not the best possible is 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.250
 because it might look like 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.770
 more weight than is actually advocated 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.510
 setting there on the issue may be that 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.240
 looks gray but faced 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.680
 a lot of talk today we are here to help 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.150
 with just a few steps the phone 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.060
 ready for the settings 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.090
 begin by touching near 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.440
 error yes anyway that space initials 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:33.000
 that I'm going to accelerate not to 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:35.220
 to be so ugly the video is a galley 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.200
 this application configuration screen 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.960
 took two ice ages to finish 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.160
 that he saw until he gave a video safe but 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.010
 no problems 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.360
 tapping the button next one almost ready 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.490
 friend when you see he 's ready 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.000
 and I'll respond, thanks 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.590
 choose the fire the beauty of a bajaria 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.470
 brightness does not disturb the view 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.680
 here in the shoot and this is the home screen 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:02.310
 of windows phone is that many of us already 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.430
 are accustomed to the 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.080
 notifications bacaninha everything very beautiful 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.330
 Until then, it's beautiful, you're seeing bing. 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.639
 at least I put it on the bass without 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.720
 that automatic detection of students from the 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.970
 environment 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.229
 There is not much to talk about in this video. 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.010
 first impressions 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:24.030
 Let's just give a little piece of my money. 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.610
 camera number of settings at the top 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.410
 right there are the lumiere options 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.599
 focus probably has to go down in the 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.550
 shop that scheme of you focus on 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.000
 one thing is in front or behind the 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:40.169
 picture after you have done my self 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.620
 basic timer settings 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:55.139
 put the loaded wine to take a 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:58.259
 photo has been relatively quick 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.669
 time it takes to take a photo 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.340
 expectations about the cameras are 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:04.770
 really good and the look of the 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.759
 640 luminaries despite being extremely 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.069
 simple is well and is conservative does not have 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.210
 No smoke, I liked it. 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.360
 collection surprising me 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.849
 positively because it gives a boost in 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.770
 even though a black 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:21.120
 cool in the video too I'm staying for 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.889
 here I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.240
