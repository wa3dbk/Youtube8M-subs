prefer<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:46.580> my<00:01:46.670> hair<00:01:46.850> super<00:01:47.150> slicked<00:01:47.390> back

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
prefer like my hair super slicked back

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.390 
prefer like my hair super slicked back
so<00:01:48.470> I'm<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:48.650> pulling<00:01:48.890> out<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.070> sides<00:01:49.280> a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
so I'm just pulling out the sides a

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.280 
so I'm just pulling out the sides a
little<00:01:49.430> bit<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.240> if<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.540> like<00:01:50.870> your<00:01:51.050> style

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
little bit but if you like your style

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.340 
little bit but if you like your style
tighter<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:51.979> don't<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.249 

then<00:02:00.130> you're<00:02:00.400> going<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.610> grab<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.659> remaining

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
then you're going to grab the remaining

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.800 
then you're going to grab the remaining
hair<00:02:02.619> sticking<00:02:03.130> out<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.340> top<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.150> you're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
going to kind of fold it backwards to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.210 
going to kind of fold it backwards to
form<00:02:07.479> another<00:02:07.659> loop<00:02:08.110> you're<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:09.039> going<00:02:09.160> to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
form another loop you're just going to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.840 
form another loop you're just going to
tuck<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.610> underneath<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.420> elastic<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.440> top

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
tuck it underneath the elastic on top

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.040 
tuck it underneath the elastic on top
you're<00:02:12.850> going<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> loop<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.840> top

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
you're going to have like a loop on top

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.470 
you're going to have like a loop on top
and<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:14.380> I'll<00:02:14.500> loop<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.920> bottom<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and then I'll loop on the bottom and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.540 
and then I'll loop on the bottom and
then<00:02:16.900> any<00:02:17.200> little<00:02:17.530> strays<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.250> tuck<00:02:18.400> in

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
then any little strays you can tuck in

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.130 
then any little strays you can tuck in
as<00:02:18.670> well<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.270> if<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.420> have<00:02:19.510> layers<00:02:19.720> falling

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
as well but if you have layers falling
