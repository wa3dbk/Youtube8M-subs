I<00:00:07.250> kind<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.280> want<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.460> show<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.700> guys<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:08.880> a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I kind of want to show you guys how a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.930 
I kind of want to show you guys how a
differential<00:00:09.840> works<00:00:10.280> this<00:00:11.280> game<00:00:11.519> does<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.820> good

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
differential works this game does a good

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.020 
differential works this game does a good
job<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.210> explaining<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.400> basically<00:00:14.400> what

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
job of explaining it so basically what

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.599 
job of explaining it so basically what
it<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.080> diff<00:00:16.260> lock<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> explained

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it is is the diff lock how is explained

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.250 
it is is the diff lock how is explained
in<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> game<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.510> called<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> diff<00:00:19.020> lock

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
in the game is it's called the diff lock

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.859 
in the game is it's called the diff lock
it<00:00:19.470> stands<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.949> differential<00:00:20.430> unlock<00:00:20.970> or

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it stands for the differential unlock or

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.410 
it stands for the differential unlock or
sometimes<00:00:22.260> called<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> locker<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.430> what

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
sometimes called the locker and what

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.099 
sometimes called the locker and what
that<00:00:24.630> does<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.460> if<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.760> imagine<00:00:27.109> how

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
that does is if you can imagine how

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
that does is if you can imagine how
every<00:00:28.710> car<00:00:28.949> works<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:30.090> engine

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
every car works you have your engine

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749 
every car works you have your engine
which<00:00:31.410> feeds<00:00:31.679> power<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> transmission

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
which feeds power to the transmission

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
which feeds power to the transmission
and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> drive<00:00:33.840> shaft<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and then there's a drive shaft and the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760 
and then there's a drive shaft and the
drive<00:00:35.250> shaft<00:00:35.579> goes<00:00:35.820> into<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> axle<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> then

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
drive shaft goes into the axle and then

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
drive shaft goes into the axle and then
the<00:00:38.040> axles

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the axles

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
the axles
then<00:00:40.620> there's<00:00:40.829> gears<00:00:41.070> inside<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> axles<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
then there's gears inside the axles that

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.770 
then there's gears inside the axles that
make<00:00:42.780> both<00:00:43.260> tires<00:00:43.590> spin<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.660> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
make both tires spin and you can kind of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
make both tires spin and you can kind of
imagine<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.700> inside<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.910> axle<00:00:48.239> looks

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
imagine what inside of an axle looks

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
imagine what inside of an axle looks
like<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> drive<00:00:49.200> shaft<00:00:49.530> turns<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like the drive shaft turns into like a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.869 
like the drive shaft turns into like a
cone<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> gear<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
cone here so it's a gear like you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
cone here so it's a gear like you
imagine<00:00:54.300> any<00:00:54.420> other<00:00:54.480> type<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> gear<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.230> it's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
imagine any other type of gear but it's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.650 
imagine any other type of gear but it's
kind<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.590> shaped<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> triangle<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.850> then

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
kind of shaped like a triangle and then

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
kind of shaped like a triangle and then
you<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:58.829> triangles<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> come

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you have two other triangles that come

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.689 
you have two other triangles that come
from<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> tires<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.800> connect<00:01:02.219> into

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
from the tires that kind of connect into

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.420 
from the tires that kind of connect into
those<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.210> angles<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> tire<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.129> I'm

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
those two angles off the tire or I'm

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.740 
those two angles off the tire or I'm
sorry<00:01:05.700> off<00:01:05.880> off<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.290> axles<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.479> when<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
sorry off off the axles and when the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
sorry off off the axles and when the
drive<00:01:09.990> shaft<00:01:10.260> spins<00:01:10.650> from<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> engine

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
drive shaft spins from the engine

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.530 
drive shaft spins from the engine
accelerating<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:13.549> two<00:01:14.549> triangles<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.450> are

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
accelerating the two triangles that are

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.160 
accelerating the two triangles that are
connected<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> trip<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> tire<00:01:17.009> spin

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
connected to the trip to the tire spin

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
connected to the trip to the tire spin
because<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.439> they're<00:01:19.799> locked<00:01:20.070> into<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
because that's they're locked into that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.420 
because that's they're locked into that
gear<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.390> causes<00:01:21.630> both<00:01:22.259> tires<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.860> spin<00:01:23.159> on

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
gear and it causes both tires to spin on

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
gear and it causes both tires to spin on
that<00:01:23.700> axle

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that axle

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
that axle
so<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.490> an<00:01:26.640> off-road<00:01:27.000> vehicle<00:01:27.030> or

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so when you have an off-road vehicle or

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.610 
so when you have an off-road vehicle or
any<00:01:27.960> type<00:01:28.230> of<00:01:28.260> car<00:01:28.620> without<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.850> diff<00:01:30.330> lock<00:01:30.620> when

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
any type of car without a diff lock when

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.950 
any type of car without a diff lock when
the<00:01:34.130> when<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.160> drive<00:01:35.910> shaft<00:01:36.210> spins<00:01:36.600> both

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the when the drive shaft spins both

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740 
the when the drive shaft spins both
tires<00:01:37.230> spin<00:01:37.620> but<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.190> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.970> instance

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
tires spin but then if you get instance

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.410 
tires spin but then if you get instance
where<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.260> tire<00:01:40.500> gets<00:01:40.770> bound<00:01:41.010> up<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
where one tire gets bound up like on a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
where one tire gets bound up like on a
rock<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.410> there's<00:01:43.650> one<00:01:43.800> tire<00:01:44.040> that's

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
rock and then there's one tire that's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.540 
rock and then there's one tire that's
slightly<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.240> bound<00:01:45.479> up<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.650> one<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.430> is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
slightly not as bound up the one that is

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.340 
slightly not as bound up the one that is
not<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.880> bound<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
not as bound up is going to get all of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
not as bound up is going to get all of
that<00:01:49.530> energy<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> engine<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> it's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that energy from the engine and it's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.890 
that energy from the engine and it's
gonna<00:01:51.600> spin<00:01:51.990> freely<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> kind

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
gonna spin freely and so as you can kind

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.560 
gonna spin freely and so as you can kind
of<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.260> my<00:01:55.580> back<00:01:56.580> driver<00:01:56.970> tire<00:01:57.300> there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of see my back driver tire there

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.160 
of see my back driver tire there
spinning<00:01:58.140> freely<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.610> back

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
spinning freely and then my back

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
spinning freely and then my back
passenger<00:02:01.170> tire<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.910> kind<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
passenger tire is not and that's kind of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.910 
passenger tire is not and that's kind of
what<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.540> explaining<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.290> without<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
what I was explaining there without the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.030 
what I was explaining there without the
locker<00:02:05.160> or<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.940> diff<00:02:06.119> lock<00:02:06.410> all<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.680> energy

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
locker or the diff lock all that energy

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.470 
locker or the diff lock all that energy
goes<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.910> back<00:02:09.570> driver's<00:02:10.170> side<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
goes to the back driver's side so with a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.970 
goes to the back driver's side so with a
lock<00:02:13.130> with<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.370> locker<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:15.170> what<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.380> does<00:02:16.620> is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
lock with a locker on what that does is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.290 
lock with a locker on what that does is
it<00:02:17.430> forces<00:02:18.260> both<00:02:19.260> tires<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:20.310> spin<00:02:20.730> at<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:20.970> same

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
it forces both tires to spin at the same

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.160 
it forces both tires to spin at the same
time<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.430> whenever<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.420> turned<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> diff<00:02:25.050> lock

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
time so whenever I turned the diff lock

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.330 
time so whenever I turned the diff lock
on<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.700> game<00:02:27.140> it'll<00:02:28.140> cause<00:02:28.380> both<00:02:28.709> tires<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
on in the game it'll cause both tires to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.000 
on in the game it'll cause both tires to
spin<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.209> if<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:30.720> don't<00:02:30.870> spin<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:31.799> that's

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
spin and if they don't spin then that's

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470 
spin and if they don't spin then that's
usually<00:02:32.340> how<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.489> get<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> broken<00:02:32.940> axle

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
usually how you get a broken axle

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.930 
usually how you get a broken axle
because<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.380> diff<00:02:34.530> lock<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.980> forcing<00:02:35.580> both

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
because the diff lock is forcing both

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.509 
because the diff lock is forcing both
tires<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.450> spin<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:37.920> bound<00:02:38.160> up<00:02:38.340> it

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
tires to spin and if it's so bound up it

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.100 
tires to spin and if it's so bound up it
doesn't<00:02:38.790> work<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.299> just<00:02:39.630> turn<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> diff

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
doesn't work so I just turn the diff

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.500 
doesn't work so I just turn the diff
lock<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.040> we'll<00:02:41.760> take<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> look<00:02:42.209> at<00:02:42.330> what<00:02:42.420> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
lock on and we'll take a look at what it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.539 
lock on and we'll take a look at what it
does<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.200> see<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.590> both<00:02:43.769> tires<00:02:44.280> are

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
does and you can see that both tires are

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.270 
does and you can see that both tires are
spinning<00:02:44.760> now<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.959> Jeep<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.320> trying<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
spinning now and the Jeep is trying to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
spinning now and the Jeep is trying to
get<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> little<00:02:47.670> more<00:02:47.880> traction<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:48.600> it's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
get a little more traction but it's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
get a little more traction but it's
caught<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.860> front<00:02:50.130> end<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> front

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
caught up on the front end the front

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.110 
caught up on the front end the front
bumper<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.440> see<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.860> point<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:53.610> example

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
bumper but you see the point my example

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.229 
bumper but you see the point my example
here<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.570> with<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> off<00:02:55.709> my<00:02:56.640> driver's<00:02:57.060> side

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
here is with it off my driver's side

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.850 
here is with it off my driver's side
tire<00:02:57.450> spinning<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.350> see<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.769> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
tire spinning and you can see on the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.890 
tire spinning and you can see on the
front<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.700> front<00:02:59.850> drivers<00:03:00.330> spinning<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.750> well

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
front the front drivers spinning as well

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
front the front drivers spinning as well
it<00:03:01.860> was<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.250> they<00:03:02.519> both<00:03:02.700> spin

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
it was on they both spin

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.380 
it was on they both spin
and<00:03:04.190> that's<00:03:04.490> basically<00:03:04.880> what's<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.240> whoa

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
and that's basically what's at whoa

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.720 
and that's basically what's at whoa
that's<00:03:06.230> basically<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.190> was<00:03:07.460> a<00:03:07.490> game

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
that's basically and that was a game

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.170 
that's basically and that was a game
glitch<00:03:08.030> that's<00:03:08.300> not<00:03:08.569> real<00:03:08.810> life<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.940> that's

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
glitch that's not real life but that's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.709 
glitch that's not real life but that's
basically<00:03:11.390> what<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> diff<00:03:12.110> lock<00:03:12.230> er<00:03:12.380> does
