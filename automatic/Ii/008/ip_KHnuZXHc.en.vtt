we're<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.700> use<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> special<00:02:00.840> technique

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
we're going to use a special technique

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.499 
we're going to use a special technique
to<00:02:01.229> prepare<00:02:01.680> drumstick<00:02:02.310> grill<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> then

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to prepare drumstick grill them and then

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.679 
to prepare drumstick grill them and then
turn<00:02:03.750> them<00:02:03.960> into<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.729> buffalo<00:02:05.729> style<00:02:05.969> wing<00:02:06.329> with

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
it all to that plastic bag now I chose

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
it all to that plastic bag now I chose
to<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.950> boning<00:02:24.550> technique<00:02:24.970> called

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
to do a boning technique called

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.050 
to do a boning technique called
frenching<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.140> my<00:02:26.410> drumsticks<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.580> did<00:02:27.940> this

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
frenching of my drumsticks I did this

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.210 
frenching of my drumsticks I did this
for<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.270> few<00:02:28.480> reasons<00:02:28.660> first<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.740> think<00:02:29.950> it's<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
for a few reasons first I think it's a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.340 
for a few reasons first I think it's a
little<00:02:30.340> bit<00:02:30.520> more<00:02:30.700> elegant<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.330> serve<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
little bit more elegant to serve it's a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.530 
little bit more elegant to serve it's a
little<00:02:32.590> easier<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.310> less<00:02:33.490> messy<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.120> handle

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
little easier and less messy to handle

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.110 
little easier and less messy to handle
and<00:02:34.750> when<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.650> move<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.160> meat<00:02:36.460> down<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
and when you move the meat down on the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
and when you move the meat down on the
bone<00:02:37.300> which<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:37.960> show<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.770> actually

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
bone which I will show you it actually

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.950 
bone which I will show you it actually
concentrates<00:02:39.880> all<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.240> meat<00:02:40.390> together<00:02:40.570> and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
concentrates all the meat together and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.660 
concentrates all the meat together and
makes<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.260> cook<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.650> little<00:02:41.680> bit<00:02:41.950> more<00:02:42.220> evenly

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
makes it cook a little bit more evenly

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.580 
makes it cook a little bit more evenly
so<00:02:43.180> let<00:02:43.330> me<00:02:43.390> show<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.630> how<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.810> French<00:02:44.380> a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
so let me show you how to French a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.710 
so let me show you how to French a
drumstick<00:02:45.160> first<00:02:45.730> peel<00:02:46.060> off<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.390> skin<00:02:46.570> of

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
drumstick first peel off the skin of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.590 
drumstick first peel off the skin of
your<00:02:46.870> drumstick<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.340> base<00:02:48.580> cut<00:02:49.030> all<00:02:49.240> the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
your drumstick at the base cut all the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600 
your drumstick at the base cut all the
way<00:02:49.690> around<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.140> bone<00:02:50.320> then<00:02:51.040> use<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.370> knife

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
way around the bone then use your knife

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.090 
way around the bone then use your knife
to<00:02:51.790> scrape<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.720> leg<00:02:52.990> meat<00:02:53.290> off<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.860> end<00:02:54.010> of

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
to scrape the leg meat off the end of

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.430 
to scrape the leg meat off the end of
the<00:02:54.190> bone<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.910> then<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.270> clean<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.840> most<00:02:56.080> meat

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
the bone so then it's clean of most meat

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.280 
the bone so then it's clean of most meat
you'll<00:02:57.010> push<00:02:57.310> all<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.820> extra<00:02:58.240> meat<00:02:58.360> down<00:02:58.780> into

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
you'll push all the extra meat down into

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710 
you'll push all the extra meat down into
the<00:02:59.410> center<00:02:59.770> trim<00:03:00.370> off<00:03:00.520> any<00:03:00.790> loose<00:03:01.000> cartilage

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
the center trim off any loose cartilage

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.380 
the center trim off any loose cartilage
now<00:03:02.320> rotate<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:03.130> bone<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.550> lies<00:03:03.730> closest

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
now rotate the bone so it lies closest

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.600 
now rotate the bone so it lies closest
to<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.690> cutting<00:03:04.960> board<00:03:04.990> place<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.100> midpoint

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
to the cutting board place the midpoint

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.610 
to the cutting board place the midpoint
of<00:03:06.760> your<00:03:06.970> chef's<00:03:07.270> knife<00:03:07.420> close<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.320> end<00:03:08.470> of
