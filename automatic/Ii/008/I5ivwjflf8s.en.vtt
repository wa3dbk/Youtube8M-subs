 water temperature is only 15 degrees 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.450
 mountain lake is another obstacle on the way 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.550
 scouts behind were cool 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.150
 air crossings and underground lifts 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.590
 transitions 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
 the scouts crossed the tunnel 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.849
 23 meters full 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.880
 uniforms this obstacle course 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.189
 the military passed 40 minutes roughly speaking 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.689
 we have been doing a month to improve 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.680
 this trail 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.859
 made 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.349
 and two days and show this result it 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 already, in principle, washed small but 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 achievement mountain training necessarily 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 for every scout before class 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.790
 instructing many military for the first time 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 have to work with mountaineering 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 airborne equipment part 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.969
 combat training on the opposite 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.120
 scout awaits unpleasant 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.170
 surprise 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 occupies a circular defense city 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 covers directly crossing and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.820
 military men one by one all worlds fucking 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 and performed in mud conditions with 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 adversary so we are always ready 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.270
 repel an attack on a surprise attack 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 enemy scouts must respond 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 lightning fast in any situation therefore 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.869
 every test is a combat test 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.150
 skills to start the military pass 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.430
 easy routes fighters need to overcome 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.100
 fear speak instructors and only after 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.290

 meters ups and downs work on 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 several hours a day as soon as

 since the beginning of this year at the site 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.329

 fighters from several regions at once 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.119
 combat coordination of units she 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.189
 very important for servicemen to discharge 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.649
 units because every second 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.170
