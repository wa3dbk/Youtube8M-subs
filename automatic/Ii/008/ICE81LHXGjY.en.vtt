 hunter 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.040
 in the modern world commercials 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.610
 shields and booklets have become a familiar part 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 life but from the TV spot is easy 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.009
 you can get rid of switching channel booklet 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.919
 throwing on a billboard just not 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.800
 pay attention but if the adware 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.529
 the message is hanging right across the road not 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 notice it especially drivers just 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.850
 impossible to order the manufacture of such 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.129
 hauling comes from the sales department 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.930
 it is made electronically in order 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.420
 marked sizes and colors 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 Specified number of copies and terms 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 manufacturing 1 who receives 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 electronic order 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.039
 designer he makes a virtual layout 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.339
 The constrictions checks the colors in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 electronic thumbnail file received 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.670
 if it finds a discrepancy corrects 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.429
 tones 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.269
 creating a layout, the designer takes into account that 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.990
 print time 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.340
 hauling warms up to 200 degrees 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.070
 therefore the tissues that are applied 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.470
 the image will shrink out 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.060
 constructs a mock obviously larger 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.610
 size 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.799
 then the virtual layout sends to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.750
 photo sample 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.210
 print it on the same fabric from which 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 will do the constriction itself only 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.710
 50 times smaller 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.780
 Sample shows to customer if its 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.300
 everything suits the customer puts his 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.710
 signature on the photo sample now this 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.820
 document permits to print the whole edition 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.390
 approved layout by email 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.150
 dumped into the dense doctor same 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.830
 the printer is only much bigger it 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.430
 prints the image on paper 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.720
 and mirroring is easier 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.220
 will bring a picture and text on the cloth 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.910
 for printing uses water 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.950
 dispersion paint in 6 colors 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.590
 paper size corresponds to natural 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.710
 Hauling there are three 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.840
 standard lengths 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.910
 1013 or 15 meters 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.900
 finished paper mopping 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.629
 enters the shop 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 calender of thermo presses which 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.750
 the image is transferred to the fabric 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.600
 now it comes calender come out 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.850
 madris is a machine with mechanical 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.330
 drives it uses special 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.330
 butter 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.490
 sustained high temperatures which 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.990
 required to transfer the image to 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.850
 cloth and so felt conveyor belt 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.090
 presses the paper to matter 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.930
 due to high temperature 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.060
 the paint from the paper goes over the cloth 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 the process lasts half an hour during this time 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.140
 only one side is made 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.200
 banners second 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.280
 on it most often another advertisement does 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.360
 similar technology billet with 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.310
 sends the finished image to the tailoring 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.500
 the front side of the waist roll out on 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.420
 long table 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.510
 top put a gasket of polymer 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.570
 fabrics it is necessary that matter is not 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.490
 shine through in bright sunshine 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.930
 otherwise, the two advertising sides will merge into 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.980
 full of gibberish 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.000
 and no one will not understand anything except 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.740
 polymer fabric allows the whole 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.490
 constructions to withstand gusts 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.490
 hurricane wind 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.830
 then spread the second part of the waist 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.550
 their excess fabric 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.490
 trim my tailor my scissors all three 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.120
 layer with padding fasten between 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.990
 by myself 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.040
 pins the fabric folds and ships 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.200
 patch 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.159
 hauling sheathed on 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.709
 perimeter from four sides ready 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.129
 advertising banners neatly fold 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.209
 in such a compact form I give them in 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.209
 assembly crews
