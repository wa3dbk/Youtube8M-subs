 hello to all so today I'm going 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.830
 present you a recipe around 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.930
 hired at ellis so here is a 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.160
 local product whose knight and 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.600
 work on the theme a little bit of 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.400
 serve it with lemongrass and 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.660
 curry very well and with so you go 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.760
 the company of a small network that the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.620
 car seat with instead of parmesan 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.059
 cantal to honor the region 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.059
 where the water at work is gone 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.680
 stéphane we start with what then 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.760
 parisotto the president will start with 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.860
 the cars we are going to make a risotto 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.479
 traditional ones because we will start 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.850
 by six and then shallots to the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.220
 peel ok so here we will put some 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.020
 shallots that we will do so to come 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.940
 just got is just had they did 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.990
 especially no Japanese coloring goes that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.759
 is going to be the mother we are going to wear from 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.320
 the bitterness to know free kittens was going 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.240
 leave in the risotto 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.560
 so it must be well 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.060
 translucent we are very far 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.830
 it was very very finely chiseled six 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 very very hungry students so here at 6 the 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.820
 cds little dice after we will do 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.410
 what are we going to pearl laurie here we go 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.570
 would miss so we'll start nicely 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.220
 so you can turn on the induction 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.300
 so I work I work 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.280
 mainly based on olive oil 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.330
 a background of olive oil go this is 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.009
 left to think I do things 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.179
 so here we're just going to just sweat 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.470
 shallot 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.970
 then we go to the creamery so here we go 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.270
 well kept volumes because the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.350
 risotto volume 3 faults volume on 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.990
 will put the first volume 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.490
 once the pearly rice when the water 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.869
 has evaporated that there is no more water 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.250
 puts the second volume always agree 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.440
 until absorption exactly here 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.660
 up to function and the last volume 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.459
 so a little technique be with the juice 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.060
 fish that we will do after the juice 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.040
 of shells 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.500
 wahhab gave a little bit our tests 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.970
 and suddenly I can see the shallots 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.600
 we start to collapse dead and so 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.600
 I saw the elevation onu la up there 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.910
 after nothing prevents m small 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.340
 sprigs of thyme yes here is a small 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.590
 bay leaf of equaterra the end 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.790
 Here withdraw that and he brings 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.110
 little bit of mud then there is also a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.090
 little small combines is put a 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.260
 little food garlic 1 let me guess 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.430
 if you do not want fluff and you want 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.110
 just sandstone such a fear like that 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.860
 you have it without shirts with themes 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.410
 hockey ap the bank the device on 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.570
 will remove after after I am autonomous 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.070
 tell them to know that in the end 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.480
 then you have 18 minutes that's about it 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.590
 this is the rule that's the money 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.590
 neither will go 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.940
 so here is always height height there 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.600
 so we'll go down a little bit 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.430
 now it has to be there 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.170
 slowly 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.940
 then stéphane there it is good to raise 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.480
 the nets here we have kept well the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.970
 stopped 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.260
 good for sure that at home it's a 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.100
 little bit of technique lift the nets 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.600
 remove the ridges 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.280
 but we can do is ask 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.410
 his fishmonger to kindly do it 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.570
 or so general he does not refuse it's a 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.440
 pleasure for them and then like that 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.440
 wants lives all these little hassles 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.360
 here is put our cocks back the hall and we 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.360
 do not put all the names 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:47.750
 otherwise if we have too much it is on average 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.750
 the aperitif is now we hear well 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.790
 and here we will deglaze with white wine 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.390
 were going perfect full like home 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.940
 mussels 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.950
 the mullahs did honor to their 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.640
 marinière his cutlery there the hulls 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.870
 are cooked 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.330
 so we'll go we'll help him when 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.710
 you're ok so help him when you try 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.840
 remove them 100 orders their juice 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.280
 exactly how far I want 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.350
 it's a problem I had a little bit 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.690
 nitrates like that one with the title 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.160
 she the room is while leopold I 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.510
 see that to know that comedians those 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.100
 who suffer past who are not good of 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.330
 crate and without fake steps forced have not 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.000
 strong is that his parents I'm going 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.860
 start there who are from the nail to know 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.100
 it's very delicate, it's very, very 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.530
 quick 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.270
 it's going to be a poaching cooking so this 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.010
 what to say there we will cook under cover 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.680
 this is covered so you stop the water from 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.420
 vegetation are you shallots and 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.400
 fish we will clear a little noilly prat 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.770
 to bring a little acidity ours 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.560
 can that be true to resist 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:49.430
 so that's how we go everything and ice 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:54.560
 wall noilly prat you can no longer that's nothing 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.120
 So you have given a little bit of 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.560
 here we go I put everything 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.210
 water was, but we realized with 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.550
 the codes here is a little bit of water 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.070
 So exactly where covered vocation 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.720
 y is ok it must be scary 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.490
 that's perfect all this can be lowered 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.780
 a little bit and that's right they 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.040
 are seen with their brilliance beats it's going 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.870
 that set steam in his own 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.700
 steam have dezired important so we 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.750
 take some taste we will finish our risotto 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.450
 so as we said we're going to drag him 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.310
 with the small cantal loire and the end and 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.660
 have still finished we know the 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.520
 small sequanne corner shells 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.350
 in quebec the fish and the fruits the 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.750
 sauce has shrunk these perfect so 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:32.360
 laure lightly cream market during 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:35.420
 a little bit like that I was preparing a 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.710
 little salad shiso mix then lashes or 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.180
 mixed it's true that it's a product 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.760
 we can not necessarily find everywhere 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.080
 south quay board for the bottom for 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.370
 replace to answer or so for the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.890
 replace buy chervil 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.150
 I've bought dill in 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.460
 chives and makes you a little mixture 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.830
 herb that is if he will bring 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.170
 freshness to your plan so now I m 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.570
 a little very small round really a 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.440
 just a little bit to bring some pep 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.440
 little bit of salt flower of guerande 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.130
 she has a little bit of olive oil 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.110
 a little advice for is missioned to 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.830
 to make a lot of foam me a little 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.660
 little tried 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.030
 ap on puts a small knob of butter 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.210
 or so we go there I miss a need 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.210
 homes 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.560
 so that's just a pure body and 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.050
 look at the preparation to have this 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.180
 scum here exactly 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.600
 so here we start with the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.190
 risotto 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.840
 so here I think we were a little 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.729
 little packed we did a lot a month 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.120
 but we are more or less we are 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:34.040
 great 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:37.729
 So here we go after 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.889
 coaches the hulls so there's no 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.120
 need it to be too hot unfair 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.620
 with the heat of lesotho and fish 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.080
 like there's no problem, it's okay 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.080
 heat in fact difference so there we 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.490
 are you going to take a white maintenance of 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.810
 questionnaires it's cooked functions that 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.880
 we are we discover the regulation 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:58.130
 google came out that saec then after 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:02.840
 our little frothy foamy sauce 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:04.639
 so here we go we put it around 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.229
 we do not have the fox the char hat 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.280
 knight no no no not if we can 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.990
 give a little but what it takes 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.050
 we are all chickens 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.449
 the tastes we discover agree 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.410
 we're trying to make volume 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.690
 not always let work in 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.410
