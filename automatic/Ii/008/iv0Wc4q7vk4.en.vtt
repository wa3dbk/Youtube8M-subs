extension hair and that just ended up

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.000 
extension hair and that just ended up
looking<00:00:38.489> real<00:00:38.790> crazy<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.899> decided<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> just

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
looking real crazy so I decided to just

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
looking real crazy so I decided to just
twist<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.520> again<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
twist it up again but I was not about to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
twist it up again but I was not about to
sit<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> twist<00:00:43.920> every<00:00:44.489> single<00:00:45.149> twist

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sit there and twist every single twist

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
sit there and twist every single twist
again<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.800> came<00:00:47.219> up<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.890> method<00:00:49.890> here

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
again so I came up with this method here

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.350 
again so I came up with this method here
