to<00:02:31.780> think<00:02:31.989> pod<00:02:32.260> was<00:02:32.470> really<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> big<00:02:32.950> map<00:02:33.159> but

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to think pod was really a big map but

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.500 
to think pod was really a big map but

like the pic 10 sets the pick 10 system
I<00:02:54.760> think<00:02:54.790> it'll<00:02:55.030> look<00:02:55.120> pretty<00:02:55.239> cool<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.750> think

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.599 
I think it'll look pretty cool I think
it's<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.349> pretty<00:02:56.500> good<00:02:56.709> idea<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:57.220> know<00:02:57.310> i'm<00:02:57.459> not

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
it's a pretty good idea you know i'm not

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.280 
it's a pretty good idea you know i'm not
saying<00:02:57.909> i<00:02:58.030> came<00:02:58.269> up<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.629> on<00:02:58.780> my<00:02:58.810> own<00:02:58.900> i

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
saying i came up with this on my own i

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.500 
saying i came up with this on my own i
came<00:02:59.680> up<00:02:59.769> with<00:02:59.859> the<00:02:59.950> idea<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.400> my<00:03:00.670> own<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:01.329> took

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
came up with the idea on my own it took

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.670 
came up with the idea on my own it took
a<00:03:01.569> little<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.930> brainstorming<00:03:02.409> with<00:03:02.530> my

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
a little bit of brainstorming with my

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.559 
a little bit of brainstorming with my
dad<00:03:02.859> but<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.099> leave<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.489> i<00:03:03.519> believe<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
dad but I leave it is i believe the

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.869 
dad but I leave it is i believe the
series<00:03:04.900> idea<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.409> or<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.980> series<00:03:06.220> name<00:03:06.519> is

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
series idea is or the series name is

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.270 
series idea is or the series name is
