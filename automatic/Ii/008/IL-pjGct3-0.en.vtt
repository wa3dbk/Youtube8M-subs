00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
and GT and stuff so focused a lot on

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170 
and GT and stuff so focused a lot on
creating<00:03:22.590> tracks<00:03:22.830> over<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> week<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.700> look<00:03:24.090> at

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
creating tracks over the week I look at

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
creating tracks over the week I look at
this<00:03:24.270> man<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:25.590> turn<00:03:25.770> of<00:03:25.860> events<00:03:26.190> right

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
this man so that's turn of events right

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.729 
this man so that's turn of events right
there<00:03:26.550> was<00:03:26.670> unfortunate<00:03:27.440> basically<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> lot<00:03:28.650> of

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
there was unfortunate basically a lot of

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.440 
there was unfortunate basically a lot of
people<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.250> don't<00:03:29.760> know<00:03:29.880> what<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.209> what

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.030 
people I don't know what it is what
people<00:03:30.480> but<00:03:30.959> they<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:31.230> love<00:03:31.440> fashion<00:03:31.860> into

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
people but they just love fashion into

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.590 
people but they just love fashion into
lampposts<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.940> know<00:03:33.030> they<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.209> no<00:03:33.330> regard

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
lampposts you know they have no regard

lampposts you know they have no regard
for<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.989> what<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> understand<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.100> slows<00:03:35.370> down

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
for it what I understand is a slows down

for it what I understand is a slows down
your<00:03:35.700> car<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> little<00:03:36.000> bit<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.540> also<00:03:36.630> affects

your car a little bit and also affects

situation<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:43.050> was<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.890> front<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.160> guy<00:03:44.370> I

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
situation I was in front of that guy I

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.130 
situation I was in front of that guy I
try<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:44.940> avoid<00:03:45.150> him<00:03:45.300> which<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.540> did<00:03:45.600> perfectly

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
try to avoid him which I did perfectly

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.110 
try to avoid him which I did perfectly
we<00:03:46.830> avoided<00:03:47.310> each<00:03:47.430> other<00:03:47.610> for<00:03:47.850> she<00:03:48.000> that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
we avoided each other for she that

we avoided each other for she that
person<00:03:48.480> takes<00:03:48.630> our<00:03:48.810> lampposts<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.320> I

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
person takes our lampposts and I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.580 
person takes our lampposts and I
completely<00:03:49.950> flip<00:03:50.310> over<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.640> lamppost<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
completely flip over the lamppost and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.010 
completely flip over the lamppost and
yeah<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.830> is<00:03:52.980> what<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.750> I'd<00:03:54.750> only<00:03:54.810> use

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
yeah it is what it is but I'd only use

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.470 
yeah it is what it is but I'd only use
an<00:03:55.200> off<00:03:55.290> break<00:03:55.530> there<00:03:55.770> on<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.070> ramp<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.880> good

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
an off break there on the ramp so good

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.150 
an off break there on the ramp so good
angle<00:03:57.930> pretty<00:03:58.200> messed<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.830> ones<00:03:58.980> I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
angle pretty messed up and the ones I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.250 
angle pretty messed up and the ones I
accelerated<00:03:59.790> completely<00:04:00.630> spun<00:04:00.840> out<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.020> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
accelerated completely spun out with the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.750 
accelerated completely spun out with the
car<00:04:01.470> that's<00:04:02.190> my<00:04:02.370> bad

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
car that's my bad

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
car that's my bad
you<00:04:02.820> know<00:04:02.910> even<00:04:03.090> though<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.239> car<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.600> bit

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
you know even though the car is a bit

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.110 
you know even though the car is a bit
erect<00:04:04.320> but<00:04:04.440> that's<00:04:04.590> no<00:04:04.680> excuse<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.910> part

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
erect but that's no excuse so this part

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
erect but that's no excuse so this part
of<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.209> track<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.570> interesting<00:04:07.230> because<00:04:07.320> you

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
of the track is interesting because you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.710 
of the track is interesting because you
know<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.400> could<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.209> be<00:04:09.390> put<00:04:09.570> into

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
know all of this could not be put into

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.050 
know all of this could not be put into
place<00:04:10.019> if<00:04:10.320> known<00:04:10.830> onto<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> non-contact<00:04:11.880> was

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
place if known onto a non-contact was

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.360 
place if known onto a non-contact was
not<00:04:12.209> coming<00:04:12.390> out<00:04:12.480> simply<00:04:13.290> because<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.250> know

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
not coming out simply because you know

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.000 
not coming out simply because you know
all<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.330> these<00:04:15.540> narrow<00:04:15.870> little<00:04:16.200> bits<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.680> bobs

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
all of these narrow little bits and bobs

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.250 
all of these narrow little bits and bobs
really<00:04:17.820> wouldn't<00:04:18.060> make<00:04:18.150> sense<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.750> contact

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
really wouldn't make sense with contact

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.080 
really wouldn't make sense with contact
racing<00:04:19.590> right<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.280> really<00:04:20.880> wouldn't<00:04:21.000> have

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
racing right so I really wouldn't have

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.730 
racing right so I really wouldn't have
been<00:04:21.239> able<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.450> push<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.080> extent<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.620> I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
been able to push to the extent that I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.760 
been able to push to the extent that I
did<00:04:23.010> with<00:04:23.669> these<00:04:23.880> tracks<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.590> inside

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
did with these tracks so this is inside

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.500 
did with these tracks so this is inside
the<00:04:26.100> horse<00:04:26.310> track<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:26.970> suppose

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
the horse track I suppose

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.540 
the horse track I suppose
within<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.140> I'm<00:04:28.710> just<00:04:29.010> going<00:04:29.220> around<00:04:29.340> a

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
within that I'm just going around a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.000 
within that I'm just going around a
circular<00:04:29.760> motions<00:04:30.210> around<00:04:31.080> upon<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.680> suppose

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
circular motions around upon the suppose

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.950 
circular motions around upon the suppose
but<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.880> all-powerful<00:04:33.240> joining<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.780> car

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
but this all-powerful joining the car

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.600 
but this all-powerful joining the car
yet<00:04:34.140> again<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.620> this<00:04:34.950> particular<00:04:35.220> section

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
yet again and this particular section

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.860 
yet again and this particular section
would<00:04:35.820> going<00:04:35.940> back<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.240> forth<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:36.630> this

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
would going back and forth so this

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.360 
would going back and forth so this
another<00:04:37.170> area<00:04:37.620> where<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.980> collide<00:04:38.220> with

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
another area where you can collide with

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.190 
another area where you can collide with
another<00:04:38.400> car<00:04:38.820> coming<00:04:39.030> through<00:04:39.330> but<00:04:39.990> yet<00:04:40.110> again

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
another car coming through but yet again

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.080 
another car coming through but yet again
makes<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.590> interesting<00:04:40.920> but<00:04:41.370> not<00:04:41.430> intended

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
makes it interesting but not intended

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.420 
makes it interesting but not intended
for<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:42.450> situation<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.260> occur<00:04:43.430> especially

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
for that situation to occur especially

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.180 
for that situation to occur especially
as<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.610> said<00:04:44.820> many<00:04:45.420> many<00:04:45.480> times<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.860> reasons

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
as I said many many times the reasons

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.710 
as I said many many times the reasons
why<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.340> create<00:04:47.610> these<00:04:47.730> tracks<00:04:48.060> but<00:04:48.420> anyway

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
why I create these tracks but anyway
