00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.540
 November 6, 2013 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.240
 tonight tonight in conjunction with 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
 a tide of high coefficient 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 we have good series that leaves 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 a lot of water because we have 12 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.060
 antipas meters not exceptional but he 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.039
 there are good pictures anyway coach 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 parked near to keep that one or a lot of the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.070
 everything and up to the level that it takes a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.220
 it leaves a lot of water when 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220
 even 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.530
 she is beautiful this 40 behind the very 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.530
 beautiful her real this one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:53.490
 yes it goes back to the batteries in sanaa 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.490
 was a pretty good impact there 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.130
 it puts a lot of others we will say 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.590
 we realize 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.590
 thickness 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.829
 a series very well the impact has when 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.890
 even since it's really 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.890
 until the end 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.220
 this one can be that she will put in 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.220
 a little bit but not bad 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.549
 cd we can see very well the length of the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.049
 swell we really have big 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.200
 of calm then it comes back from a single 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.200
 stroke 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.800
 a little one there that must be given a 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.800
 little bit of attention 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.370
 we really have a very, very good impact 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.370
 just now filming it at the right time 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.650
 so there we are at the full to the aces and 20h54 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.700
 we have 12 meters not theoretical with a 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.700
 slight boost this one is not bad 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.320
 we have already seen well stone here a beautiful 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.000
 blow recognizes your power of this 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.780
 sector 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.780
