00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.030 

well<00:00:02.429> I<00:00:02.460> just<00:00:02.580> thought<00:00:02.939> I'd<00:00:03.380> show<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
well I just thought I'd show you the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.600 
well I just thought I'd show you the
actual<00:00:06.020> motor<00:00:07.020> running<00:00:07.589> I've<00:00:07.950> put<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.490> back

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
actual motor running I've put it back

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.540 
actual motor running I've put it back
together<00:00:08.760> laws<00:00:09.360> one<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> coils<00:00:10.490> taking<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
together laws one and the coils taking a

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.980 
together laws one and the coils taking a
break<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:13.400> there<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.360> thing<00:00:15.570> running

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
break and there is the thing running

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.450 
break and there is the thing running
it's<00:00:16.230> running<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:16.890> different<00:00:17.279> than<00:00:17.430> it

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
it's running a little different than it

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.650 
it's running a little different than it
was<00:00:17.930> before<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.439> took<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.770> apart<00:00:20.420> run<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> little

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
was before it took it apart run a little

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.929 
was before it took it apart run a little
faster<00:00:21.779> now<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.410> actually<00:00:23.369> putting<00:00:23.760> out

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
faster now and actually putting out

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.349 
faster now and actually putting out
quite<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> bit<00:00:24.420> more<00:00:24.720> juice<00:00:26.359> that's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
quite a bit more juice that's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.710 
quite a bit more juice that's
interesting<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.890> know<00:00:29.010> there<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
interesting but you know there is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.470 
interesting but you know there is
running<00:00:31.969> you<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:34.399> obviously<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.640> coil<00:00:35.910> here

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
running you know obviously the coil here

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.560 
running you know obviously the coil here
is<00:00:36.950> quite<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> bit<00:00:38.100> different<00:00:38.250> than<00:00:39.950> when<00:00:40.950> I'm

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
is quite a bit different than when I'm

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
is quite a bit different than when I'm
just<00:00:42.570> wow<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:44.329> just<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
just wow which just this one put it in

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.680 
just wow which just this one put it in
here<00:00:47.520> without<00:00:49.430> dropping<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.360> know

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
here without dropping it in so you know

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.209 
here without dropping it in so you know
this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.559> wound<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> I'm

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this is the one I just wound and I'm

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.439 
this is the one I just wound and I'm
playing<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:57.469> nevertheless<00:00:59.449> there

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
playing with it but nevertheless there

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
playing with it but nevertheless there
it<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.690> running<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> thing<00:01:02.489> spin

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it is running I can make the thing spin

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
it is running I can make the thing spin
extremely<00:01:03.539> fast<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.199> didn't<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
extremely fast I didn't have all the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
extremely fast I didn't have all the
resistance<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> stuff<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.960> there<00:01:09.960> it's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
resistance of it and stuff so there it's

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
resistance of it and stuff so there it's
charging<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.180> doing<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
charging and right now I'm doing a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.580 
charging and right now I'm doing a
charging<00:01:13.530> mode<00:01:14.509> using<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.540> basic<00:01:16.020> Benini

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
charging mode using the basic Benini

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.510 
charging mode using the basic Benini
circuit<00:01:17.720> except<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.890> using<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
circuit except that I'm using the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.010 
circuit except that I'm using the
Darlington<00:01:22.400> arrangement<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
Darlington arrangement on the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.070 
Darlington arrangement on the
transistors<00:01:25.610> otherwise<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.330> standard

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
transistors otherwise just standard

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.580 
transistors otherwise just standard
stuff<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:30.049> pan<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.590> show<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:33.590> right

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
stuff we pan up and show you that right

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
stuff we pan up and show you that right
now<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.009> running<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.939> PCE<00:01:36.659> power

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
now I'm running off of a PCE power

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.600 
now I'm running off of a PCE power
supply<00:01:38.060> because<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:40.159> discharged<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.310> my<00:01:41.430> other

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
supply because i discharged all my other

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
supply because i discharged all my other
batteries<00:01:42.860> playing<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:45.439> actually

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
batteries playing with actually

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.539 
batteries playing with actually
recovering<00:01:47.360> old<00:01:48.360> batteries<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.110> i<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:50.250> i

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
recovering old batteries which i think i

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
recovering old batteries which i think i
have<00:01:51.259> almost<00:01:52.259> completely<00:01:52.979> done<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:55.170> one

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
have almost completely done on this one

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.850 
have almost completely done on this one
here<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.820> i've<00:01:57.270> got<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:57.810> almost<00:01:58.469> 12

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
here and i've got it about almost 12

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.020 
here and i've got it about almost 12
volts

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.070 

four<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.720> five<00:02:02.750> volts<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:05.540> battery<00:02:05.900> backup

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
four or five volts the battery backup

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.919 
four or five volts the battery backup
said<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.710> wasn't<00:02:06.860> chargeable<00:02:07.400> anymore<00:02:07.929> I'm

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
said it wasn't chargeable anymore I'm

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.570 
said it wasn't chargeable anymore I'm
not<00:02:09.110> sure<00:02:09.319> about<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.649> other<00:02:09.770> three<00:02:10.100> they

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
not sure about the other three they

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.210 
not sure about the other three they
might<00:02:11.420> not<00:02:11.600> be<00:02:11.870> recoverable<00:02:12.440> at<00:02:12.770> all<00:02:12.890> but

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
might not be recoverable at all but

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.240 
might not be recoverable at all but
we'll<00:02:14.030> find<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> brand<00:02:15.920> new<00:02:16.010> one

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
we'll find out this is a brand new one

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.800 
we'll find out this is a brand new one

it to you and give you a little close-up
this<00:02:56.480> guy<00:02:57.190> what's<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.700> hear<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:03.410> fact

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
this guy what's that can hear in fact

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.539 
this guy what's that can hear in fact
all<00:03:05.230> stop<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.530> play<00:03:06.860> with<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.130> here<00:03:07.310> for<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
all stop it play with it here for a

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.720 
all stop it play with it here for a
little<00:03:07.790> bit<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:11.170> install<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.350> thing<00:03:12.730> me

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
little bit that install the thing me

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.180 
little bit that install the thing me
back<00:03:14.000> back<00:03:14.480> out<00:03:14.780> I'll<00:03:15.019> show<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.739> what<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> got

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
back back out I'll show you what I got

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.470 
back back out I'll show you what I got
going<00:03:16.519> on<00:03:19.120> basically<00:03:20.120> I've<00:03:20.480> glued<00:03:20.750> on<00:03:22.480> four

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
going on basically I've glued on four

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.840 
going on basically I've glued on four
magnets<00:03:23.959> directly<00:03:24.440> onto<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.860> disc<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.489> then

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
magnets directly onto the disc and then

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.840 
magnets directly onto the disc and then
I<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:26.209> have<00:03:26.420> another<00:03:26.690> four<00:03:27.430> stuck<00:03:28.430> on<00:03:28.610> there

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
I just have another four stuck on there

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.410 
I just have another four stuck on there
magnetically<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.959> they<00:03:31.030> haven't<00:03:32.030> spun<00:03:32.239> off

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
magnetically and they haven't spun off

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.630 
magnetically and they haven't spun off
on<00:03:32.750> slower<00:03:33.049> speeds<00:03:33.440> they<00:03:33.709> might<00:03:33.950> spin<00:03:34.430> off<00:03:34.610> of

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
on slower speeds they might spin off of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.210 
on slower speeds they might spin off of
a<00:03:34.910> high<00:03:35.900> speed<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.620> maybe<00:03:37.100> not<00:03:38.079> anyway<00:03:39.220> I've

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
a high speed but maybe not anyway I've

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.789 
a high speed but maybe not anyway I've
already<00:03:40.310> had<00:03:40.610> problems<00:03:40.850> with<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.799> I'm

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
already had problems with that and I'm

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.979 
already had problems with that and I'm
being<00:03:43.400> conservative<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.299> point<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:44.900> I

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
being conservative this point because I

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.349 
being conservative this point because I
don't<00:03:45.109> wanna<00:03:45.230> lose<00:03:45.410> him<00:03:45.440> over<00:03:45.680> mangas<00:03:46.359> so

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
don't wanna lose him over mangas so

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.370 
don't wanna lose him over mangas so
there's<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.280> do<00:03:49.280> me<00:03:49.760> show<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.209> right<00:03:51.109> now

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
there's the do me show you right now

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.740 
there's the do me show you right now
after<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.040> reset<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.820> back<00:03:53.000> up<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.329> got<00:03:53.480> it's<00:03:53.600> been

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
after I reset it back up I got it's been

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.400 
after I reset it back up I got it's been
a<00:03:53.780> little<00:03:54.049> harder<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.470> get<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:55.190> going

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
a little harder to get it going

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.830 
a little harder to get it going
earlier<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.590> was<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:58.040> lot<00:03:58.820> easier<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:59.390> get<00:03:59.510> gone

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
earlier it was a lot easier to get gone

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.650 
earlier it was a lot easier to get gone
so<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.200> probably<00:04:00.890> have<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.220> tune<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.239> back<00:04:02.450> up

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
so I probably have to tune it back up

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.540 
so I probably have to tune it back up
again

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
again

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.440 
again
there's<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.819> deal<00:04:06.800> I<00:04:09.140> mean<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.620> think<00:04:11.610> this

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
there's the deal I mean I I think this

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.839 
there's the deal I mean I I think this
is<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.680> basically<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.920> great<00:04:14.159> bearing<00:04:14.670> that

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
is a basically it's a great bearing that

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.189 
is a basically it's a great bearing that
you're<00:04:15.000> using<00:04:15.799> it's<00:04:16.799> meant<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.100> spin<00:04:17.430> fast<00:04:18.199> so

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
you're using it's meant to spin fast so

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.960 
you're using it's meant to spin fast so
long<00:04:19.320> as<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.440> balance<00:04:19.769> everything<00:04:20.070> things

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
long as you balance everything things

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.469 
long as you balance everything things
should<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.440> pretty<00:04:22.440> cool<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.310> that's<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.300> deal

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
should be pretty cool so that's the deal

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.440 
should be pretty cool so that's the deal
all<00:04:24.990> right<00:04:25.020> yep
