00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
if you can get a closer look at them now

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.220 
if you can get a closer look at them now
if<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.160> embossing<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.940> round<00:02:18.270> cake<00:02:18.660> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
if your embossing on a round cake you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.980 
if your embossing on a round cake you
need<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.530> roll<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.800> emboss<00:02:20.430> er<00:02:20.780> around<00:02:21.780> the

need to roll the emboss er around the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.920 
need to roll the emboss er around the
cake<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.180> butterfly<00:02:24.510> here

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
cake and so like for this butterfly here

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.370 
cake and so like for this butterfly here
I'll<00:02:25.050> start<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.830> left<00:02:26.370> edge<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.380> keep

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I'll start on the left edge and keep

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.610 
I'll start on the left edge and keep
even<00:02:28.709> pressure<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.550> roll<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.760> around

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
even pressure on it and roll it around

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.580 
even pressure on it and roll it around
so<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.069> full<00:02:32.340> design<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.910> there

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
so that I get the full design on there

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590 
so that I get the full design on there
the<00:02:34.590> reason<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.100> want<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.400> roll<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.910> around<00:02:36.030> is

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
the reason you want to roll it around is

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.630 
the reason you want to roll it around is
if<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.989> just<00:02:37.020> placed<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> flat<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.340> only

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
if you just placed it flat on here only

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360 
if you just placed it flat on here only
the<00:02:38.790> center<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.989> design<00:02:40.140> would<00:02:40.500> show<00:02:40.890> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the center of the design would show so

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.600 
the center of the design would show so
by<00:02:41.610> rolling<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.890> from<00:02:43.890> left<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> right<00:02:44.430> or

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
by rolling it from left to right or

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.150 
by rolling it from left to right or
right<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.820> left<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.420> get<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.870> entire<00:02:46.650> design

the frill cutters and here's a frill

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
the frill cutters and here's a frill
cutter<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.660> these<00:02:57.780> kind<00:02:58.050> are<00:02:58.170> nice<00:02:58.290> because

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
they have an open end on each end so

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.870 
they have an open end on each end so
that<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.560> continue<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> design<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.700> one

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
that you can continue the design in one

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.920 
that you can continue the design in one
strip<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.910> scoot<00:03:06.209> along<00:03:06.330> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
strip and so I just scoot along and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.190 
strip and so I just scoot along and
match<00:03:07.230> up<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> design<00:03:08.180> where<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> ended<00:03:09.660> there

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
match up the design where it ended there

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.090 
match up the design where it ended there
and<00:03:10.590> press<00:03:11.190> down<00:03:11.430> again<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:13.050> a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
and press down again and I can get a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.289 
and press down again and I can get a
continuous<00:03:14.100> strip<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.670> wanted<00:03:14.940> all<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> way

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
continuous strip if I wanted all the way

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.840 
continuous strip if I wanted all the way
around<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.750> cake<00:03:15.959> or<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.769> pieces<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:19.670> I've<00:03:20.670> got

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
around the cake or in pieces so I've got

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.240 
around the cake or in pieces so I've got
myself<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.360> longer<00:03:21.870> silicone<00:03:22.590> mat<00:03:22.860> here<00:03:23.100> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
myself a longer silicone mat here to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
myself a longer silicone mat here to
roll<00:03:23.459> on<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:25.019> have<00:03:25.500> cut<00:03:25.890> out<00:03:26.540> strips<00:03:27.540> all

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
roll on and I have cut out strips all

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.380 
roll on and I have cut out strips all
along<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> nice<00:03:29.370> long<00:03:29.730> continuous

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
along so I get a nice long continuous

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.630 
along so I get a nice long continuous
piece<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.079> this<00:03:31.620> opening<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.340> cutter

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
piece and this opening on this cutter

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.780 
piece and this opening on this cutter
makes<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.120> easy<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:34.070> then<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.519> want

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
makes that easy to do then I just want

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.960 
makes that easy to do then I just want
to<00:03:35.910> cut<00:03:36.239> away<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.840> ones<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.190> non<00:03:38.370> scalloped

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
to cut away the ones the non scalloped

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.310 
to cut away the ones the non scalloped
side<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.660> kind<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:41.720> triangular<00:03:42.720> rickrack

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
side so kind of the triangular rickrack

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.090 
side so kind of the triangular rickrack
edge<00:03:43.620> here

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.430 

I'm<00:03:50.100> using<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.490> metal<00:03:50.640> ruler<00:03:51.210> so<00:03:51.570> that<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.960> keeps

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
I'm using a metal ruler so that it keeps

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.530

a<00:03:52.560> nice<00:03:52.740> straight<00:03:53.070> edge<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:56.360> wouldn't<00:03:57.360> cut

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
a nice straight edge and I wouldn't cut

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.410 
a nice straight edge and I wouldn't cut
off<00:03:57.660> any<00:03:57.870> wood<00:03:58.140> pieces<00:03:58.620> or<00:03:58.950> anything<00:03:59.210> onto<00:04:00.210> the
