00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
I started at channel 9 in 1992 and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.890 
I started at channel 9 in 1992 and
channel<00:00:17.260> 9<00:00:17.610> did<00:00:18.610> rugby<00:00:19.450> league<00:00:19.660> and

cricketers<00:00:20.650> their<00:00:20.830> two<00:00:20.980> main<00:00:21.130> sports<00:00:21.490> so<00:00:22.119> I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
cricketers their two main sports so I

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.690 
cricketers their two main sports so I
got<00:00:22.360> into<00:00:22.599> it<00:00:22.630> very<00:00:22.990> early<00:00:23.170> on<00:00:23.320> at<00:00:24.160> channel<00:00:24.550> 9

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
got into it very early on at channel 9

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.109 
got into it very early on at channel 9
and<00:00:24.730> then<00:00:25.000> came<00:00:25.240> here<00:00:25.450> in<00:00:25.710> 2004<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.119> started

and then came here in 2004 and started

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.010 
and then came here in 2004 and started
working<00:00:28.360> for<00:00:28.480> Sky

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
working for Sky

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.420 
working for Sky
I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:32.730> cricketers<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:35.280> probably<00:00:36.280> the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
I think cricketers is probably the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.030 
I think cricketers is probably the
hardest<00:00:36.879> sport<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.300> cover<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:38.040> simply

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
hardest sport to cover just simply

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.000 
hardest sport to cover just simply
because<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.430> a<00:00:39.489> very<00:00:39.699> long<00:00:39.850> day<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.500> off<00:00:41.500> the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
because it's a very long day and off the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.470 
because it's a very long day and off the
bat<00:00:42.190> you<00:00:42.430> don't<00:00:42.640> know<00:00:42.820> where<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.150> balls<00:00:43.330> going

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
bat you don't know where the balls going

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.899 
bat you don't know where the balls going
to<00:00:43.540> go<00:00:43.600> 360<00:00:44.140> degree<00:00:44.620> degrees<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.129> mean<00:00:45.280> Golf<00:00:45.729> is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
to go 360 degree degrees I mean Golf is

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.640 
to go 360 degree degrees I mean Golf is
very<00:00:46.120> difficult<00:00:46.629> but<00:00:47.170> you've<00:00:47.290> got<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.530> best

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
very difficult but you've got the best

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.149 
very difficult but you've got the best
players<00:00:47.979> in<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.220> world<00:00:49.440> aiming<00:00:50.440> at<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.769> pin

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
players in the world aiming at that pin

players in the world aiming at that pin
there<00:00:51.670> they're<00:00:52.059> not<00:00:52.089> going<00:00:52.299> to<00:00:52.390> hit<00:00:52.540> it<00:00:52.629> over

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
there they're not going to hit it over

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.270 
there they're not going to hit it over
there<00:00:53.049> I'm<00:00:53.379> not<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.650> to<00:00:53.710> hit<00:00:53.799> it<00:00:53.830> over<00:00:54.129> there

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
there I'm not going to hit it over there

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.170 
there I'm not going to hit it over there
they're<00:00:54.519> going<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.670> hit<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.909> straight<00:00:55.030> at<00:00:55.390> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
they're going to hit it straight at you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.860 
they're going to hit it straight at you
often<00:00:58.180> you'll<00:00:58.720> have<00:00:58.900> a<00:01:00.030> fielder<00:01:01.030> using<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:01.720> as

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
often you'll have a fielder using you as

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.360 
often you'll have a fielder using you as
a<00:01:01.900> marker<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.530> they'll<00:01:02.680> look<00:01:02.799> it<00:01:02.979> over<00:01:03.100> their

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
a marker so they'll look it over their

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.280 
a marker so they'll look it over their
shoulder<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.909> see<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.449> they're<00:01:04.839> standing
