00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
remote mineplex on that I think you

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.469 
remote mineplex on that I think you
should<00:06:16.650> probably<00:06:16.949> like<00:06:17.760> every<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:18.180> know<00:06:18.240> five

seconds<00:06:18.870> or<00:06:18.960> so<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.110> think<00:06:19.229> that's<00:06:19.530> it's<00:06:19.979> not

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
seconds or so I think that's it's not

seconds or so I think that's it's not
overdoing<00:06:20.610> it<00:06:20.930> right<00:06:21.930> yeah<00:06:22.110> yes<00:06:22.740> today's<00:06:23.490> cube
