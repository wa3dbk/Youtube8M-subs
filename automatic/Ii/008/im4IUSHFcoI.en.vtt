describe the functions of the lateral
corticospinal<00:00:19.080> tract<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.039> finally<00:00:20.880> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
corticospinal tract and finally you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
corticospinal tract and finally you
should<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.210> able<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> identify<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.350> describe

the<00:00:23.070> motor<00:00:23.250> toppy<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> lateral

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the motor toppy of the lateral

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.130 
the motor toppy of the lateral
corticospinal<00:00:24.480> tract<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
corticospinal tract so this is a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
corticospinal tract so this is a
histological<00:00:28.439> preparation<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.939> cervical

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.080 
spinal cord axons of myelin are saying
black<00:00:32.899> as<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:35.090> while

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
black as you can see here while

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
black as you can see here while

and from lower spinal levels since we're
talking<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> axonal<00:01:00.449> tracts<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
talking about the axonal tracts in this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
talking about the axonal tracts in this
video<00:01:01.320> we'll<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.250> focused<00:01:02.730> primarily<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
video we'll be focused primarily on the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320 
video we'll be focused primarily on the
black<00:01:03.660> areas<00:01:04.760> when<00:01:05.760> we're<00:01:05.850> talking<00:01:05.970> about<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
black areas when we're talking about the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.219 
black areas when we're talking about the
descending<00:01:06.750> tracts

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
descending tracts

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.270 
descending tracts
these<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.470> tracts<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.890> generally

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
these are tracts that are generally

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
these are tracts that are generally
considered<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.030> murder<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.570> function

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
considered to be murder and function

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
considered to be murder and function
well<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.590> form<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.430> information

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
well they form a with information

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.460 
well they form a with information
traveling<00:01:12.270> down<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> spinal<00:01:12.869> cord<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
traveling down the spinal cord from the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
traveling down the spinal cord from the
brain<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.950> first<00:01:14.909> track<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> lateral

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
brain the first track is a lateral

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.820 
brain the first track is a lateral
corticospinal<00:01:15.930> tract

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
corticospinal tract

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.850 
corticospinal tract
I'll<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.310> my<00:01:17.460> pen<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:19.439> said<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
I'll get my pen and said a lot of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.749 
I'll get my pen and said a lot of
cortical<00:01:20.310> spinal<00:01:20.490> tract<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.000> located<00:01:22.759> just

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
cortical spinal tract is located just

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.640 
cortical spinal tract is located just
about<00:01:24.090> here

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:39.210 

here

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.860 

so<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:39.940> is<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.090> first<00:01:40.240> major<00:01:40.390> track<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.780> be

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
so this is the first major track to be

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.750 
so this is the first major track to be
aware<00:01:41.050> of<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:41.590> contains<00:01:41.950> axons<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.550> upper

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
aware of this contains axons of upper

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.370 
aware of this contains axons of upper
motor<00:01:42.880> neurons<00:01:43.360> whose<00:01:43.540> cell<00:01:43.780> bodies<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
motor neurons whose cell bodies and the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.470 
motor neurons whose cell bodies and the
lower<00:01:44.620> are<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.430> motor<00:01:45.610> cortex<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
lower are in the motor cortex and the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.610 
lower are in the motor cortex and the
precentral<00:01:46.900> gyrus<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:49.300> axons<00:01:49.840> connect<00:01:50.200> here

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
precentral gyrus so axons connect here

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.430 
precentral gyrus so axons connect here
and<00:01:51.120> lower<00:01:52.120> motor<00:01:52.330> neurons<00:01:52.660> sitting<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.320> the

and lower motor neurons sitting in the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.240 
and lower motor neurons sitting in the
ventral<00:01:53.680> horns<00:01:54.040> are<00:01:54.490> who<00:01:54.730> are<00:01:55.120> receiving

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
ventral horns are who are receiving

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.040 
ventral horns are who are receiving
input<00:01:57.250> from<00:01:57.370> these<00:01:57.520> guys<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.660> you<00:01:58.750> can<00:01:58.870> imagine

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
input from these guys so you can imagine

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.360 
input from these guys so you can imagine

upper extremity come out narrate the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.229 
upper extremity come out narrate the
motor<00:03:44.769> neurons<00:03:45.190> like<00:03:45.459> we<00:03:45.580> talked<00:03:45.790> about<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.120> a

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
motor neurons like we talked about in a

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.910 
motor neurons like we talked about in a
previous<00:03:46.540> slide<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.520> also<00:03:49.080> for<00:03:50.080> more<00:03:50.440> lateral

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
previous slide but also for more lateral

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.680 
previous slide but also for more lateral
or<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.400> thoracic<00:03:51.550> motor

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
or the thoracic motor

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.380 
or the thoracic motor
axons<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.460> these<00:03:54.580> upper<00:03:54.910> motor<00:03:55.060> neuron

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
axons and so these upper motor neuron

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.420 
axons and so these upper motor neuron
axons<00:03:55.750> are<00:03:56.020> traveling<00:03:56.410> down<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.070> Alerus

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
axons are traveling down to the Alerus

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.670 
axons are traveling down to the Alerus
in<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.610> spinal<00:03:57.940> cord<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:59.200> as<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.530> can<00:03:59.620> see

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
in the spinal cord and as you can see

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.980 
in the spinal cord and as you can see
here<00:04:00.100> at<00:04:00.430> cervical<00:04:01.000> levels<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.780> have<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
here at cervical levels you have the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.300 
here at cervical levels you have the
upper<00:04:02.110> extremity<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:04.300> trunk<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.410> then<00:04:06.100> lower

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
upper extremity the trunk and then lower

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.930 
upper extremity the trunk and then lower
extremity

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
extremity

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.320 
extremity
so<00:04:07.750> these<00:04:07.870> up<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.110> murdered<00:04:08.350> neuron<00:04:08.560> axons

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
so these up and murdered neuron axons

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.090 
so these up and murdered neuron axons
and<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:10.600> here<00:04:11.020> these<00:04:11.350> axons<00:04:11.740> are<00:04:11.800> going<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.040> be

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
and so here these axons are going to be

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.220 
and so here these axons are going to be
traveling<00:04:12.400> down<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.670> trunk<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.960> trunk

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
traveling down to the trunk so a trunk

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.990 
traveling down to the trunk so a trunk
levels<00:04:14.650> these<00:04:15.130> guys<00:04:15.370> are<00:04:15.490> coming<00:04:15.580> out<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.870 
levels these guys are coming out and
look<00:04:19.630> Sherman<00:04:20.019> axon<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:20.590> continue<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.459> descend

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
look Sherman axon so continue to descend

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.390 
look Sherman axon so continue to descend

to the lumbar and sacral levels and here

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.580 
to the lumbar and sacral levels and here
these<00:04:24.640> axons<00:04:25.030> are<00:04:25.120> coming<00:04:25.330> out<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:26.230> innervate

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
these axons are coming out to innervate
