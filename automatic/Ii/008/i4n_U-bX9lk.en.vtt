first tower towers are the strategic

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.590 
first tower towers are the strategic
points<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:21.979> set<00:01:22.340> where<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.119> want<00:01:23.450> my

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
defenses to start from these can be

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.670 
defenses to start from these can be
connected<00:01:28.310> by<00:01:28.610> walls<00:01:28.910> or<00:01:29.300> large<00:01:29.690> gates<00:01:30.020> so

attach a tower to this wall so now I can

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.009 
attach a tower to this wall so now I can
see<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.370> my<00:03:18.519> defenses<00:03:19.150> are<00:03:19.329> connected<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.900> my

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
see that my defenses are connected to my

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.280 
see that my defenses are connected to my
castle<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.030> now<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:22.480> very<00:03:22.750> important

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
castle and now one very important

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.380 
castle and now one very important
feature<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.310> can<00:03:24.579> of<00:03:24.700> course<00:03:24.940> send

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
feature is that I can of course send

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.430 
feature is that I can of course send
units<00:03:25.780> up<00:03:26.019> onto<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> walls<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:29.019> instance

I'm going to use two workers of course

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.050 
I'm going to use two workers of course
this<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.410> really<00:03:32.650> useful<00:03:32.980> later<00:03:33.400> on<00:03:33.579> with
