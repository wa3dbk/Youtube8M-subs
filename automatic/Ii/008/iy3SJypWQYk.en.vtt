head<00:00:55.519> you're<00:00:56.519> really<00:00:56.760> working<00:00:56.910> well

I'm<00:01:03.550> also<00:01:03.699> switched<00:01:04.449> over<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:07.680> 15<00:01:08.680> millimeter

seems<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.799> improved<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.250> accuracy<00:01:16.200> as

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
seems to have improved the accuracy as

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
well layer quality is actually looking

well layer quality is actually looking
pretty<00:01:22.390> good<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.440> can<00:01:24.399> get<00:01:24.549> it<00:01:24.670> focused<00:01:25.060> here

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.990 

you<00:01:47.410> may<00:01:47.530> notice<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.920> tape<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.580> hot<00:01:48.730> end

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
you may notice the tape on the hot end

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.480 
you may notice the tape on the hot end
there<00:01:49.650> what<00:01:50.650> we're<00:01:50.830> finding<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.250> at<00:01:51.370> these

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
there what we're finding is at these

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.530 
there what we're finding is at these
speeds<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.920> have<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.250> have<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.400> fan<00:01:54.760> on<00:01:55.090> the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
speeds we have to have a fan on the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.680 
speeds we have to have a fan on the
barrel<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.590> J<00:01:56.890> hot<00:01:57.100> end<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.670> keep<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
barrel of this J hot end to keep the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.430 
barrel of this J hot end to keep the
filament<00:01:59.230> from<00:01:59.440> jamming<00:01:59.920> inside<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:01.480> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
filament from jamming inside the the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.410 
filament from jamming inside the the
neck<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:05.640> putting<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.790> fan<00:02:06.970> there<00:02:07.210> really

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
neck but putting a fan there really

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:34.210 
neck but putting a fan there really
makes<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.840> big<00:02:07.990> difference

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.110 

and<00:02:34.790> we're<00:02:35.120> working<00:02:35.270> on<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> pup<00:02:36.400> over<00:02:37.400> there

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.970 

this<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:42.130> main<00:02:43.130> curb<00:02:43.430> last<00:02:43.700> year
