the<00:01:08.430> front<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.759> i<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:10.229> they

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the front and i think that is what they

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
the front and i think that is what they
referring<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.009> as<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.190> kill<00:01:11.670> switch<00:01:11.959> which<00:01:12.959> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
referring to as the kill switch which is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.770 
referring to as the kill switch which is
this<00:01:13.289> button<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.060> acts<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this button right here this acts as the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.910 
this button right here this acts as the
button<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.410> fire<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.670> blade<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.270> also<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
button to fire the blade and also as a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
button to fire the blade and also as a
locking<00:01:20.520> mechanism<00:01:20.550> sell<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.390> way<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.720> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
locking mechanism sell the way that it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.859 
locking mechanism sell the way that it
works<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.399> right<00:01:23.399> now<00:01:23.550> it's<00:01:23.819> on<00:01:23.940> safety<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
works is right now it's on safety so

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.020 
works is right now it's on safety so
when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.110> push<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.349> button<00:01:25.410> nothing<00:01:25.800> happens

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
go push the button and the fighters so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
go push the button and the fighters so
those<00:01:38.160> are<00:01:38.190> why<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.550> automatic<00:01:39.000> only<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
those are why it's automatic only be the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.219 
those are why it's automatic only be the
handle<00:01:39.899> is<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.229> dimpled<00:01:41.539> recessed<00:01:42.539> area<00:01:42.899> here

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
handle is the dimpled recessed area here

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
handle is the dimpled recessed area here
dimple<00:01:43.679> recessed<00:01:44.039> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> blade<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.750> is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
dimple recessed on the blade this is

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.529 
dimple recessed on the blade this is
more<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.349> aggressive<00:01:46.729> blade<00:01:47.729> grind<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
more of an aggressive blade grind it's

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.210 
more of an aggressive blade grind it's
different<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.319> previous<00:01:49.709> play<00:01:49.890> grinds

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
different than the previous play grinds

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910 
different than the previous play grinds
I<00:01:50.599> think<00:01:51.599> someone<00:01:51.959> has<00:01:52.080> referred<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.860> as

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I think someone has referred to this as

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
I think someone has referred to this as
a<00:01:53.099> nightmare<00:01:53.759> grind<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.330> I'm<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:55.020> sure<00:01:55.130> as

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a nightmare grind but I'm not sure as

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.889 
a nightmare grind but I'm not sure as
you<00:01:56.220> can<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:56.520> how<00:01:56.670> has<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.910> deep<00:01:57.239> indentation

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you can see how has a deep indentation

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.169 
you can see how has a deep indentation
there<00:01:58.410> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> groin<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.700> has<00:01:59.940> more

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
there in the groin and then it has more

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.199 
there in the groin and then it has more
of<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.330> shallow<00:02:00.599> grind<00:02:01.020> them<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> tip<00:02:02.209> you

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
of a shallow grind them for the tip you

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.880 
of a shallow grind them for the tip you
can<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.569> there<00:02:05.420> on<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.539> neck<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.500> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
can see that there on the neck so this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.830 
can see that there on the neck so this
feature<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.250> pretty<00:02:08.399> nice<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> guess

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
feature is pretty nice this is I guess

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.229 
feature is pretty nice this is I guess

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
we're cheating the lock backwards so you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.260 
we're cheating the lock backwards so you
just<00:02:30.410> see<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:31.680> how<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.920> rotates

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.420 

following<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:37.740> ready<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.190> means

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
following and when it's ready it means

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.850 
following and when it's ready it means
it's<00:02:38.610> ready<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.880> go<00:02:39.000> ready<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.510> fire<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:40.830> on

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
it's ready to go ready to fire so put on

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.000 
it's ready to go ready to fire so put on
safety<00:02:41.100> nothing<00:02:41.910> happens<00:02:42.800> put<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.890> boy<00:02:43.980> down

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
safety nothing happens put the boy down

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.210 
safety nothing happens put the boy down
rotate<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.880> forward<00:02:45.260> fires<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.100> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
rotate it forward fires so this is a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
rotate it forward fires so this is a
really<00:02:50.459> interesting<00:02:51.090> design<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:52.050> I

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
really interesting design so you have I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.230 
really interesting design so you have I
don't<00:02:52.740> know<00:02:52.890> how<00:02:53.430> they're<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> do<00:02:54.120> this

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
don't know how they're going to do this

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.640 
don't know how they're going to do this
in<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.510> production<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.110> enough<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.530> going

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
in the production of enough that's going

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.860 
in the production of enough that's going
to<00:02:55.740> make<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.580> production<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:57.180> would<00:02:57.750> assume

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
to make it to production I would assume

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.850 
to make it to production I would assume
it<00:02:58.350> would<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:59.130> again<00:02:59.520> I<00:03:00.300> don't<00:03:00.750> know<00:03:01.050> it's

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
it would but again I don't know it's

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.350 
it would but again I don't know it's
just<00:03:01.950> speculation<00:03:02.220> by<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.790> point<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.150> right

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
just speculation by this point so right

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.530 
just speculation by this point so right
now<00:03:03.390> they<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.900> these<00:03:03.990> prototypes<00:03:05.540> it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
now they do have these prototypes it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.990 
now they do have these prototypes it
comes<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.100> standard<00:03:08.550> zipper

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000
