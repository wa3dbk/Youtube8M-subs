00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
transformation well actually let's first

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.870 
transformation well actually let's first
let's<00:00:36.990> look<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.200> trailer<00:00:37.470> so<00:00:37.800> let's<00:00:38.670> get

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
let's look at the trailer so let's get

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.090 
let's look at the trailer so let's get
Prime<00:00:39.150> out<00:00:39.330> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.720> now<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.650> trailer

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
Prime out of the way for now the trailer

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.510 
Prime out of the way for now the trailer
you<00:00:41.880> can<00:00:41.970> see<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.600> gun<00:00:42.810> sorry<00:00:43.650> is<00:00:43.830> clipped<00:00:44.400> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you can see the gun sorry is clipped in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
you can see the gun sorry is clipped in
here<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> trailer<00:00:45.330> is<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.540> tight<00:00:45.990> for

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
here because the trailer is so tight for

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.960 
here because the trailer is so tight for
space<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.220> clip<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> gun<00:00:47.700> underneath

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
space so you can clip the gun underneath

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.460 
space so you can clip the gun underneath
so<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.660> goes<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:48.990> for<00:00:49.110> storage

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
so it goes there for storage

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and he's kind of chunkier to match up

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.530 
and he's kind of chunkier to match up
the<00:01:57.240> other<00:01:57.390> ones<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.230> transformation<00:01:59.540> similar
