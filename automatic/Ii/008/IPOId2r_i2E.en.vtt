00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:16.599
 and finally many expect it and I also 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.520
 I have time and many have asked me 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.529
 so upload a video of the new 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.289
 character customization 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.779
 we followed the menu in my case I started the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.750
 second tab we give you and there are three 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.759
 guys first the skills then 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.640
 that with these little dots that are achieved 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.250
 in missions then unlock different 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.649
 skills as they say their name 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.020
 obviously and good there are several types 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.650
 stealth health and so on we are 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.110
 enhancers that the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.800
 much what it is but 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.800
 it's my life 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.190
 I do not know I have to look and what I 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.489
 you have asked is this selection of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.840
 team first weapons here are the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 one-handed weapons 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 what is so cool that as you see first 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.720
 you buy and then there's like there 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.250
 hack once you have bought the weapon 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.090
 I do not think you 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.960
 it puts you better not to pirate and instead of 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.210
 use money then use the haches 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.490
 it's pretty good and you see if the bars 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.229
 you get red damage and stop means 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.080
 which are worse than the one you're carrying 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.290
 currently and if they are golden it is that they are 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.600
 better if they are white is that it is the same 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.820
 Well the long ones are the spears that I 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.060
 I really like the truth but I'm 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:47.360
 saving to buy me this is this 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.850
 this is this molar the heavy ones of all 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.670
 life now I carry this sword that is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.690
 pretty of billet and good the typical not 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.860
 the huge ax 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.200
 this I'm so guns that took this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.900
 of six guns there is nine and 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.950
 I want to buy this one that is super cool 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.950
 from paraguay blog 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.260
 of those missions to unlock 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:20.439
 some weapons here a blunderbuss 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.120
 I had a blunderbuss this blunderbuss and 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.310
 you have three guards together 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.150
 they burst the three 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.260
 and right now it's not knowing 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.620
 I bought one I did not know 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.049
 our are more good but it is not lethal 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.770
 and this is from the expansion of the kings 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.620
 dead 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.780
 but well this looks like I think 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.560
 the dlc are going to give us for what 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.739
 he went through 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.800
 framerate and all that but I will 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.860
 another video if I have time 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.370
 functioning of this that is the skill 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.370
 what do you currently have 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.730
 I really do not 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 you are shit 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.860
 and I have this but I do not know how to do it 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:16.660
 and equipment that is what interests 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.380
 first of all tell you that as you see 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.570
 you can change the bracelet but not 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.280
 change because you have to 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.510
 make sure you do not have any 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.200
 of those in the outfits 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.430
 now I this 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.430
 the king napoleon 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.260
 that you have to make sure that you do not 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.349
 you carry none is if I take it off me 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.860
 puts the original suit what are the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:50.020
 colors that we can choose among several 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.020
 although there are some that I do not like much 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.830
 this depends or 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.580
 this is a lot like a plan 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.550
 you were Venetian 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.070
 let's head here the customization 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.990
 just like weapons, not because you look at the body 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.780
 to body health the distance what more 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.780
 interest you in this case came until 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.770
 I do not know why he took it like that by sight 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.770
 of help more than anything 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.340
 and I buy him from this although to me 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.780
 like the serving system 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.120
 personalization that does not vocalize but does not 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.200
 I like the hoods that have put the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.590
 true 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.310
 that is my opinion 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.600
 you do not have to respect it 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.730
 let's buy some is 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.730
 club competition we will be at the same time 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.780
 and this but I can not buy it 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.010
 then the chest then it arrived is 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.010
 currently but there are many 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.790
 well well 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.360
 well you can see all can be improved 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.710
 the modifications do not give you health and the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.460
 improvements 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.289
 I like this 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.330
 the season pack we have to talk about it in 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.300
 a video why 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.449
 I do not know what happened the painting is one of the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.449
 things that go well because they add 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.999
 spaces in the inventory 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.909
 this is like club competition 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:27.000
 I have to do that and record it also what 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:30.000
 I have been right now 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.280
 more you see each one is more centered 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.080
 time is that distance 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.540
 this is more health distance health stealth 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.340
 I like to go in stealth 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.680
 but not this game that the combat is 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.020
 very good legs 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.620
 there of damage by falls and so on 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.449
 etc 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.100
 and the outfits I'm going to wear the same 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.100
 because I do not like him 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.820
 This is rock as I liked the 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:01.040
 red I shit on everything 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.020
 I will not upload anything because I can not 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.780
 record it but I'll wear the outfit 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:10.240
 because more than anything I do not like 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.240
 the body parts that it carries but 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.710
 and this has been all if you have some 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.870
 doubt then you can ask ore 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.379
 leave it to me in the comments if you have 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.080
 blake or fried foods and nothing that has 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.639
 liked the video 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.409
 your like basically we see each other in the 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.550
 next meets and asks all 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.830
 things that you want that I will try 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.900
 solve them and see you in the next 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.900
 video until then goodbye
