00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.869 
cover it looks like the front screen I'm
curious<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.100> whether<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
curious to see whether or not it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.810 
curious to see whether or not it
provides<00:00:48.809> coverage<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.440> underneath<00:00:49.820> this

spot<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.800> because<00:00:52.800> some<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> pictures

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
spot here because some of the pictures

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
spot here because some of the pictures
I've<00:00:53.399> seen<00:00:53.430> implied<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I've seen implied that it just kind of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.660 
I've seen implied that it just kind of
it's<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> cutaway<00:00:56.579> opening<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.360> anyway<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's a cutaway opening here anyway so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.619 
it's a cutaway opening here anyway so
that's<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> curve<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's what the curve which is going to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.399 
that's what the curve which is going to
look<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> case<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:04.260> the

a<00:01:16.200> generic<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.030> doesn't<00:01:18.330> cover<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
a generic one and doesn't cover the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.940 
a generic one and doesn't cover the
buttons<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.740> mean

because I put this part in first so the
most<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.880> problem<00:02:44.150> i<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.360> right<00:02:44.599> here<00:02:45.220> so

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
most the problem i have is right here so

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.740 
most the problem i have is right here so
that<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.580> only<00:02:46.700> problem<00:02:46.850> I've<00:02:47.299> had<00:02:47.330> with

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
that is the only problem I've had with

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.350 
that is the only problem I've had with
invisible<00:02:48.230> shield<00:02:48.910> combined<00:02:49.910> with<00:02:50.209> the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
invisible shield combined with the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.250 
invisible shield combined with the
silicone<00:02:50.750> case<00:02:50.989> is<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.810> starts<00:02:54.170> to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
silicone case is that it starts to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.750 
silicone case is that it starts to
really<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.920> ugly<00:02:55.250> right<00:02:55.400> right<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.530> so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
really get ugly right right there so

gonna make it a point that when you put
it<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:07.099> snag<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.640> part<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.030> first

of a deal when the screen is on when the

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.949 
of a deal when the screen is on when the
screen<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:37.880> off<00:03:38.090> then<00:03:38.329> you<00:03:38.450> can<00:03:38.600> kind<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.900> see

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
screen is off then you can kind of see

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.559 
screen is off then you can kind of see
although<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:40.370> can't<00:03:40.640> tell<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.150> much<00:03:41.269> on<00:03:41.420> this

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
although you can't tell so much on this

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.210 
although you can't tell so much on this
then<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.230> back<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.920> i<00:03:42.950> think<00:03:43.190> part

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
then you can the back and i think part

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.949 
then you can the back and i think part
of<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.519> reason<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.910> because<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.450> back<00:03:44.660> is

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
of the reason is because the back is

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.920 
of the reason is because the back is
that<00:03:45.590> that<00:03:46.340> flat<00:03:46.700> finish<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.389> the<00:03:47.750> phone

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
that that flat finish of the phone

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.370 
that that flat finish of the phone
revision<00:03:48.260> lee<00:03:48.350> has<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.500> pet<00:03:48.739> flat<00:03:49.190> finish<00:03:49.489> so
