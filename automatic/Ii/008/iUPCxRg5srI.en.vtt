problem is depending on the size of the
container<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.820> get<00:02:02.969> very<00:02:03.030> heavy<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> past

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
container it can get very heavy so past

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.270 
container it can get very heavy so past
is<00:02:05.369> good<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:07.560> other<00:02:07.680> thing<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.009> could<00:02:08.129> also

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
is good one other thing you could also

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.969 
is good one other thing you could also
use<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.819> these<00:02:08.970> containers<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.979> an

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
use with these containers is an

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.990 
use with these containers is an
expanding<00:02:11.670> following<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> gap

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
expanding following the gap

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520 
expanding following the gap
now<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.720> recommended<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.410> is

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
now this is what I recommended this is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.880 
now this is what I recommended this is
what<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> prefer<00:02:14.920> once<00:02:15.580> i<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:15.880> some<00:02:16.620> some<00:02:17.620> more

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
what I prefer once i get some some more

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.440 
what I prefer once i get some some more
of<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.130> I've<00:02:18.280> ran<00:02:18.490> out<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.790> will<00:02:19.150> show<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.360> how

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
of it I've ran out I will show you how

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.660 
of it I've ran out I will show you how
to<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.380> that's<00:02:20.530> awesome<00:02:21.160> look<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:21.640> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
to do it but that's awesome look for a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.710 
to do it but that's awesome look for a
low<00:02:21.940> expansion<00:02:22.540> gap<00:02:23.440> filler<00:02:23.830> from<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.370> can

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
low expansion gap filler from a can

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.240 
low expansion gap filler from a can
comes<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:26.830> pick<00:02:26.950> out<00:02:27.040> from

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
comes in a can you can pick out from

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
comes in a can you can pick out from

spray the foam into it normally they

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.500 
spray the foam into it normally they
have<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> long<00:02:39.190> tube<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> can<00:02:40.360> get

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510

and expand over everything that's fine

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.210 
and expand over everything that's fine
it's<00:02:49.360> very<00:02:49.540> easy<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.989> cut<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.890> stuff's
