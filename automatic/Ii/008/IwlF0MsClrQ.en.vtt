I<00:03:10.819> guess<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.510> started<00:03:11.870> getting<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> point

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
I guess I started getting to the point

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.680 
I guess I started getting to the point
where<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:13.129> let<00:03:13.550> all<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.879> walls<00:03:14.120> down<00:03:14.480> in

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
where I just I let all the walls down in

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.990 
where I just I let all the walls down in
my<00:03:14.840> mind<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.470> what<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.459> could<00:03:16.730> do<00:03:16.849> with

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
my mind of what I could do with

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.910 
my mind of what I could do with
motorcycles<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:18.200> took<00:03:18.409> me<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> point

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
motorcycles it took me to the point

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.740 
motorcycles it took me to the point
where<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.400> wasn't<00:03:19.670> intimidated<00:03:20.390> anymore

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
where I I wasn't intimidated anymore

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.080 
where I I wasn't intimidated anymore
just<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.110> rip<00:03:21.950> all<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.400> wiring<00:03:22.610> out<00:03:22.909> of<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
just to rip all the wiring out of the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.390 
just to rip all the wiring out of the
bike<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.569> start<00:03:24.140> completely<00:03:24.500> over<00:03:24.620> again<00:03:25.099> I

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.600 
bike and start completely over again I
think<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.879> was<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> huge<00:03:26.569> step<00:03:27.140> in<00:03:27.610> actually

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
think I was a huge step in actually

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.449 
think I was a huge step in actually
starting<00:03:29.060> Nash<00:03:29.239> motorcycle<00:03:29.930> company<00:03:30.310> once<00:03:31.310> I

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
starting Nash motorcycle company once I

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.009 
starting Nash motorcycle company once I
made<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.819> decision<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.480> knew<00:03:32.629> I<00:03:32.660> could<00:03:32.930> go

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
made that decision I knew I could go

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.449 
made that decision I knew I could go
full-on<00:03:33.379> into<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.670> not<00:03:35.060> look<00:03:35.269> back<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:37.010> so

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
full-on into it and not look back I'm so

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.940 
full-on into it and not look back I'm so
proud<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.790> Tabor<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.200> reason<00:03:39.470> why<00:03:39.590> I'm<00:03:39.769> so

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950
