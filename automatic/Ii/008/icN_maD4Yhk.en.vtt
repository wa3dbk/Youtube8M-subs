already seen the other video but Arnav

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.069 
already seen the other video but Arnav
stands<00:00:21.009> for<00:00:21.220> area<00:00:21.720> navigation<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:22.960> that's

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
stands for area navigation and that's

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.679 
stands for area navigation and that's
where<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.380> acronym<00:00:23.800> comes<00:00:24.039> from<00:00:24.689> Arnav

where the acronym comes from Arnav

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.450 
where the acronym comes from Arnav
allows<00:00:25.930> you<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.199> put<00:00:26.380> many<00:00:26.590> more<00:00:26.769> waypoints<00:00:27.340> in

zdenka at 7,000 feet and 220 knots and
our<00:02:47.480> controller<00:02:48.480> has<00:02:48.689> just<00:02:48.900> given<00:02:49.019> us<00:02:49.230> the

our controller has just given us the

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.039 
our controller has just given us the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
7,000 feet 220 knots so the first thing

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.159 
7,000 feet 220 knots so the first thing
we<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.480> we're<00:02:54.840> checking<00:02:55.400> our<00:02:56.400> FMS<00:02:57.419> to<00:02:57.840> see

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
we do is we're checking our FMS to see

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.220 
we do is we're checking our FMS to see
that<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.739> FMS<00:02:59.430> actually<00:03:00.919> covers<00:03:01.919> off<00:03:02.069> that

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that the FMS actually covers off that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.080 
that the FMS actually covers off that
altitude<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> speed<00:03:04.560> restriction<00:03:05.340> properly

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.599 
altitude and speed restriction properly
which<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.449> does<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.829> second<00:03:08.129> thing<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.430> we

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
which it does and the second thing is we

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.569 
which it does and the second thing is we
want<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.909> make<00:03:09.030> sure<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.629> we<00:03:10.519> begin<00:03:11.519> our

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.589 
want to make sure that we begin our
descent<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.419> cross<00:03:13.669> the<00:03:14.669> intersection<00:03:15.060> at

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
error we see pilots make on vatsim is

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.240 
error we see pilots make on vatsim is
that<00:03:21.060> when<00:03:21.900> they're<00:03:22.049> given<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.620> instruction

their flight unnecessarily long number

their flight unnecessarily long number
two<00:03:45.720> though<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.019> does<00:03:46.199> create<00:03:46.409> problems<00:03:46.859> for

two though it does create problems for

two though it does create problems for
the<00:03:47.159> for<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> controller<00:03:48.659> because<00:03:49.139> if<00:03:49.379> he<00:03:49.560> has

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
the for the controller because if he has

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.770 
the for the controller because if he has
aircraft<00:03:51.419> nicely<00:03:51.959> spaced<00:03:52.290> once<00:03:52.979> that

and<00:05:18.969> the<00:05:19.569> rest<00:05:19.749> is<00:05:19.929> pretty<00:05:19.990> straightforward

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:20.649 
and the rest is pretty straightforward

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.079 
and the rest is pretty straightforward
stuff<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:21.129> can<00:05:21.309> descend<00:05:21.639> with<00:05:21.819> the<00:05:21.909> glide

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
stuff you can descend with the glide

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.429 
stuff you can descend with the glide
slope<00:05:22.119> and<00:05:22.629> then<00:05:22.719> you'll<00:05:22.839> be<00:05:22.869> handed<00:05:23.199> over<00:05:23.259> to

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:23.439 
slope and then you'll be handed over to

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:30.089 
slope and then you'll be handed over to
tower<00:05:24.099> for<00:05:24.580> your<00:05:24.789> landing<00:05:25.119> clearance<00:05:29.099> the

next<00:05:30.339> thing<00:05:30.459> I'd<00:05:30.550> like<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.789> discuss<00:05:31.119> is<00:05:31.360> the

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
next thing I'd like to discuss is the

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.079 
next thing I'd like to discuss is the
same<00:05:32.499> arrival<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:33.069> Ragged<00:05:33.369> to<00:05:33.490> arrival<00:05:33.909> but

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:34.089 
same arrival the Ragged to arrival but

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.230 
same arrival the Ragged to arrival but
this<00:05:34.240> time<00:05:34.479> landing<00:05:34.809> to<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.919> east<00:05:36.129> I'll<00:05:37.059> use

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
this time landing to the east I'll use

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.149 
this time landing to the east I'll use

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
the example of runway 0 6 left so you

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.489

a clearance down to 3,000 feet if you're
in<00:06:11.949> the<00:06:12.039> US<00:06:12.369> you<00:06:12.639> can<00:06:12.669> descend<00:06:13.330> at<00:06:13.539> your

in the US you can descend at your
discretion<00:06:13.899> to<00:06:14.259> 3,000<00:06:14.800> feet<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:14.979> ignore<00:06:15.550> all

discretion to 3,000 feet and ignore all
previous<00:06:15.879> restrictions<00:06:16.809> but<00:06:17.469> in<00:06:17.740> Canada<00:06:18.249> you

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:18.429 
previous restrictions but in Canada you

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:20.249 
previous restrictions but in Canada you
must<00:06:18.729> adhere<00:06:18.999> to<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:19.599> altitude<00:06:19.839> restriction

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
must adhere to the altitude restriction

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.239 
must adhere to the altitude restriction
so<00:06:20.619> you<00:06:20.679> are<00:06:20.919> expected<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:22.649> cross<00:06:23.649> slur<00:06:24.099> at

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 
so you are expected to cross slur at

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.850 
so you are expected to cross slur at
between<00:06:24.729> 15<00:06:25.119> and<00:06:25.149> 7<00:06:25.539> thousand<00:06:25.869> feet<00:06:26.019> and<00:06:26.199> 250

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
between 15 and 7 thousand feet and 250

between 15 and 7 thousand feet and 250
knots<00:06:27.069> and<00:06:27.459> etc<00:06:28.180> down<00:06:28.509> the<00:06:28.659> line<00:06:28.839> so<00:06:29.139> that's

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
knots and etc down the line so that's

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.809 
knots and etc down the line so that's
just<00:06:29.469> a<00:06:29.680> very<00:06:29.919> critical<00:06:30.399> thing<00:06:30.779> when<00:06:31.779> you're

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
just a very critical thing when you're

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.139 
just a very critical thing when you're
descending<00:06:34.139> on<00:06:35.139> some<00:06:35.469> of<00:06:35.589> these<00:06:35.709> stars<00:06:36.039> in<00:06:36.399> in

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:37.149 
descending on some of these stars in in

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:39.569 
descending on some of these stars in in
Canada<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:38.800> other<00:06:38.919> thing<00:06:39.159> to<00:06:39.279> do<00:06:39.399> of<00:06:39.550> course

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:39.579 
Canada the other thing to do of course

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:42.480 
Canada the other thing to do of course
is<00:06:40.029> to<00:06:40.300> just<00:06:40.689> check<00:06:41.259> your<00:06:41.439> FMS<00:06:41.919> to<00:06:42.069> make<00:06:42.219> sure

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
is to just check your FMS to make sure

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.029 
is to just check your FMS to make sure
that<00:06:42.849> the<00:06:43.419> altitude<00:06:44.079> restrictions<00:06:44.649> are<00:06:44.800> met

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
that the altitude restrictions are met

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.799 
that the altitude restrictions are met
so<00:06:45.459> that<00:06:46.079> you<00:06:47.079> are<00:06:47.289> complying<00:06:48.009> with<00:06:48.159> what<00:06:48.939> is
