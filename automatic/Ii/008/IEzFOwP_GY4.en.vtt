so<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.329> run<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.130> statically<00:00:23.130> without<00:00:23.489> any

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
so you can run it statically without any

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.779 
so you can run it statically without any
problem<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> long<00:00:25.050> period<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> time<00:00:25.789> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
problem for a long period of time this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.740 
problem for a long period of time this
is<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.960> weak<00:00:28.439> test<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.400> make<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.509> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
is just a weak test to make sure all the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.890 
is just a weak test to make sure all the
welds<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.679> totally<00:00:32.070> leak<00:00:32.309> free<00:00:32.580> do<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.720> with

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
welds are totally leak free do this with

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.340 
welds are totally leak free do this with
all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> engines<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.839> the<00:00:36.839> little<00:00:37.079> engine

all the engines and the little engine

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
all the engines and the little engine
like<00:00:37.470> this<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.860> run<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.210> few<00:00:39.449> little

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
like this can run for the few little

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.490 
like this can run for the few little
leaks<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.260> more<00:00:41.129> leaks<00:00:41.400> there<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.500> less

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
leaks but more leaks there are the less

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.430 
leaks but more leaks there are the less
it<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:44.239> run<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.550> throttle<00:00:47.550> will<00:00:47.699> be<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
it will run well and throttle will be a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
it will run well and throttle will be a
lot<00:00:49.440> worse<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:50.420> you're<00:00:51.420> gonna<00:00:51.510> ever<00:00:51.719> run<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> on

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
lot worse if you're gonna ever run it on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I'm going to be using a torch and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.370 
I'm going to be using a torch and
lighting<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.340> intake<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.110> blowing<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.200> little

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
lighting the intake and blowing a little

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990 
lighting the intake and blowing a little
bit<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.560> compressed<00:01:58.950> air<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.340> inside<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
bit of compressed air down inside of it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.469 
bit of compressed air down inside of it
and<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:01.830> was<00:02:01.979> also<00:02:02.610> started<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.270> pretty

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and that was also started up pretty

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.870 
and that was also started up pretty
easily<00:02:03.690> right<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.069> about<00:02:05.190> ten<00:02:05.520> degrees

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
easily right now it's about ten degrees

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.840 
easily right now it's about ten degrees
out<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.330> it's<00:02:06.630> absolutely<00:02:07.229> bitter<00:02:07.770> cold<00:02:08.100> so

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
out and it's absolutely bitter cold so

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.850 
out and it's absolutely bitter cold so
what<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.030> doing<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.690> warming<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.709> this

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
what I'm doing is I'm warming up this

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.160 
what I'm doing is I'm warming up this
little<00:02:11.130> propane<00:02:11.580> tank<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.930> bit<00:02:13.049> of

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
warm water and that will help boost the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.630 
warm water and that will help boost the
propane<00:02:17.970> fuel<00:02:18.269> pressure

of compressed air in the intake and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.240 
of compressed air in the intake and
we'll<00:02:41.400> start<00:02:41.730> rumbling<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.070> making<00:02:44.070> some

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
we'll start rumbling and making some

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.900 
we'll start rumbling and making some
pops<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:44.640> bangs<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:46.430> don't<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.490> it's<00:02:47.640> pretty

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
pops of bangs I don't know it's pretty

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.490 
pops of bangs I don't know it's pretty
damn<00:02:48.060> cold<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.050> might<00:02:49.170> take<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> few

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
damn cold out so it might take a few

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.300 
damn cold out so it might take a few
seconds<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.100> start<00:02:50.370> up<00:02:50.550> but<00:02:51.240> once<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> gets

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
seconds to start up but once it gets

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
seconds to start up but once it gets
roaring<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:54.180> I'm<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.600> going<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.780> increase

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
roaring and I'm just going to increase

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.699 
roaring and I'm just going to increase
the<00:02:55.470> fuel<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.740> little<00:02:56.040> bit<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.620> take<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the fuel a little bit and take the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.290 
the fuel a little bit and take the
compressed<00:02:58.980> air<00:02:59.250> away<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.850> should<00:03:00.150> keep

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
compressed air away and it should keep

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.650 
compressed air away and it should keep
on<00:03:00.510> going<00:03:00.810> then<00:03:01.940> after<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.060> warmed<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.510> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
on going then after it's warmed up you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.030 
on going then after it's warmed up you
can<00:03:04.010> crank<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.160> up<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.400> full<00:03:05.550> throttle
