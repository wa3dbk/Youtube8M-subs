00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 all we want too and how to checkmate everyone 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello there are times when it is necessary 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.700
 create bootable USB flash drive with 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 windows operating system 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 and at hand only a magician, let's say from me 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.960
 such an incident happened just recently 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.760
 A friend brought me a computer is necessary 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 had to pause windu 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.260
 I have no Windows at the moment, but how 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.050
 do not create bootable flash drive 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 if I only have a magician here on the Internet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 there are many ways someone creates 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 through the terminal someone through special 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 programs that also have in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 I offer the easiest Internet 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 the way 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.930
 I installed windows 10 operating system 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.040
 that is, I went to the microsoft site 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.629
 election here punks download iso image 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.610
 here is the data from the operating image 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.950
 system windows 10 the fact that I 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 asked to put windows 10 in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.020
 as a demonstration on a netbook 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.489
 well before selling it because 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.460
 license system sell no 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.440
 wanted with this netbook and so i downloaded 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.280
 this windows operating system image 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.590
 10 here I have it is this iso-image 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 you can download your own 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.659
 whichever you put 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.000
 windows 7 windows 8 or windows 10 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.619
 keep in mind that the way i am 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.820
 show it is good if you have 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.280
 windows 64 operating system 32 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.619
 32 bit windows operating system 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 you don't work like that right you can't 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 by this method create a bootable 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 flash drive 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.140
 me on the desktop and the eternal flash drive 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.329
 8 gigs and the first thing is not necessary 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 experience prepare i go disk 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.460
 I select my flash drive utility 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.729
 undress split into split 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:53.020
 here I indicate here m with dos fat I press 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.700
 apply and split into several sections 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.950
 seconds we need to wait for now 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 mac operating system format 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.680
 our flash drive order then i run 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.700
 a utility called ost and boot 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.430
 camp click continue to clean these 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.170
 checkboxes they are not not needed i choose only 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.640
 create an installation check mark 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.360
 drive windows 7 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.970
 Well, either a USB flash drive I press 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.980
 continue 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.600
 I indicate where I posted the iso image 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.890
 windows operating system 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.900
 in this case, this iso image of windows 10 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.190
 64-bit which weighs a little more than 4 geeks 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.450
 automatically my flash drive is detected 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.540
 system mac use flash drive media 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.120
 click continue 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.690
 yes yes flash drive will be all the data I lose 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.790
 i press continue with my 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 screen flashes past the flash drive 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.310
 then appears again 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.750
 the process of formatting it and we are now 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.260
 see what is written on the screen what is 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.910
 data is copied this process is approximately 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.670
 it takes me but in this case 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.519
 took literally about 25 minutes to start 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.500
 sit down at the speed of your flash drive after 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.329
 complete and supply all data 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.060
 will copy you will be completely 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.820
 bootable flash drive and successful with 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.920
 windows operating system you can 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.930
 put the Windows let's say parallel to 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.019
 your 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.269
 hackintosh if you want but either you 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.909
 you can just put Windows on another 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.590
 a computer like this 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.349
 create bootable USB flash drive with 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.650
 windows operating system 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.109
 mac i don't know will this method work 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.829
 if you have a chameleon uploader 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.930
 the whole thing is that ass and 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.389
 boot camp it only works perfectly in 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.280
 system carpet and this means the bootloader 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.829
 you on your hakkin should also be 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.650
 only the carpet I will not write it all 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.419
 video now click on pause year after 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.700
 complete i turn on the video again we 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.700
 let's see that the process is complete 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.629
 creation is complete as we see that 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.950
 the inscription that the file disk drives successfully 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.600
 copied onto a flash drive we all complete 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.759
 take out your funny flash drive and can 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:26.080
 install Windows on any beekeeper 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:29.199
 computers windows setup ok 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.690
 is the boot flash drive working like this 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.639
 way you can system mac quietly through 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.930
 program to create booths boot 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.910
 USB flash drive 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.650
 I think that all the same to someone is 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.320
 useful who wants to put say 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.750
 Windows on your computer or another 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.000
 computer and he needs to do 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
 bootable USB flash drive if not at hand 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.650
 Windows so no problem in 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.490
 make a bootable USB flash drive for 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.060
 windows 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.460
 here but at the moment I set on 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.080
 netbook windows 10 operating system 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.080
 for demonstration 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.740
 but here's what you see. 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.349
 the method works perfectly without playing 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.930
 any problems i fixed 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.990
 windows 10 operating system on this 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.070
 on netbook as a demonstration by 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.580
 this method 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.250
 so who is interested remember 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:25.110
 you can try it yourself everyone thanks
