 I'll show you, despite the rain, we know what's up for "Iron Mike" 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.889
 everything is for the guest 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.470
 So the team itself in the version as the actual goal 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.610
 so now is first know which sport that is and choose to go 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.610
 says author was 1 5 5 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.390
 and the properties themselves and just open the gates 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:29.890
 Polzer 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.150
 Netzer was there 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.690
 2 5 5 6 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 a lady with that the region 10 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.980
 we went now to Rome's Duygu consumption Shalit a Fritz box with each rout 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.910
 is that different 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.020
 and i cant help you for example in the Netgear or otherwise 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.580
 What 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.800
 that is with somebody how can i not help there 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.310
 you just have to google 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.230
 and then 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 the idea with the Fritz box 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.480
 including the director 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.020
 Of course, one aliens will be reported 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.310
 June Nina Aigner has to have some power 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.530
 respectively 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.670
 promptly set up the router 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 and that also has the passport of Wilson and Tom Slagter problem 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.560
 because they were under the bed Internet Diddy or releases 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.710
 and civil defense are not set up port shares 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280
 because they gave the new sperm whale 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 the new incident Gaber 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.080
 now you go to other applications or directly to CC Palin 5 if that's yours 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.830
 in Minden 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.270
 until the summer at the Fritzbox so among other things on the Internet such as brings 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.340
 represent 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.830
 then offer the advantage that we had claimed to lift these days copied 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.690
 to have 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.220
 which held the hands 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.050
 and 4 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.480
 which allows selection for which it is automatic during world 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.780
 Taxes carry them out with what he can do 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.939
 to let the wine house 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.739
 if you still give the name here especially game 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.479
 at his option 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
 but my character is my character 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.319
 and then it gets to approx 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.849
 sign up now 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.400
 CCP released we need thinking for my body yet 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.819
 very close up 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.870
 Another highlight was her 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.849
 lost again 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.009
 June also BMW p 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 Kicker Mr. Mack Depreciation 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.339
 were asked 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.969
 after now 1 was 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.939
 because I do not know if 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.649
 maybe change 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.759
 more than good 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.529
 and Baumann 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.529
 the answer 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.579
 we can enter the PC again 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:02.590
 «For the guest is 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.839
 under the belly Prophet 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:07.779
 Sulzer this 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.819
 in the 4 2 against the CCP and vice versa 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.559
 that is very well prepared and wanted 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.559
 and now you can open your friends 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.979
 Miss Mike creates projects for himself, of course, if he does otherwise 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:24.989
 and 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.969
 yes, but the clip for the 12 joy still wanted the pep comes on vacation 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:30.959
 go 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.079
 Savings project internet browser 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.079
 if one closes a child he could become 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 and then you are like yours 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.379
 then lived your friends and they can turn on a server 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.359
 takes care 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.879
 only extended 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.029
 what did we do something it brought a light that we released the pot 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:51.819
 to have 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.989
 we have a certain amount of silent is quasi PCs 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.669
 for the network 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.819
 released HB 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.279
 but she announced the case but advise 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.749
 only on this one single server 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.099
 So be part of the team 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.719
 so that she is the halt 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.839
 2 5 5 6 4 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.839
 That's why you call that 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.120
 So Euro of Claassen I can access him gained data but they remain 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.870
 and 49 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.300
 No my body was 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.680
 and in the next qualifying session today we stood with 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.539
 and internet is not a provider 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.520
 his website 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.719
 as you with it 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.270
 a solid eichi get because if now their then one reads einfiel 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.240
 befriend this address 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.420
 and the day after 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.490
 Prof Polak want 2 percent to twelve liters 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.139
 Müller and Horst 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.909
 that's because that 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.059
 For the time being it will be with this message 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.469
 the PC every day a different Radtke that is Yakin does not stay that way 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.129
 They just want to change every day 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.979
 That's why I want you in the next foil 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.479
 show her like you 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.610

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.729
