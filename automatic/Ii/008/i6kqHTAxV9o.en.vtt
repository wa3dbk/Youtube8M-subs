00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.400
 hi girls and guys this time I bring you 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.650
 a makeup for encacarados eyes this 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.039
 it's a different technique than video 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.289
 previous I did on this same topic 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.980
 it is more or less an eyelid surgery 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.240
 without surgery I hope you like such 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.390
 see here in the photo 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.949
 my model has the eyes encapotados well 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 that if they want to see the technique follow 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:34.320
 watching the video 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.590
 [Music] 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.140
 she is my patricia friend and for her 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.350
 It's always a pleasure to have her here in my 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 good study we kill laughing 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.260
 We have previously hydrated the skin of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 pati with this in berlin and we have also 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 disguised the pores with this look 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.750
 by face I did not ask patti to come 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 to my studio to make this video since 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.519
 she has the eyelids encapotados and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.490
 I think it may work perfect for 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.680
 teach them this new technique 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.470
 let's start with the eyes placing this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 mccain order software with this brush 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.730
 you can use your fingers if 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.710
 they like is important patricia has 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.850
 these clefts in the eyes in the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.010
 commissures here we're going to emphasize I'm going 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.320
 to also place a shadow called 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.190
 blue lake with this brand brush 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.200
 glock around the eyelid but 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.090
 emphasizing right here in these 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.260
 slits to give them a little bit more 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.239
 light 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.239
 [Music] 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 how can you see the cracks 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.870
 they have practically disappeared with only 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.000
 put this shadow lighter now I'm going to 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.920
 place a shadow a bit metallic 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.159
 that is called room that is of marc with 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.320
 this broach 239 and we're going to start it 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.810
 to put on the mobile eyelid starting 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
 from the base of the eyelashes and we're going 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.070
 rising by a few 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.170
 we want to go up a few millimeters more 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.540
 up that this fold that she has 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.200
 that is what we cloak the eyelid 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.250
 to climb about 5 to 6 millimeters higher 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.780
 of that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.840
 [Music] 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.390
 ready and now let's take is 217 with 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.730
 this mac shadow in the color cut is 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.300
 a very light brown and we are going to create 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.520
 a shadow a slight shadow exactly 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.520
 there 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.530
 as giving the impression that it is a 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.810
 true concave but it 's only the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.240
 now we are going to place a color 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.650
 of brown a little darker 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.600
 this is the express color of Mar 12 17 and 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.790
 let's start by emphasizing the greatest 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.450
 amount of color here in the part 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.760
 external left of the eye as in one of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.950
 horizontal and what's left on the brush 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.460
 we are going to upload it a few 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.230
 in this false concave that we have created 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.620
 now I'm going to take this darker shadow 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.890
 in amber with a brush type 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.280
 brush and what we want is 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.890
 make a very thin stripe because what 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.050
 what we want is to push this area towards 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 back to make it look like there's a 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:22.919
 concave that there is a depth 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.919
 [Music] 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.590
 then we are going to join that concave doing 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.500
 an internal line and we blur it with 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.500
 about 217 as you are seeing it 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.040
 now I'm going to take this shadow again 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.000
 zoom and with the same brush I will 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.400
 mark well those 45 millimeters that we have 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.010
 uploaded because it 's just important that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.440
 be well marked that you want it to be 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.410
 well clear and well lit 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.930
 now I'm going to take this black pencil in 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.840
 world club of the brand depend and keith on 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.240
 color progression and I'm going to mark the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.640
 eyelashes I do not want to do an outline 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.920
 because this would shrink the eyelid what 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.380
 I want the eye to look outlined 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.500
 therefore we are delineating what by 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.390
 inside we are going to do the same in the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.170
 lower part of the eyes we are going to delineate 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.170
 inside 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.480
 and now taking this mac shadow 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.180
 expressed again and it's the same 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.240
 brochette type brush let's delineate 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.129
 the eyes at the bottom 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.589
 [Music] 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.709
 now I'm going to take this black shadow with 

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:44.899
 the same pencil type brush and I'm going to 

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.149
 delineate the eyes but only in the part 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:50.389
 lower eye but in this part 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:52.849
 external nothing more to give more strength to 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.569
 the outer part of the eye we use 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.569
 tabs 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.440
 and now I'm going to place this more expensive 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.280
 the ethical brand in strengthening 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.440
 continuous that has become my favorite and 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.840
 now I'm going to put false eyelashes 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.419
 [Music] 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.360
 and now I'm going to take this l'orÃ©al magic 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.460
 club and council is a drunken 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.370
 truth and I'm going to put it down here 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.080
 the eyebrows to illuminate this area what 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.330
 let's blend well with your fingers 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.819
 so that that area under the eyebrows 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.230
 well lit and there is a contrast between 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:32.729
 the con with false and the eyebrow bone 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.800

 especially in the external part this 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.569
 tail here because for you you have the 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.610
 Very nice eyebrows very well shaved in 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.880
