00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.440
 we started the magazine's 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.090
 today talking about the crisis in the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.820
 poultry farming 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.880
 there motors claim the reduction of the gain 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.400
 on broiler fattening is the result of 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.850
 high in the cost of the feed that feed 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.900
 poultry with the price of corn sack 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 costing 18 reais in 2010 to 30 in 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.290
 February of 2013 and soy from 28 to 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.180
 60 in the same period 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.180
 you can evaluate that the basic elements 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.300
 for rations of poultry rose significantly 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.610
 unbridled 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.100
 on the other hand, the price of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.899
 chicken remained stable 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.500
 To give you an idea, Brazil exported 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:00.039
 in 2011, 6 million and 400 million 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.079
 dollars with 3 million and 400,000 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.899
 tons of slaughtered birds 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.149
 from January to November 2012 to 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.759
 amount of meat was the same 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.330
 but there was a 5% decrease in value 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.390
 paid for export 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.750
 so many designers are leaving 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.790
 the activity the independents for example 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.369
 that do not work together with 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.549
 slaughterhouses practically do not exist 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.439
 plus those working in the system 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.259
 consortium adds up to the 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.270
 year on year and remains for now in 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.329
 activity to maintain a tradition of 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.180
 familiar as is the case of aldo fregonesi 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.159
 Company Website 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.420
 a tradition that we have the trip 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.970
 they are on the farm and they closed they will 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.579
 deteriorate much faster 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.590
 the theft problem then we'll come 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.540
 Trying to play has the most 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.149
 old that we want to keep in 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.340
 activity but if there is no other way 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.020
 as we have already left other 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
 activities in the milk case that we 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.399
 we produced the idea of ​​a liter of milk 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.729
 Let's stop because of injury to 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.890
 maintain an ideal environment in this aviary 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.730
 with 24 thousand birds 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.000
 the poultry farmer spends in the summer 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.370
 electricity in winter this goes up 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.489
 to five thousand reais 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.900
 wood heating last year with 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.870
 17 lots 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.459
 the owner of this aviary had a loss of 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.610
 20 thousand reais 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.819
 the situation of the integrated poultry farmer I 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.489
 that remains for us today here she is 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:44.110
 very difficult it does not cover the costs 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:47.049
 that you notified us is not part of 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 producer does not cover the costs difficulty 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.319
 to receive from the companies that integrate 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.079
 with us and always lower price than 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.290
 we spend no batch of agent 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.140
 received 80% of what we spent at 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.959
 times on track after he loaded chicken 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.049
 the very great difficulty in the average of 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.299
 a loss of 20 thousand reais but 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.049
 We had a lot that protects the expected 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.090
 arrived in a lot of 45 50 days of giving 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.129
 12 thousand reais of injury is also 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.109
 very concerned about this situation. 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.390
 besides that I said that the 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.870
 people received less than 80% of us 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.750
 We had expenses and it was to receive or 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.599
 stayed to receive 100 days after the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.669
 This 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.230
 that the government needs to evaluate 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.940
 the incentive for farmers to 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.400
 Brazilians 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.790
 already from the transport of the grains to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.209
 and accounts for 75% of the cost of 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.239
 production states and the producing 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.780
 far from concentrated poultry in the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.530
 in the south and southeast of the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.099
 parents 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.690
 In summary, the producer has no 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.970
 will come up with a solution to enable 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.079
 Your business depends on factors 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.870
 external 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.519
 part of these factors is the contribution 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.150
 government agencies in the sense of 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.650
 facilitate logistical disposal of this 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.769
 facilitate the tax issue also 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.730
 which should reduce taxes in a 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.919
 significant and on the other hand 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.840
 encourage the consumption and export of 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.729
 product because then it is a law of 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.710
 market demand and supply law 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.550
 if I have more naturally seek the 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.550
 price will rise
