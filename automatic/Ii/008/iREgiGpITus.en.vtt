00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 hey people here is the kelvin and in 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.180
 This movie I want you again 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.040
 what to recommend 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 and this time it's about one 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 backpack I always get there 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 e-mails again and ask something like one 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 backpack because I use and what the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.859
 Backpack I can recommend 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.810
 somehow I already have those 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.300
 ass card because no matter what I recommend 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.890
 he will come back and be named eighth 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.890
 Calvin just makes it because he loves her 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.689
 gets paid and so on 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.599
 is it working with partners 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 then of course you get discounts 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 or something sponsored here and there 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.550
 and of course you also talk 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.710
 positive 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 but how does it come to one? 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 co-operation comes to a cooperation 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.980
 In my case, only when I am 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 I think something is good and I want it too 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 Do not talk about it in this movie 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.010
 and somehow fool you into something 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.670
 not true fact I was on the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 photokina and then I'm on a company 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.789
 I called the stop f stop 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.170
 always thought so f stop app store badisch 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.960
 Such a blog in memory but that was 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.530
 then something else top gear point 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 com 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 and I 've got this on 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.369
 looked at next day and then I'm on 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.869
 came to a stand where very many 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.640
 Backpacks are offered 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 and i have backpacks suitable for you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 Wanted to be quite satisfied 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.799
 not necessarily because of the quality 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.600
 but because of the size because of 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.150
 division of subjects and so on and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 I have then on site just like that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.040
 show a few backpacks and I am 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 stuck with a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.680
 multi pack in the himself and he costs 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 100 euro instead of 108 euro and the backpack 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.119
 the user already a while and now 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.810
 I told the boys I take that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.430
 backpack now and if he is good then 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 I would still velen clearly I do 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.880
 with everything that I like when something works 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.470
 is bad and with shit to say 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.509
 then I recommend it not unmentioned 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.159
 Neither am I now none of them 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.780
 I also have such backpacks 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.040
 not so many backpacks to choose from 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.320
 they compared with each other 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.340
 it draws you in there magazines 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 something is tested again and again 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.399
 but I just want mine 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.570
 give feedback 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.369
 what a backpack I have to have 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.680
 yes, a buy it can not matter 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.599
 because I have none of it 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.360
 I'll tell you why I use it 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.950
 why I like him and we like him 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.870
 look ok and then just decide 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.610
 even I have no code and it 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.099
 There is no discount for me or 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.910
 Anything else but it's pure 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.640
 a recommendation 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.970
 So that was the backpack for me 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.290
 important that my laptop goes in because 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.090
 I'm traveling a lot with you 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.980
 laptop and that my camera goes in there 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.900
 was the most important thing and me 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.720
 wanted a backpack as small as possible 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.110
 types and the backpack became then 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.209
 I think loud information is in 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.310
 rucksack in 17 inch laptop pure 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.290
 I was yet again on this video 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.380
 and pdf attached or something where 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.299
 few technical data are 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.069
 i have 15 inch macbook and fits now 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.480
 super here in the back and there is 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.500
 of course several more subjects such as 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.819
 example here in front 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.010
 Of course you can do that yourself 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.660
 somehow stuck together in which 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.579
 form always one wants to have 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.530
 I still have an objective and please 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.840
 small witnesses couple cables i take with me 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.850
 must and my camera of course fits 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 purely up here always come my whole 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.680
 adapter rows that I always take with me 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.450
 my seminars are louder 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.160
 different adapters and what has 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.730
 this subject is especially cool here 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.310
 above 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.889
 I already had a jacket in it 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.569
 I already have my purse 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.980
 had everything in it 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.269
 we are very big fold and i find 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.609
 very cool so last so these three 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.130
 main subjects here right then here 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.590
 above but a bit deeper and 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.329
 then just this subject for the laptop 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.329
 There is still such a small front here 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.519
 pocket where you know what to pack 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.920
 I find this bag very small 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.810
 've got a few additional adapters 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.540
 the cut in need the charger 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.130
 etc and on the side, there are times 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.139
 I usually have my little subjects 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.549
 headphones in it and is now in there too 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:07.060
 this road there is a backpack 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.650
 I do not have that many fishermen now 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.410
 would say reduced to the essential 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.130
 he is comfortable and it was personal to me 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.930
 important so I've also seen 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.630
 I want him first a few weeks 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.310
 carry and use land and I use 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.150
 he's been around for a few weeks now 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.590
 Comfort is not important is relative 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.570
 small 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.910
 I think and that's why I recommend 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.680
 to them as I said I will one again 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.570
 small data sheet dranhÃ¤ngen I 'll 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.700
 times the website running where he the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.490
 you can look at it best 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.140
 Just take a look yourself and get involved 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.730
 own picture of it 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.950
 I am not one of this video as a test 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.710
 video looks for backpacks around then 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.260
 many rucksacks 1 to recommend but 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.820
 I use it so I like it 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.170
 I totally recommend them no matter if I am 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.420
 I now get paid or 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.050
 paid that does not play at all 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.240
 role 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.040
 and now decide for yourself whether 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.330
 the backpack for you maybe 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.470
 are some of them already 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.950
 have backpack or maybe just 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.350
 have the same and so it looks like me 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.580
 I am satisfied with and will say in 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.580
 this sense until the next video
