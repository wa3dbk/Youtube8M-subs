00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 that is all here is life known with the results 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.010
 of this race you are smooth and in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.429
 next videos that everyone recorded today 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.450
 it will be smooth today is Sunday and I am 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.280
 since I am well taken with this 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 thesis matter I have to finish it within 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 a certain amount of time 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 I decided that he saw only he had holdings 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.640
 Sunday or Saturday and then the montero 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.859
 during the week in the evening and there 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.060
 therefore they charge today that they are the usual ones 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.030
 three or four five videos and I will mount 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 these in the coming weeks e 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.110
 so you will see says even though I between two 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.850
 days are no longer so also 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 I do not know a little bit cloudy Khatami 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.129
 if you see among other things today there is a sun 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.300
 bestial a sign they are 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 accustomed and therefore I do not know if you will see well 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 if the light too much if too little 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 not us I'm worried too that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.219
 they say the truth we leave immediately with 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.480
 the results of the mancha and I will stop 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.550
 touch your hair 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 then this race went very well 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 great for really all the teams 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.949
 extraordinary thing because really 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.119
 extraordinary 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.430
 there is no team in the person 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.990
 entity we are made a team that is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 kept a bit low but still lost 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.900
 something 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.729
 all the others above half a kilo 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.780
 so fantastic of average head 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.009
 obviously 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 we leave immediately as andy cole 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.320
 fifteenth that are the cassatelle that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 they lost 0.13 then two pounds a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 little girl with a medium party 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.189
 and oh well it will be better next time 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.650
 that the cassatelle then there are the 14th 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.570
 place the gianduiotti that go up immediately 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.270
 at 0.61 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.329
 so the friselle are very good at the 13th 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.880
 placed at 0.74 of average head then 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:50.610
 twelfth the briefest 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.729
 pagnottelle 0.8 brave eleventh place 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.670
 Adriatic 0.86 therefore practically a 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.820
 kilo tosco liguri tenth place 0.91 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 immediately above the sfogliatelle ninth place 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.980
 0 that owed 94 to a whisper the cradled 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 l0 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.400
 after place 0.80 no 96 I ask carmi a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.250
 right to average the policies a kilo 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.880
 Exactly average head lost then 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.410
 very good and here all these six 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.840
 so rho teams lost then 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.950
 more than a kilo some even almost 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.720
 almost two kilos each so then the 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.180
 sixth place of the Venetian friuli 1,13 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.570
 therefore very good in fifth place e 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 ciccia sto 1.43 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.320
 bravissime then we are together to 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.690
 Sardinian girls and therefore all good at 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.700
 fourth place the cutlets equal merit 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.070
 with the Basilicata calabria 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.360
 I was still saying campaign is there from 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.190
 say something about the Basilicata campania 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.350
 only one girl participated 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.480
 lost 1.5 so I placed it at 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.220
 third place equal with the cutlets 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.110
 third place, in short, equal merit 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.150
 third place and nothing about her good sex 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.660
 now we'll see if we can fix it 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.920
 regards the others and others very good 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.410
 the cutlets which in reality it is instead 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.130
 they were many and participated and have 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.720
 lost on average 1.5 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.239
 second place my team giggles 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.709
 we lost 1.8 kilograms per head 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.470
 average we are very good and only 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.010
 happy girls and the first place of 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 rome who lost 1.99 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.560
 no 129 so practically two kilos yes 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.420
 deserve the podium let's see between 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.030
 I think the girls of Rome that won 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.550
 who only participated in four 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.720
 exact then francesca had gods 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.030
 problems with the scale because it has 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.250
 changed scales and is four 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.590
 extra pounds and okay 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.330
 in the sense it is a budget problem 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.440
 this is obvious I am sorry because he has you 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.390
 lowered the average but you still have 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.810
 won so I said ok, I consider it 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.170
 equally despite being doing the 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.870
 then there was a moraine who has 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.950
 lost two pounds and the two winners of 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.770
 this race because both of those 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 they lost more in both the team and 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:23.540
 towards all the others and they are 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.380
 first place marta who lost 4.9 kg e 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.880
 katia the aunt who now four roses and 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.890
 kg 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.240
 Exactly you were very good I do 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.560
 I congratulate you, I'll show you 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.590
 first chievo bought are like al 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:43.190
 usually of boilers of nonsense 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:45.169
 I swear I'll have to put the team who were here 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.550
 matinÃ©e I have never tried but me 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.380
 they looked like barrel they cost little and 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.510
 so i decided to take good ho 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.030
 took two colors maybe you could 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.470
 to use this, for example , I already have 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.850
 they preferred that to the green one 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.320
 I wanted to buy the real one 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.700
 I said ok by him he bought the king 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.040
 they will let me know how they are also because 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.240
 there were no tests, it is the one that must 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.070
 choose marta marta you send which one 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.650
 prefer the blue one the green one that is 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:15.950

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.520
 the other, of course, and here they are alone 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.770
 a little thought as usual but give me the 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.870
 two addresses and I I'll let receives 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:36.710
