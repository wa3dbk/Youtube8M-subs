 this mask of the purchase for the lathe 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 It is very beautiful because it is round 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.240

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.450
 I recommend it to stand out and also from 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.390
 last charge because they see that 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.330

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.750
 Compass your 12-inch compasses to 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.680
 the winch with tips for outside compass 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.510
 normal internal tips is very nice 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.640
 it's very good on the temple to make it 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.700
 so hard to get a real 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.440

 day of our lady of light or it 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.770
 two weeks ago and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.030
 Well, if they are going to the square with their 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.590
 family 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.829
 you have a little spin for being there 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.089
 some news this is the little table 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.649
 work 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.140
 I'm going to occupy it at home 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.320
 environment constructions 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 you can do it but I'm going 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.159
 seeing their wood with or without wood 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.969
 wood is graduated 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.969
 it's very good 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.310
 they already know the new clamps of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.200
 craftsman I'm going to show you 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.110
 I'm going to start with this one 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.259
 this is a point clamp as they can 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.259
 watch 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.500
 safe 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.500
 and in a little more 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.900
 but that the novelty have these clamps 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.870
 of tip that is the novelty 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.140
 are transformers let's see why it 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.880
 transforms 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.880
 I have a pair of cutting tongs 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.950
 magically they became 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.750
 cutting brushes and if I want to turn them 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.140
 to convert into a pincer tip 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.400
 I just have to do this 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.819
 I have a pair of tweezers good tip 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.819
 we are going to unveil 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.770
 the magic of this of this transformation 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.380
 cutting tweezers 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.840
 pincers 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.330
 here I have insurance in case I do not want and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.480
 also this game that they are going to hang 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.319
 the height of the waist 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.629
 I have some electrician tweezers 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.129
 they feel more or less later if clear it 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.560
 feels very good you feel more or less 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.019
 but what is the curious detail of these 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.019
 tweezers that are there 2 3 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.260
 that disarm 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 keep this 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.740
 and I have a pair of needle nose pliers 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.780
 I can get 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.099
 save this one wants to tighten a nut 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:41.240
 I have here some mechanic's clamps 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.080
 novelty 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.380
 they just brought this bank so that 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.840
 comes 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.430
 I loose the bank forum I put him 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.180
 obviously the jigsaw has it in 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.969
 English that is the same 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.060
 for any certain of the black field 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:00.189
 for another saw 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.500
 no extension is an economic boat 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:07.090
 and this is nice 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.840
 brings to the legs is they bend to 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.840
 can I save it 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.609
 have these sauces here 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.060
 to move it to load it has here these 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.040
 four jumps this from here 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.030
 that if we throw it 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.030
 we can not release 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.250
 the English sierra 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.250
 we leave them we put them 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.040
 and this is it, they told me that they brought 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.340
 few 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:49.290
 in fact it has two weeks that 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:52.290
 I bought it and it's already in the kursaal where 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.490
 it was me that was the cost was not known in 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.580
 this square 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.950
 this was the last hopefully now 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.620
 that you still have because it is 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.500
 well bring your stone here you can 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.970
 pour water in here so that it 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.360
 I shouted a bit the cut so we went up 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.330
 the stone is economical is out there 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.900
 the thousand pesos because it has rivers and 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.900
 forwards 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.260
 with few revolutions yorihiko breathes 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:29.060
 very slow but it's not good they are for 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.920
 the necessary this maybe is not 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.110
 Novelty already has some time and in the 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.180
 events are shown to you from these presses 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.930
 even with practices here we love 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.050
 several sizes this well this block wise 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.569
 filling of different thicknesses of drill 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.689
 for different fixed 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:54.830
 for spades of the number number 10 of 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:57.649
 number 12 of the number 6 6 8 10 and 12 is the 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.559
 width of the drill bits for the hole 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:03.990
 together with countersink and this small 

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:07.020
 bit of the time 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.020
 it's fine it's fine between 7 and 13 and it's 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.740
 he made reasonable 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.970
 with vale well with your allen key good 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.610
 so then I who showed them the 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.500
 What's new you say if they serve you 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.470
 they are functional if they like it if not 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.330
 they like 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.960
 you always have the last word 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:30.530
 you are always right 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.530
 I show you the teapots that I see
