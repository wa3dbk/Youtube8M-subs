okay<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:38.840> positive<00:02:39.440> five<00:02:39.910> card<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.240> like

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
okay so positive five card there's like

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110 
okay so positive five card there's like
I<00:02:41.660> might<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.020> little<00:02:42.140> sticker<00:02:42.940> we<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
I might be a little sticker we have a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.140 
I might be a little sticker we have a
paperclip<00:02:44.780> literally<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.980> help<00:02:46.340> us<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.850> here

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
paperclip literally to help us up here

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.030 
paperclip literally to help us up here
and<00:02:47.530> let's<00:02:48.530> small<00:02:49.460> little<00:02:49.670> sim<00:02:50.000> card<00:02:50.710> pop<00:02:51.710> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
and let's small little sim card pop the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.310 
and let's small little sim card pop the
new<00:02:52.250> one<00:02:52.490> in<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.510> looks<00:02:53.690> like<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.080> network

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
new one in so it looks like the network

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.780 
new one in so it looks like the network
as<00:02:54.800> connected<00:02:55.670> as<00:02:57.070> we<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.220> see<00:02:58.400> right<00:02:58.580> there

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
as connected as we can see right there

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.470 
as connected as we can see right there
so<00:02:59.270> we're<00:02:59.390> going<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.720> launch<00:03:00.020> project<00:03:01.010> Phi<00:03:01.480> you

going to take a look and see a little
more<00:03:41.990> about<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.440> network<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.100> what<00:03:43.250> bands

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
more about the network and what bands

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.660 
more about the network and what bands
were<00:03:43.730> using<00:03:44.150> we<00:03:44.750> see<00:03:45.050> its<00:03:45.260> LTE<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.340> fine

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
were using we see its LTE on the fine

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.920 
were using we see its LTE on the fine
network<00:03:48.070> let's<00:03:49.070> go<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.460> engineering<00:03:50.330> mode<00:03:50.630> and

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
network let's go to engineering mode and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.350 
network let's go to engineering mode and
see<00:03:51.230> what<00:03:51.470> bands<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.730> using<00:03:55.090> look<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.210> that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
see what bands it's using look at that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.840 
see what bands it's using look at that
all<00:03:56.540> bands<00:03:57.110> are<00:03:57.230> now<00:03:57.350> enabled<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:58.220> we<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.550> two

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
all bands are now enabled so we have two

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.590 
all bands are now enabled so we have two

on<00:04:06.350> here<00:04:06.560> also<00:04:06.740> we<00:04:07.190> could<00:04:07.640> also<00:04:07.790> check<00:04:08.530> what

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
on here also we could also check what

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.070 
on here also we could also check what
