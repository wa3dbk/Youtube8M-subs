00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.680 
it will burn out in that time probably
and<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:53.500> does<00:04:53.650> send<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.100> room<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:55.240> leaves<00:04:55.479> the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and it does send the room and leaves the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.400 
and it does send the room and leaves the
room<00:04:55.840> smelling<00:04:56.169> nice<00:04:56.350> for<00:04:56.620> quite<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:56.830> long<00:04:56.919> time

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
room smelling nice for quite a long time

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.170 
room smelling nice for quite a long time
but<00:04:59.410> it's<00:04:59.590> not<00:04:59.830> there<00:05:00.070> not<00:05:00.160> long<00:05:00.220> burners<00:05:00.910> or

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
but it's not there not long burners or

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.870 
but it's not there not long burners or
anything<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:02.650> like<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.340> personally

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
anything so I like that personally

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.150 
anything so I like that personally
because<00:05:04.030> I<00:05:04.419> have<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.200> worry<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.620> one's<00:05:05.950> going

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
because I have to worry that one's going

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.310 
because I have to worry that one's going
to<00:05:06.190> be<00:05:06.310> alike<00:05:06.550> I'm<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:06.970> bit<00:05:07.120> bit<00:05:07.840> weird<00:05:08.110> with

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
to be alike I'm a bit bit weird with

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.870 
to be alike I'm a bit bit weird with
candles<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:08.889> stuff<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.280> don't<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.580> leaving

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
candles and stuff I don't like leaving

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.870 
candles and stuff I don't like leaving
them<00:05:10.000> alone<00:05:10.090> so<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:11.680> same<00:05:11.889> incense<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.580> is

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
them alone so the same incense that is

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.719 
them alone so the same incense that is
less<00:05:13.030> likely<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.540> burn<00:05:13.720> out<00:05:13.930> but<00:05:14.290> whether<00:05:14.500> I<00:05:15.430> do

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
less likely to burn out but whether I do

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.000 
less likely to burn out but whether I do
not<00:05:16.000> leave<00:05:16.150> them<00:05:16.330> alone<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:16.870> that's<00:05:17.830> quite

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
not leave them alone so that's quite

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.100 
not leave them alone so that's quite
good<00:05:18.100> for<00:05:18.340> me<00:05:18.460> but<00:05:19.000> if<00:05:19.330> that's<00:05:19.660> not<00:05:19.930> what<00:05:20.050> you

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
good for me but if that's not what you

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.409 
good for me but if that's not what you
like<00:05:20.350> then<00:05:20.530> those<00:05:20.770> do<00:05:21.010> burn<00:05:21.250> quite<00:05:21.520> quick<00:05:21.760> this

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
like then those do burn quite quick this

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.900 
like then those do burn quite quick this
one's<00:05:22.630> an<00:05:22.960> hour<00:05:23.169> burning<00:05:23.590> now<00:05:24.070> slow<00:05:24.490> burners

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910
