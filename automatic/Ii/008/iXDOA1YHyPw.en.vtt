called<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> politics<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.399> Sol<00:00:56.760> Sol<00:00:57.270> politics

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
called the politics of Sol Sol politics

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
called the politics of Sol Sol politics
they<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.399> want<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.910> feel<00:01:00.149> uplifted<00:01:00.719> somehow

they do want to feel uplifted somehow
and<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.640> may<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.879> more<00:01:03.300> essential

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and I think that may be more essential

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
and I think that may be more essential
right<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.350> than<00:01:04.619> any<00:01:04.830> kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.280> new

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

looks to me as though it's going to run
about<00:01:29.030> 73<00:01:29.840> million<00:01:30.110> which<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:30.679> really<00:01:30.920> not

whether he can bring the country

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.320 
whether he can bring the country
together<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.950> these<00:01:58.070> circumstances<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:59.090> don't

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
together in these circumstances I don't

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.940 
together in these circumstances I don't
know<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.570> don't<00:01:59.810> know<00:01:59.930> whether<00:02:00.080> anybody<00:02:00.530> put<00:02:00.830> in

know I don't know whether anybody put in

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.590 
know I don't know whether anybody put in
any<00:02:01.070> circumstances<00:02:01.909> because<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.360> everything

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
any circumstances because of everything

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.020 
any circumstances because of everything
would<00:02:02.869> happen<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.280> that's<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.640> medias

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
would happen from so that's a medias

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.760 
would happen from so that's a medias
there<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.479> playing<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.049> judging<00:02:06.350> by<00:02:06.380> what<00:02:06.650> he

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
there is playing and judging by what he

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.430 
there is playing and judging by what he
said<00:02:07.009> he<00:02:07.130> certainly<00:02:07.460> recognizes<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.360> but<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
said he certainly recognizes it but the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.250 
said he certainly recognizes it but the
election<00:02:10.160> itself<00:02:10.580> i<00:02:10.819> think<00:02:11.090> has<00:02:11.270> not<00:02:11.569> been<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
election itself i think has not been a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.370 
election itself i think has not been a
healing<00:02:13.130> thing<00:02:13.510> maybe<00:02:14.510> he<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.900> turn<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.230> into

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
healing thing maybe he can turn it into

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.670 
healing thing maybe he can turn it into
one<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:16.180> course<00:02:17.180> Richard<00:02:18.020> Nixon<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.650> a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
one of course Richard Nixon is a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.840 
one of course Richard Nixon is a
plurality<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.060> majority<00:02:20.480> president

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
plurality and not a majority president

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.990 
plurality and not a majority president
however<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.959> seems<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.319> me<00:02:24.440> as<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.000> tremendous

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
however it seems to me as a tremendous

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.210 
however it seems to me as a tremendous
opportunity<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:27.410> he<00:02:27.560> Luck's<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
opportunity here and if he Luck's out a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.410 
opportunity here and if he Luck's out a
bit<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.989> handles<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.140> well<00:02:30.440> his<00:02:31.130> popularity

think<00:02:43.010> we're<00:02:43.190> probably<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.300> little<00:02:44.420> vague<00:02:44.810> as

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
think we're probably a little vague as

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.420 
think we're probably a little vague as
to<00:02:45.200> what<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.180> direction<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.350> maybe<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
to what that direction is and maybe the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.070 
to what that direction is and maybe the
country<00:02:49.730> yourself<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> little<00:02:50.660> bit<00:02:50.810> vague

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
country yourself is a little bit vague

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.170 
country yourself is a little bit vague
about<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.709> sander<00:02:52.250> suggested<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.970> may<00:02:53.120> be

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
about it but sander suggested it may be

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.150 
about it but sander suggested it may be
the<00:02:53.360> end<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.750> big<00:02:53.900> government<00:02:54.350> program<00:02:54.769> maybe

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
the end the big government program maybe

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.830 
the end the big government program maybe
we<00:02:55.340> need<00:02:55.549> just<00:02:55.790> some<00:02:56.000> new<00:02:56.269> equipment<00:02:56.420> new

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
we need just some new equipment new

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.949 
we need just some new equipment new
machinery<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.680> handle<00:02:58.010> some<00:02:58.160> old<00:02:58.340> programs

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
machinery to handle some old programs

but<00:03:00.760> Nixon<00:03:01.760> has<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> great<00:03:02.150> opportunity<00:03:02.450> here

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
but Nixon has a great opportunity here

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.410 
but Nixon has a great opportunity here
yet<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.950> know<00:03:04.100> every<00:03:04.519> president<00:03:05.060> has<00:03:05.120> this

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
yet you know every president has this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.170 
yet you know every president has this
period<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.930> grace<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.310> think<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> poet

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
period of grace what I think the poet

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.449 
period of grace what I think the poet
Wordsworth<00:03:08.750> has<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.320> willing<00:03:09.650> suspension<00:03:09.890> of

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
Wordsworth has the willing suspension of

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.400 
Wordsworth has the willing suspension of
disbelief<00:03:10.519> people<00:03:11.510> are<00:03:11.600> ready<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:12.109> believe

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
disbelief people are ready to believe

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.620 
disbelief people are ready to believe
anything<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.609> think<00:03:13.790> what<00:03:13.910> mr.<00:03:14.030> Nixon<00:03:14.480> has

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
anything and I think what mr. Nixon has

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.979 
anything and I think what mr. Nixon has
to<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:14.900> very<00:03:15.170> quickly<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.190> move<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:17.630> sudden

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
to do very quickly is to move to sudden

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.350 
to do very quickly is to move to sudden
the<00:03:18.079> Vietnam<00:03:18.530> War

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
because as long as this cancer continues

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.000 
because as long as this cancer continues
to<00:03:22.210> infect<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> body<00:03:23.050> politic<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.860> this

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the Nixon years will be not terribly

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.000 
the Nixon years will be not terribly
unlike<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.420> Eisenhower<00:03:57.990> years<00:03:58.440> though<00:03:58.890> of

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240

the advantage of being a great national

most popular president in our lifetime

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.780 
most popular president in our lifetime
probably<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.740> be<00:04:07.860> elected<00:04:08.220> again<00:04:08.460> if<00:04:08.670> they

were younger and healthier and they were
legal<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> would<00:04:13.110> guess<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.440> would<00:04:13.560> be

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
legal so I would guess it would be

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.460 
legal so I would guess it would be
something<00:04:14.160> like<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.730> not<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.570> time<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.230> great

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
something like that not a time of great

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.150 
something like that not a time of great
social<00:04:16.890> turmoil<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.590> legislative<00:04:19.590> turmoil

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
social turmoil and a legislative turmoil

innovation new ideas I suspect with seen
very<00:04:23.430> few<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:24.240> maybe<00:04:24.270> some<00:04:24.720> maybe<00:04:25.440> some

very few and maybe some maybe some
attention<00:04:26.700> at<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.910> moment<00:04:26.940> David<00:04:27.930> there<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.290> a

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
somewhat uncomfortable point that I

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.980 
somewhat uncomfortable point that I

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
think has to be made which is that the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.690 
think has to be made which is that the
Nixon<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.110> not<00:04:34.260> entirely<00:04:34.620> trusted<00:04:35.250> by<00:04:35.460> large

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
Nixon is not entirely trusted by large

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.670 
Nixon is not entirely trusted by large
segments<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.480> American<00:04:36.900> population<00:04:37.080> of
