00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.420 
somehow I managed to dump about half
the<00:02:18.430> milk<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:19.090> my<00:02:19.269> bowl<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.019> my<00:02:20.170> bed<00:02:20.349> so<00:02:21.250> now

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
the milk for my bowl on to my bed so now

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.479 
the milk for my bowl on to my bed so now
I<00:02:21.459> get<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.790> lay<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.269> one<00:02:22.480> side<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.720> my<00:02:22.900> bed<00:02:23.050> and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
I get to lay on one side of my bed and

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.160 
I get to lay on one side of my bed and
wait<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.670> whole<00:02:24.849> night<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.510> shit<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.810> dry

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
wait the whole night for the shit to dry

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.170 
wait the whole night for the shit to dry
and<00:02:26.470> then<00:02:26.530> I'll<00:02:27.160> most<00:02:27.370> likely<00:02:27.489> smell<00:02:28.000> like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
and then I'll most likely smell like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.119 
and then I'll most likely smell like
milk<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.720> morning<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.560> should<00:02:30.010> be

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
milk in the morning so that should be

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.130

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.120 
interesting
I'm<00:04:21.360> sure<00:04:21.840> we'll<00:04:22.050> win<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.470> game<00:04:22.740> just

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
I'm sure we'll win this game just

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.910 
I'm sure we'll win this game just
because<00:04:23.310> we're<00:04:23.730> so<00:04:24.290> early<00:04:25.290> in<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.440> playoffs

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
because we're so early in the playoffs

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.260 
because we're so early in the playoffs
and<00:04:26.130> there's<00:04:26.250> not<00:04:26.490> really<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.880> much

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
and there's not really that much

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.680 
and there's not really that much
competition<00:04:27.900> yet<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.620> our<00:04:28.740> bracket<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.940> once

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
competition yet in our bracket so once

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.540 
competition yet in our bracket so once
it<00:04:30.870> gets<00:04:31.080> further<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.770> obviously<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.490> will

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
it gets further on it obviously it will

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.580 
it gets further on it obviously it will
it<00:04:32.670> be<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> lot<00:04:33.120> more<00:04:33.150> intense<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:34.290> I'm<00:04:34.410> sure

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
it be a lot more intense and I'm sure

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.360 
it be a lot more intense and I'm sure
even<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.890> MW<00:04:35.460> two<00:04:35.670> snd<00:04:36.630> lovers<00:04:37.260> my<00:04:37.950> level<00:04:38.340> a

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
even you MW two snd lovers my level a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.280 
even you MW two snd lovers my level a
little<00:04:38.610> bit<00:04:38.760> of<00:04:38.910> black<00:04:39.240> ops<00:04:39.480> playoff<00:04:40.020> action

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
little bit of black ops playoff action

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.410 
little bit of black ops playoff action
especially<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:41.100> it's<00:04:41.250> really<00:04:41.610> intense<00:04:41.940> so

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.300 

i'll<00:04:45.420> probably<00:04:45.810> post<00:04:46.170> some<00:04:46.470> of<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.800> when<00:04:47.160> it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
i'll probably post some of that when it

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.700 
i'll probably post some of that when it
comes<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:48.210> right<00:04:48.780> now<00:04:48.840> it's<00:04:49.260> just<00:04:49.440> pretty

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
that know the password so nothing really

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.360 
that know the password so nothing really
happens<00:05:14.880> like<00:05:15.150> i<00:05:15.420> don't<00:05:16.020> know<00:05:16.140> i'm<00:05:16.440> not<00:05:16.650> saying
