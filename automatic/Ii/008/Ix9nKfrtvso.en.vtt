won't do very well but they also won't
do<00:01:59.140> poorly<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.710> pass<00:02:00.040> away<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:02.110> when<00:02:02.770> things

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
do poorly and pass away so when things

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.590 
do poorly and pass away so when things
get<00:02:03.340> interesting<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.300> when<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.540> start

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
get interesting is when you start

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.270 
get interesting is when you start
pushing<00:02:05.140> your<00:02:05.290> sims<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.710> achieve<00:02:06.010> something

that's when you need to worry about
their<00:02:08.020> needs<00:02:08.230> so<00:02:08.350> if<00:02:08.590> you're<00:02:08.770> say<00:02:09.340> you're

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
their needs so if you're say you're

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.250 
their needs so if you're say you're
pushing<00:02:10.030> them<00:02:10.150> really<00:02:10.420> hard<00:02:10.600> at<00:02:10.720> work<00:02:10.869> because

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
pushing them really hard at work because

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.960 
pushing them really hard at work because
you<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.560> get<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.710> promotion<00:02:11.920> will<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.820> be

you want to get a promotion will it be
pretty<00:02:13.150> exhausted<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.110> need<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
pretty exhausted so then you need to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.050 
pretty exhausted so then you need to
worry<00:02:14.650> about<00:02:14.800> taking<00:02:15.190> care<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.580> them<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.910> that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060

with you you can create them and they'll

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.070 
with you you can create them and they'll
look<00:03:21.760> you'll<00:03:22.420> be<00:03:22.570> able<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.780> make<00:03:22.870> them<00:03:23.050> look

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
look you'll be able to make them look

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.630 
look you'll be able to make them look
like<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.530> people<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.040> know<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.489> then

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
like the people that you know and then

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.100 
like the people that you know and then
they'll<00:03:24.790> actually<00:03:24.970> behave<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.959> real

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
they'll actually behave like the real

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.330 
they'll actually behave like the real
people

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.150 

I<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.140> premise<00:03:36.890> of<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.129> game

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
I think that the the premise of the game

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.110 
I think that the the premise of the game
is<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.680> have<00:03:39.980> control<00:03:40.400> over<00:03:40.459> life<00:03:40.879> and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
is that you have control over life and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.199 
is that you have control over life and
so<00:03:42.050> everything<00:03:42.440> we<00:03:42.709> do<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.760> future<00:03:44.000> is

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
so everything we do in the future is

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.420 
so everything we do in the future is
going<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.569> be<00:03:44.720> about<00:03:44.840> giving<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.440> more

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
going to be about giving you more

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.500 
going to be about giving you more
territory<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.300> explore<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.580> more<00:03:49.580> freedom<00:03:50.000> to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
territory to explore and more freedom to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.380 
territory to explore and more freedom to
do<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:52.190> think<00:03:52.670> in<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:52.940> future<00:03:52.970> you'll

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
do that so I think in the future you'll

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.479 
do that so I think in the future you'll
just<00:03:53.599> see<00:03:53.780> us<00:03:53.810> kind<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.410> pushing<00:03:54.830> pushing<00:03:55.250> the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
just see us kind of pushing pushing the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.539 
just see us kind of pushing pushing the
edges<00:03:55.819> of<00:03:55.849> what<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.390> sims<00:03:56.599> can<00:03:56.900> do<00:03:57.549> giving

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
edges of what the sims can do giving

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.300 
edges of what the sims can do giving
them<00:03:58.670> more<00:03:58.849> places<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.330> go<00:04:00.160> giving<00:04:01.160> them

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
them more places to go giving them

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.170 
them more places to go giving them
especially<00:04:02.319> more<00:04:03.319> freedom<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.920> explore<00:04:04.280> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
especially more freedom to explore the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.479 
especially more freedom to explore the
world<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.660> that's<00:04:05.900> kind<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.230> our<00:04:06.410> dream<00:04:07.040> is<00:04:07.280> to

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
world and that's kind of our dream is to

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.280 
world and that's kind of our dream is to
put<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.120> as<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.390> player<00:04:08.510> in<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.870> position<00:04:09.260> to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
put you as the player in the position to

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:24.760 
put you as the player in the position to
tell<00:04:09.560> any<00:04:09.829> story<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:11.060> can<00:04:11.209> about<00:04:11.390> it

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.800 

Oh
