I'm gonna be riding the orbiter it's one
of<00:00:07.220> the<00:00:07.309> original<00:00:07.399> rides<00:00:07.910> that<00:00:08.149> was<00:00:08.269> built

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
of the original rides that was built

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:20.740 
of the original rides that was built
here<00:00:08.690> in<00:00:09.129> 1981<00:00:10.129> let's<00:00:10.940> go

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.499 

so<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.180> on<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
so this is what it's like to go on the

00:00:24.509 --> 00:01:59.180 
so this is what it's like to go on the
orbiter

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.610 

so<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.340> was<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.640> orbiter<00:02:01.260> actually<00:02:02.260> quitted

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
so that was the orbiter actually quitted

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.800 
so that was the orbiter actually quitted
long<00:02:02.800> right<00:02:03.630> things<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.720> bit<00:02:04.870> longer<00:02:05.080> than

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
long right things a bit longer than

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.590 
long right things a bit longer than
nightmares<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.729> lot<00:02:09.850> of<00:02:09.880> g-forces<00:02:10.390> when

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
nightmares got a lot of g-forces when

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.090 
nightmares got a lot of g-forces when
you<00:02:10.690> come<00:02:10.869> down<00:02:10.900> to<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.320> ground<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.800> go<00:02:11.920> back

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
you come down to the ground and go back

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.380 
you come down to the ground and go back
up<00:02:12.280> again

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
up again

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.300 
up again
I'm<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.990> bit<00:02:14.230> heavier<00:02:14.560> than<00:02:14.800> following<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
I'm a bit heavier than following the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.360 
I'm a bit heavier than following the
most<00:02:15.520> most<00:02:16.060> people<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.960> didn't<00:02:17.590> stick<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:17.950> my

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
most most people so I didn't stick to my

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.970 
most most people so I didn't stick to my
seat<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.910> other<00:02:19.090> people<00:02:19.390> might<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.770> was

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
seat like other people might so I was

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.560 
seat like other people might so I was
kind<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.160> like<00:02:21.280> sliding<00:02:21.670> off<00:02:22.000> my<00:02:22.150> seat<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.420> I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
kind of like sliding off my seat so I

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.970 
kind of like sliding off my seat so I
wasn't<00:02:22.810> hanging<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.260> just<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> see<00:02:23.560> how<00:02:23.830> much

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
wasn't hanging on just to see how much

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.490 
wasn't hanging on just to see how much
g-force<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.580> actually<00:02:24.910> had<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.500> anyway

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
g-force that actually had on it anyway

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.600 
g-force that actually had on it anyway
so<00:02:26.530> next<00:02:26.950> time<00:02:27.100> you're<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.310> Canada's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
so next time you're at Canada's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.460 
so next time you're at Canada's
Wonderland<00:02:28.410> go<00:02:29.410> check<00:02:29.710> out<00:02:29.920> orbit
