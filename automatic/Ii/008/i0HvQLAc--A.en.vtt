00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
crap even I origin you it was and this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
crap even I origin you it was and this
just<00:00:47.100> paper<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.910> hold<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.329> place<00:00:48.480> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
everything but I think and probably work

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.700 
everything but I think and probably work
that<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.239> comes<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.870> spiderweb

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that out so it comes with this spiderweb

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
this slate version it looks slightly

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
this slate version it looks slightly
blurry<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.220> clip<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.770> round<00:01:43.770> like

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
blurry but just clip that on round like

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
blurry but just clip that on round like
that<00:01:46.130> might<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.250> doing<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.520> wrong<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.000> ok<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that might be doing this wrong but ok I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.200 
that might be doing this wrong but ok I
think<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.530> am<00:01:50.689> just<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.780> say

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.510 

ah<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.049> think<00:02:00.710> I've<00:02:00.799> got<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.950> wrong<00:02:01.220> with

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
ah I think I've got it wrong with

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.580 
ah I think I've got it wrong with
the<00:02:01.610> back<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.000> case<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:07.959> goes<00:02:08.959> on

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the back of the case so that goes on

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.720 
the back of the case so that goes on
over<00:02:09.890> there<00:02:11.260> nope<00:02:12.260> wrong<00:02:12.470> side<00:02:12.739> wrong<00:02:13.670> side

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
over there nope wrong side wrong side

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.020 
over there nope wrong side wrong side
again<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:15.130> was<00:02:16.130> putting<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.400> onto<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.700> long<00:02:16.880> way

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
again I was putting it onto a long way

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.550 
again I was putting it onto a long way
around<00:02:17.180> guys<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:17.870> that's<00:02:17.989> probably<00:02:18.230> why<00:02:18.500> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
around guys so that's probably why it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.580 
around guys so that's probably why it
wasn't<00:02:18.830> going<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.989> let's<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.290> put<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.470> in

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
wasn't going on so let's just put it in

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.160 
wasn't going on so let's just put it in
through<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> replication<00:02:25.209> alright<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.930> goes

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
through the replication alright so goes

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:36.880 
through the replication alright so goes
this<00:02:27.800> way<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:31.180> Shaitaan<00:02:32.180> into<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:35.890> to

I never really made my mind up with what
you<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.730> think<00:04:05.940> I'm<00:04:06.030> going<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.180> stay

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
with this one for quite a while the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.920 
with this one for quite a while the
price<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.190> expensive<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.480> worth<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.870> i

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
price is expensive but it's worth it i

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.300 
price is expensive but it's worth it i
mean<00:04:10.110> you're<00:04:10.890> less<00:04:11.430> likely<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:12.770> break<00:04:13.770> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
mean you're less likely to break the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.890 
mean you're less likely to break the
screen<00:04:14.520> on<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.880> because<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.270> got<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.450> lifted

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
screen on it because it's got a lifted

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.650 
screen on it because it's got a lifted
rubber<00:04:16.230> back<00:04:16.500> rubber<00:04:17.010> foot<00:04:17.220> on<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.389> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
rubber back rubber foot on it so the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.430 
rubber back rubber foot on it so the
grass<00:04:18.840> doesn't<00:04:19.049> actually<00:04:19.260> touch<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.389> surface

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
grass doesn't actually touch the surface

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.960 
grass doesn't actually touch the surface
same<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.710> camera<00:04:23.040> because<00:04:23.460> before<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
same with the camera because before the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.150 
same with the camera because before the
cameras<00:04:24.300> stepped<00:04:24.630> out<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.200> used<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.560> boob

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
cameras stepped out and it used to boob

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.860 
cameras stepped out and it used to boob
against<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.490> surface<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.450> does<00:04:27.600> make<00:04:27.720> the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
against the surface it does make the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.360 
against the surface it does make the
phone<00:04:28.050> more<00:04:28.230> bulkier<00:04:28.680> but<00:04:28.889> that<00:04:29.010> means<00:04:29.190> you

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
phone more bulkier but that means you

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.340
