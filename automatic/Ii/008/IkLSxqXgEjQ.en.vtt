00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 because you asked for it today I'm going to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.500
 teach my basic routine and corrector in 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.019
 spring I like to mix a base with 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 an illuminator with color so that my skin 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 look a lot more natural and the way 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.320
 which I like to apply is because 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.210
 sections because like that if you dry a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.430
 little the base or something is not going to be 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.470
 difficult to blur 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 of course you can recreate this without 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.310
 use anything that I use but 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.900
 yes I advise you to invest in a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.680
 fiber and flanders because it makes the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 makeup look much prettier 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.940
 As I told you, we are going to use my 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.460
 corrector in layers and I start with 1 color 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890
 salmon to help me neutralize the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.130
 purple and the sales that are near my 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.440
 eye bags 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.720
 to continue I use my mac corrector 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.730
 and I put a drop of facial oil 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.650
 so that it becomes more creamy and more 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.960
 easy to blur you do not have to do 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.300
 this but my skin is too dry and 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.980
 I feel like this I manage it better apart from 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.650
 apply this concealer in the area of 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.110
 circles under a little more so that 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.300
 my face looks more raised and a little 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.760
 more profiled if you are going to apply your 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.880
 layered concealer reminds you to do it in 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.490
 Thin layers and blend very well for 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.100
 that you do not see a heavy look and if 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.110
 I thought and it was over, not like 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.200
 I said I love applying layers of 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.500
 corrector and as last touch I use a 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.450
 Illuminator I use very little and more 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.320
 down again so that the face is 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.700
 see more awake and much more tipped 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.290
 to have my proofreader I'm using 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.509
 these two colors of the palette of 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.580
 contour anastasia I feel that makes 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.820
 my makeup stays in its place and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.010
 apart it makes me look a lot more awake 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.950
 what remains was not applied in zone t and in 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.990
 chin as I put my blush me 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.670
 applied a little fixative spray 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.650
 makeup so that my base and I 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.780
 corrector stay in place all the 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.010
 day and that's all I do as soon as 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.110
 to base and corrector 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.600

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.290
