00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
beginning you need to have the JDK or

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
ok now if you want to compile your own

ok now if you want to compile your own
servlets<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.279> mean<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> coding<00:00:27.060> work<00:00:27.330> then

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
servlets I mean do the coding work then

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
servlets I mean do the coding work then
you<00:00:27.930> must<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.710> JDK<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> Java

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
you must have the JDK because the Java

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.020 
you must have the JDK because the Java
compiler<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.050> Java<00:00:31.289> C<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> Angelica<00:00:32.369> only<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
compiler and Java C is Angelica only and

right in the system properties and paste

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.220 
right in the system properties and paste
it<00:04:06.450> again<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:09.220> then<00:04:09.430> okay<00:04:09.819> so<00:04:10.000> now<00:04:10.810> in<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:10.959> java

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
it again and then okay so now in a java

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.289 
it again and then okay so now in a java

itself<00:04:22.150> depends<00:04:22.479> on<00:04:22.600> java<00:04:22.830> now<00:04:23.830> once<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.190> have

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
itself depends on java now once you have

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.600 
itself depends on java now once you have
done<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.610> what<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.750> simply<00:04:26.139> need<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.530> do<00:04:27.340> is

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
done this what you simply need to do is

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.670 
done this what you simply need to do is
whenever<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.419> need<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.720> start<00:04:29.110> yourself

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
whenever you need to start yourself

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560 
whenever you need to start yourself
I<00:04:29.710> mean<00:04:29.919> Apache<00:04:30.160> Tomcat<00:04:30.400> this<00:04:31.180> goal<00:04:31.419> you'll

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
I mean Apache Tomcat this goal you'll

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.090 
I mean Apache Tomcat this goal you'll
see<00:04:31.780> Tomcat<00:04:32.590> six<00:04:33.539> then<00:04:34.539> folder<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.740> here<00:04:35.949> is

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
see Tomcat six then folder and here is

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.029 
see Tomcat six then folder and here is
this<00:04:36.220> startup<00:04:36.669> dot<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.410> batch<00:04:38.800> file

this startup dot that is a batch file

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.189 
this startup dot that is a batch file
just<00:04:39.820> double<00:04:40.090> click<00:04:40.270> on<00:04:40.389> it<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:43.750> will<00:04:43.780> start

just double click on it it will start

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:51.029 
just double click on it it will start

yourself see something going on and we

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.390 
yourself see something going on and we

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
so you started up the server now what

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.840 
so you started up the server now what
you<00:06:02.520> have<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.760> do<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:03.120> like<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.660> have<00:06:03.870> some

you have to do is like you have some

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.340 
you have to do is like you have some
your<00:06:05.850> web<00:06:06.120> just<00:06:06.480> be<00:06:06.600> files<00:06:06.810> with<00:06:06.960> your<00:06:07.080> friend

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
your web just be files with your friend

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.340 
your web just be files with your friend
gave<00:06:07.530> you<00:06:07.710> so<00:06:08.370> like<00:06:08.580> this<00:06:08.760> you<00:06:08.940> just<00:06:09.810> copy<00:06:10.140> them

gave you so like this you just copy them

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.880 
gave you so like this you just copy them
here<00:06:10.620> okay<00:06:11.270> like<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.480> have<00:06:12.630> copied<00:06:12.990> this<00:06:13.110> folder

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
here okay like I have copied this folder

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:21.200 
here okay like I have copied this folder
and<00:06:15.890> now<00:06:16.890> put<00:06:17.760> all<00:06:17.850> your<00:06:17.970> files<00:06:18.180> okay<00:06:20.210> I'll

actually I think I'll be detailing this
all<00:06:23.220> this<00:06:23.370> by<00:06:23.520> buying<00:06:23.730> a<00:06:23.880> fan<00:06:24.060> closet<00:06:24.480> stuff

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
all this by buying a fan closet stuff

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.030
