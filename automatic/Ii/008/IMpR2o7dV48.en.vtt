00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
you can see that the smokies slow us

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.430 
you can see that the smokies slow us
down<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.820> little<00:03:13.120> bit<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.630> they<00:03:13.810> don't<00:03:14.020> prevent

in the new walkman application this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.670 
in the new walkman application this
application<00:03:54.760> looks<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.780> lot<00:03:55.930> like<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
application looks a lot like the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.570

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
navigation on a PSP or ps3 if we go to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.690 
navigation on a PSP or ps3 if we go to
the<00:04:00.790> music<00:04:01.150> library<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:03.370> it

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
the music library you can see that it

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.610 
the music library you can see that it
has<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:04.150> very<00:04:05.190> similar<00:04:06.190> display<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.380> if<00:04:08.380> i<00:04:08.590> zoom

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
has a very similar display and if i zoom

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.280 
has a very similar display and if i zoom
out<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.610> see<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.269> we<00:04:10.510> can<00:04:10.750> move<00:04:10.989> through

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
out you can see that we can move through

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.070 
out you can see that we can move through
it<00:04:11.350> just<00:04:12.340> by<00:04:12.489> using<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.209> d-pad<00:04:13.660> without

the accelerometer is used in this

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.280 
the accelerometer is used in this
application<00:04:37.460> it's<00:04:38.150> rather<00:04:38.420> odd<00:04:38.720> it's<00:04:39.020> called

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
application it's rather odd it's called

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.280 
application it's rather odd it's called
shake<00:04:39.620> control<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:41.090> what<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.420> need<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.660> do<00:04:41.990> is

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
shake control so what you need to do is

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
shake the phone left to right and if you

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.700 
shake the phone left to right and if you
do<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.220> correctly<00:04:49.400> then<00:04:50.390> it'll<00:04:50.900> switch<00:04:51.200> tracks

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
do it correctly then it'll switch tracks

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.130 
do it correctly then it'll switch tracks
it's<00:04:52.640> kind<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.060> hard<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.390> do<00:04:53.630> with<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.930> phone

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
it's kind of hard to do with the phone
