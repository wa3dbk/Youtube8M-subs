connector is also fully exposed now

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.330 
connector is also fully exposed now
because<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> case<00:01:52.719> is<00:01:52.780> rather<00:01:53.110> thin<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:54.189> is

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
because the case is rather thin this is

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.490 
because the case is rather thin this is
going<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.549> fit<00:01:54.759> most<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.270> your<00:01:55.509> car<00:01:55.960> adapters

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
going to fit most of your car adapters

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620 
going to fit most of your car adapters
so<00:01:56.799> I<00:01:57.640> know<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.060> could<00:01:58.299> be<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.420> hassle

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
so I know that could be a hassle

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.349 
so I know that could be a hassle
especially<00:01:59.229> with<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.829> apple<00:02:00.579> bumper<00:02:00.820> where

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
especially with the apple bumper where

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.300 
especially with the apple bumper where
