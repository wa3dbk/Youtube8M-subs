hey guys welcome back

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.410 
hey guys welcome back
Sergi<00:00:07.569> this<00:00:07.749> contraption<00:00:08.140> last<00:00:08.650> video<00:00:09.420> I'll

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
Sergi this contraption last video I'll

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.190 
Sergi this contraption last video I'll
try<00:00:10.990> to<00:00:11.049> explain<00:00:11.320> some<00:00:11.710> of<00:00:11.740> how<00:00:12.040> it<00:00:12.250> works

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
try to explain some of how it works

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.959 
try to explain some of how it works
we're<00:00:14.200> using<00:00:14.349> the<00:00:14.469> two<00:00:14.650> detector<00:00:15.160> rails<00:00:15.370> to

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
we're using the two detector rails to

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.260 
we're using the two detector rails to
determine<00:00:16.750> whether<00:00:17.370> the<00:00:18.370> cart<00:00:18.610> just<00:00:18.820> passes

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
determine whether the cart just passes

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.050 
determine whether the cart just passes
the<00:00:19.420> first<00:00:19.690> one<00:00:19.960> or<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:20.230> second<00:00:20.740> one<00:00:20.790> so<00:00:21.790> we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
the first one or the second one so we

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.140 
the first one or the second one so we
set<00:00:22.630> up<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:23.110> kind<00:00:24.070> of<00:00:24.160> hand<00:00:24.400> gate<00:00:24.610> between<00:00:24.790> the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
set up a kind of hand gate between the

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.080 
set up a kind of hand gate between the
two<00:00:25.330> and<00:00:25.720> when<00:00:26.620> the<00:00:26.800> cart<00:00:27.100> passes<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.910> first

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
two and when the cart passes the first

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.110 
two and when the cart passes the first
detector<00:00:28.840> rail<00:00:29.080> but<00:00:29.440> doesn't<00:00:29.860> pass<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.550> next

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
detector rail but doesn't pass the next

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.049 
detector rail but doesn't pass the next
detector<00:00:31.810> rail<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.290> set<00:00:32.500> amount<00:00:32.589> of<00:00:32.800> time

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
detector rail in a set amount of time

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.990 
detector rail in a set amount of time
it'll<00:00:34.059> trigger<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.600> line<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.519> redstone<00:00:36.519> that

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
it'll trigger a line of redstone that

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500 
it'll trigger a line of redstone that
comes<00:00:37.210> over<00:00:37.420> here<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.640> activate<00:00:39.640> activates

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
comes over here and activate activates

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.130 
comes over here and activate activates
the<00:00:40.749> contraption<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:43.480> two<00:00:43.749> separate

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
the contraption and there's two separate

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
the contraption and there's two separate
parts<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:45.730> first<00:00:45.909> part<00:00:46.089> is<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
parts to it the first part is the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.220 
parts to it the first part is the
Pistons<00:00:48.579> on<00:00:48.730> top<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.210> set<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.510> four<00:00:49.749> on<00:00:49.929> top

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
Pistons on top the set of four on top

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.180 
Pistons on top the set of four on top
and<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:51.789> expand<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.600> contract<00:00:53.190> separately

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
and those expand and contract separately

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.469 
and those expand and contract separately
and<00:00:56.819> when<00:00:57.819> they're<00:00:58.030> contracted<00:00:58.719> then<00:00:59.499> you<00:00:59.710> can

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
and when they're contracted then you can

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.000 
and when they're contracted then you can
bring<00:01:01.479> up<00:01:01.659> the<00:01:01.809> other<00:01:02.050> set<00:01:02.319> of<00:01:02.350> four<00:01:02.589> Pistons

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
bring up the other set of four Pistons

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.710 
bring up the other set of four Pistons
that<00:01:03.219> will<00:01:03.370> reach<00:01:03.550> out<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:03.909> grab<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.420> rail

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
that will reach out and grab the rail

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.920 
that will reach out and grab the rail
and<00:01:05.020> drag<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.680> back<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:07.030> edible<00:01:07.420> when<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.720> turn

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
and drag it back so edible when you turn

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.020 
and drag it back so edible when you turn
it<00:01:08.050> on<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.470> reaches<00:01:08.770> out<00:01:08.950> grabs<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.490> rail<00:01:09.700> and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
it on it reaches out grabs the rail and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.840 
it on it reaches out grabs the rail and
then<00:01:10.870> it<00:01:11.020> pulls<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.530> back<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:12.010> drops<00:01:12.220> down<00:01:12.490> and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
then it pulls it back and drops down and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.990 
then it pulls it back and drops down and
then<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.810> other<00:01:13.960> one<00:01:14.170> will<00:01:15.160> push<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.730> rail

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
then the other one will push that rail

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.420 
then the other one will push that rail
back<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.420> place<00:01:16.720> once<00:01:17.110> once<00:01:17.470> you've<00:01:17.740> opened

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
back in place once once you've opened

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.750 
back in place once once you've opened
the<00:01:18.760> hole<00:01:19.320> me<00:01:22.800> open<00:01:23.800> this<00:01:23.890> one<00:01:24.040> up<00:01:24.190> too<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:24.670> we

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
the hole me open this one up too so we

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.460 
the hole me open this one up too so we
can<00:01:24.910> see<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.420> known<00:01:25.690> as<00:01:25.720> well<00:01:28.050> all<00:01:29.050> right<00:01:29.230> so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
can see that known as well all right so

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.760 
can see that known as well all right so
basically<00:01:30.130> how<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.660> order<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.410> which<00:01:32.440> it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
basically how it the order in which it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.840 
basically how it the order in which it
works<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:35.020> will<00:01:35.680> contract<00:01:36.100> first

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
works is this will contract first

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.260 
works is this will contract first
bring<00:01:37.510> those<00:01:37.780> blocks<00:01:38.110> out<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.560> way<00:01:39.270> then

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
bring those blocks out of the way then

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.520 
bring those blocks out of the way then
the<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:43.270> rails<00:01:43.510> will<00:01:43.750> get<00:01:43.900> drawn<00:01:44.200> back

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the the rails will get drawn back

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.190 
the the rails will get drawn back
through<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.490> one<00:01:46.980> then<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:49.630> will<00:01:50.020> be

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
through this one then these will be

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.900 
through this one then these will be
pulled<00:01:50.830> back<00:01:51.390> dropping<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.720> cart<00:01:53.580> down<00:01:54.580> into

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
pulled back dropping the cart down into

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.380 
pulled back dropping the cart down into
the<00:01:55.000> hole<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.430> gets<00:01:57.610> pushed<00:01:57.940> back<00:01:58.060> into

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
the hole then this gets pushed back into

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.910 
the hole then this gets pushed back into
place<00:01:59.100> then<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.910> set<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:01.960> four<00:02:02.200> up<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.350> is

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
place then the set of four up here is

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.300 
place then the set of four up here is
expanded<00:02:03.910> again<00:02:04.180> pushing<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.900> back<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:08.310> that's

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
expanded again pushing it back so that's

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.589 
expanded again pushing it back so that's
the<00:02:09.670> order<00:02:09.939> and<00:02:10.179> how<00:02:10.299> it<00:02:10.420> works<00:02:10.659> obviously

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
the order and how it works obviously

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.630 
the order and how it works obviously
it's<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.200> little<00:02:12.469> more<00:02:12.680> complicated<00:02:13.040> than<00:02:13.430> that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
it's a little more complicated than that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's a little more complicated than that
I<00:02:14.510> might<00:02:14.840> go<00:02:14.989> through<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.549> do<00:02:16.549> some

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
I might go through and do some

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.140 
I might go through and do some
individual<00:02:17.120> tutorials<00:02:17.659> on<00:02:17.810> some<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.139> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
individual tutorials on some of the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.119 
individual tutorials on some of the
mechanisms<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.329> here<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.799> gives<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.040> an

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
mechanisms in here that gives you an

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.739 
mechanisms in here that gives you an
idea<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.489> how<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.180> basic<00:02:24.730> thing<00:02:25.730> works<00:02:26.120> thanks

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:26.749 
idea of how the basic thing works thanks

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:32.840 
idea of how the basic thing works thanks
for<00:02:26.840> watching

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.910
