00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.830
 circle tv and today we talk about this 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.849
 Tank like from 6 I rolled it out 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.980
 yesterday's stream 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.389
 can go see if it is you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 very interested 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.460
 characteristics stand on the screen, see 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 and I will say something like here and how to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.800
 Sorry the gun here is sad on 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.529
 Bebashkah penetration in 175 is a little she 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 goldie 217 which is also not too much 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.480
 sometimes it hits yes it's a tank getting with 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 With 10 levels you will be with them 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
 rather suffer from lack 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.590
 breaking through also a weapon rather oblique a 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 comes down 3 6 tenths of a second 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 pechalbeda stabilization no one-off 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 damage of 820 units all in principle more 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 less normal recharge ten with 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.500
 half a second well, it is still possible to live 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 further armor is great here 180 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 millimeters forehead 180 bead just chic wasps 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.050
 this is a single single tank on 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.949
 which one can actually play from the board and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 and not just like that 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.970
 beat back enemy shells turret too in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 Overall pretty strong but certainly 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.619
 need to hide the lower armor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.780
 and hide all the same on top 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.549
 the tower has a commanding here's the gap 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 it can not be called turret commander 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.549
 but sat down in them, too, punches us at 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 good luck 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.049
 obviously for the enemy for us 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.689
 Of course it will be unpleasant if us 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.180
 there will be speeding a car 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.100
 in general, well, pretty fast for 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.200
 heavy tank course dynamics she has 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.509
 worse than the usual iso but its 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.150
 thirty kilometers there it is gaining and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.570
 that's good even more in principle she 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.850
 a little bit faster 32 will be happens 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.979
 but in any case you can't call her 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 slow she quite herself so goes 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 cheerfully you can not call her of course and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.159
 fast but also slow not call for 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.590
 heavy tank in principle itself is 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.509
 maneuverability and enough acceleration dynamics 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.450
 in principle, too, a sin on something 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.520
 complain and so what is the main thing 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.469
 actually we have this car then 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.750
 classes if we fall against 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.180
 eights then tank if we fall 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.789
 against the nines then gently tank 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.289
 because as level 8 almost never us 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.620
 will be able to pierce if we are correct 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.940
 we will be substituted once 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.560
 if they won't target us 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.319
 confectionary gap and in the lower armor list 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.599
 Well, level 9 unfortunately we will already be 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.950
 quite calmly punching but in this 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.530
 the battle will probably still be shown 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.299
 tanking here let's say from 4 shoots 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.209
 Of course not punching well, we 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.519
 draw together the best tactic on this 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.709
 tank against opponents to come closer 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.290
 then they will not be able to target our lower 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.909
 bronelist and the almost complete absence 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.129
 commander towers gives us the opportunity 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.810
 shoot 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.640
 oh the opportunity for us to defend against 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.950
 shooting at this very commanding 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
 turrets then there is a melee machine in 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.209
 clinch a pretty good looks and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.099
 you will fall from your oblique 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.510
 guns are very easy that is the most important 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.700
 tactic to come closer 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.340
 there is still such a problem unfortunately 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.200
 the car is low and if you are against 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.940
 any there I will not find the first thing 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 we get this e100 well, hardly of course 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.739
 you will be clavicle with e100 anything 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.409
 any high machine m103 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.120
 whose guns are high to 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.190
 it is better for him not to drive up in the clinch 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.680
 will beat you just to the roof of the tower so 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.840
 how low a car is he can easily with this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.910
 cope well and you will at this time 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.730
 Of course rake because you 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.709
 drove you easy to heal and he 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.329
 the gun is higher than the actual 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.879
 your roof tower is it just be there 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.799
 not even a goal with the principle of sewing you new 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.400
 from this no profit is of course not 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.400
 so this fight goes right to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.970
 his epic phase zavyazochki phase 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.940
 we see here 128 we have t32 literally 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.799
 on one bunch in his direction I decide what 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.569
 need to help him especially t28 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.760
 the only nine remaining would be 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.709
 shoot her all the same here 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.989
 driving up closer shooting at the board not 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.510
 punching over well basically know the rock on 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.910
 90 percent was sure not to break 28 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.049
 he finishes our royal tiger 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.940
 trouble begins here 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.949
 our speed is not enough to 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.620
 spin this car as it spins on 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:08.349
 pretty quickly shoot again 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.540
 unfortunately unfortunately it was necessary to aim 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.269
 after all she zadok there shove 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.340
 armor piercing but did not work out plus right now 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.180
 at least once hit but she starts 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.090
 unfold 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.070
 starts somehow trying to turn around 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.840
 in order to finish me off but sees 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.610
 in front of another of our ally 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.310
 deny the deuce which is unclear why 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.010
 decided to go there and finishes her 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.020
 Of course, without problems, I aim her 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.490
 hatch with our breakthrough only 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.070
 the place where it could be pierced 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.650
 and literally miraculously somehow not having time 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.110
 she could easily get a shell from her 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.330
 of course aim anything though 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.310
 she has one problem for her 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.590
 guns somewhere on the level of our top 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.090
 bronelista there wildest tilt 180 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.520
 millimeters so not the fact that she would 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.710
 we were also broken through the biggest problem 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.540
 the fact that the enemy takes the base 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.550
 but my speed is still not 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.870
 say so as to have a medium tank yes and 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.139
 plus there are three of them left 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.419
 and I am 1 and I would not say that 701 object 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.490
 or panther 2 are not considered serious 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.290
 opponents, quite the contrary, they 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.229
 quite dangerous especially the panther with her 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.570
 we charge gold with an exact gun 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.580
 projectiles just in case random 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.729
 bounce us now generally to anything 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.010
 so it's better to be safe I'm 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.990
 I chasing Panther see what we have and 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.850
 here she is waiting for shooting at her too 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.490
 punching through the rink as far as I am 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.169
 I understand, but I myself actually get 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.610
 I understand that with one shot I am her 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.700
 most likely now I do not take 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.680
 and the time remains well, that's quite a bit and 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.500
 it turns out that most likely us now 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.450
 just take out to capture the base I understand 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.030
 that since it is so necessary to at least finish 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.460
 panther and I understand that she will now 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.139
 I go around disappearing their light it 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.210
 important it was necessary to disappear from the light 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.010
 because maybe she would think 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.919
 that I drove her apparently she 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.050
 so I thought I was going back and so 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.450
 the most a little deceiving she leaves here 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.940
 and don't expect me just get it right away 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.280
 in board unfortunately as I thought alpha 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.900
 damage is missing this brooke literally here 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.750
 these few seconds I later 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.430
 enough yes already she has prowled me 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.320
 again punches on happy 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.630
 chance or not but in principle I was 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.300
 to her almost completely substituted board 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.430
 realizing that you need to go to the database is no longer 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.919
 not looking at anything even on this panther 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.310
 shoot literally not coming down getting about 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.740
 the miracle of the Soviet gun fails in its 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.599
 cosiness and literally from the guard distributes 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.660
 I still understand that for 20 seconds I 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:34.810
 most likely I don't have time to get there 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.940
 and it's a pity already for almost 9 thousand damage in a battle with 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.069
 Nines Five Frags Want a Warrior 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.770
 but it's clear that everything is already here 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.870
 sad food realizing that now 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.910
 the enemy will light up and maybe 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.740
 get something done do it 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.410
 I bring it I realize what time 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.259
 it remains to shoot and ricochet gold 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.530
 shells decoction because he is the selection then the tiger 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:58.690
 This sadness trouble and defeat but the battle was 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.610
 quite interesting I got a lot 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.190
 pleasures and opponents judging by 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.620
 all with you too there was a glitch circle tv 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.139
 I hope you enjoyed this fight further 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.120
 there will be new cars well, and good luck to you 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.120
 bye for now
