00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.620
 welcome to my channel i'm ness 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.170
 as you have already read from the title 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.770
 we will talk about Christmas of the period 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 Christmassy 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.590
 I personally love Christmas lights 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 the magic the atmosphere the gifts the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.730
 family gifts and those decorations 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.189
 a bit bizarre as a Santa Claus 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.119
 attached to the balconies of the houses they 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.830
 gifts seem to hang in my house 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 he has always made the tree then I have 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.119
 transferred and we have not done more 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.800
 the tree I don't know why 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 and then I remedied them by buying 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.250
 This is a statuette of a Santa Claus 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.079
 fly that I exhibit at Christmas time 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 then this year you can see it here is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.590
 arrived the tree is back they have it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.579
 given as a child I keep it in my room 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 mine and a bit of Christmas spirit i 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.870
 lunches I think the Christmas dinners are 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.539
 something magnificent especially now 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 that I live alone and represent one 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.239
 of the few chances of eating 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.620
 something 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 I say lunches and dinners because being mine 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.180
 separated parents I find myself having a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.390
 lots of families that means so much 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.820
 love so much food and many gifts of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.369
 Usually the Christmas Eve dinner lunch 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.439
 Christmas and Christmas dinner is not 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.080
 that you save me from tortellini and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.900
 whenever i can the only thing a little 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.720
 sad about Christmas is that families that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.509
 unite often unfortunately they are 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 happy only in that day and not the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.210
 rest of the year 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.560
 at this point I don't understand if they do 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 pretend to be happy 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.759
 or if that day really makes 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 forget the problems for a while at least 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.490
 reflection by my cousin I wanted it 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.649
 peddle for my martini beat 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.470
 apart from that at christmas one thing that suits me 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.750
 like are gifts for example ho 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.060
 received this beautiful shirt of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770
 breaking bad from my uncles to whom 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 I recommended to see this series 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 the year devoured they could not 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.620
 stop looking at them and thank me 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.330
 given this when I opened the 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.400
 package looked like a cradle to me 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.350
 marnate no they sell now with the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.480
 watch the blue angels 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.979

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.870
 meaning that they are useful but they are a little bit 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.690
 Christmas spirit 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.820

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.810
 family members break the balls to look 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.910
 the gifts are approached and released 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.799
 50 euros saying for the petrol of the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.180
 scooter pig sucks grandfather if I do 50 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.930
 money is useful I can buy the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.220
 video equipment the case of my mom 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.630
 It is good that he gave me gods 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.400
 money because last year he got me 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.799

 relatives parents grandfather mom had been 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.500

 they arrest me in my father's house 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.049
 in short, Christmas is the day, the period 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.299
 I also like the year I prefer 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.660
 walking for gifts for hours 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.910
 below zero becoming poor sea ​​for 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.610
 see even for a moment the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.459
 smile on the face of a friend of a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.959
 relative or a person we care about 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.519
 then who changes them in nature 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.350

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.299
