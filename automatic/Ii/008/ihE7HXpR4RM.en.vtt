00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the key to activate fraps there's about

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
the key to activate fraps there's about
half<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:12.030> hour<00:01:12.180> before<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.720> happens<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.260> him

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
half an hour before that happens of him

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
half an hour before that happens of him
just<00:01:13.590> doing<00:01:13.890> nothing<00:01:14.130> standing<00:01:14.939> around<00:01:15.210> in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
just doing nothing standing around in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
just doing nothing standing around in
our<00:01:15.600> base<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.799> why<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> audio<00:01:17.490> quality

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
our base this is why the audio quality

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.880 
our base this is why the audio quality
is<00:01:18.030> quite<00:01:18.299> bad<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> microphone<00:01:19.860> was

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
is quite bad because the microphone was

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
is quite bad because the microphone was
laying<00:01:20.310> across<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> room<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.390> had<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
laying across the room and I had to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.780 
laying across the room and I had to
boost<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> volume<00:01:22.430> significantly<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.700> be

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
boost the volume significantly to be

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
boost the volume significantly to be
able<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.119> hear<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:25.520> secondly

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
able to hear what was going on secondly
