00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
so let's move away from that and we've

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.989 
so let's move away from that and we've
also<00:02:18.319> got<00:02:18.590> some<00:02:18.799> League<00:02:18.980> specs<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.579> galaxy

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
s4 active where you will be pretty much

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.940 
s4 active where you will be pretty much
getting<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.060> same<00:02:23.359> galaxy<00:02:23.659> s4<00:02:24.409> on<00:02:24.530> different

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950

chassis<00:02:25.159> we<00:02:25.549> already<00:02:25.849> knew<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.450> only

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
chassis we already knew that the only

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.690

difference<00:02:27.139> is<00:02:27.260> sadly<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.189> will<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.519> getting

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
difference is sadly you will be getting

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.699 
difference is sadly you will be getting
