step<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:07.250> create<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.789> selection<00:02:08.360> from<00:02:09.350> this

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
step is to create a selection from this

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.920 
step is to create a selection from this
striped<00:02:10.009> paper<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:11.030> go<00:02:11.300> over<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.600> your<00:02:11.720> tool

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
striped paper so go over to your tool

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
striped paper so go over to your tool
bat<00:02:12.170> bar<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.860> grab<00:02:13.040> your<00:02:13.310> rectangular

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
bat bar and grab your rectangular

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.320 
bat bar and grab your rectangular
marquee<00:02:14.090> tool<00:02:14.890> be<00:02:15.890> sure<00:02:15.920> feather<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.640> set<00:02:16.849> to<00:02:17.030> 0

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
marquee tool be sure feather is set to 0

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.400 
marquee tool be sure feather is set to 0
so<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:17.900> will<00:02:18.170> get

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
so that will get

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.860 
so that will get
crisp<00:02:18.680> clean<00:02:19.130> edge<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:19.850> our<00:02:20.000> selection<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
crisp clean edge on our selection and
