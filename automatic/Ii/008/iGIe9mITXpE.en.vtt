the<00:03:46.530> 4a<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:47.099> guard<00:03:47.370> by<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> bunch<00:03:47.849> of<00:03:47.909> frostbites

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
the 4a is guard by a bunch of frostbites

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.009 
the 4a is guard by a bunch of frostbites
spider<00:03:49.349> some<00:03:49.650> take<00:03:50.010> them<00:03:50.250> out<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.659> at<00:03:51.659> this

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
spider some take them out and at this

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.390 
spider some take them out and at this
point<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.409> game<00:03:52.440> they<00:03:52.709> shouldn't<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.129> too

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
point in the game they shouldn't be too

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.990 
point in the game they shouldn't be too
hard<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.790> take<00:03:54.000> care<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:55.620> always

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
hard to take care of but just always

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.399 
hard to take care of but just always
some<00:03:57.000> caution<00:03:57.389> because<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.629> do<00:03:57.689> use<00:03:57.900> frost<00:03:58.229> by

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
some caution because I do use frost by

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.839 
some caution because I do use frost by
better<00:03:58.650> than<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.889> can<00:03:59.069> do<00:03:59.220> damage<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.579> your

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
better than that can do damage to your

better than that can do damage to your
health<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.239> stamina<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.810> that's<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.109> thing

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
health and stamina so that's the thing

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
health and stamina so that's the thing
to<00:04:01.620> take<00:04:01.769> into<00:04:02.069> consideration<00:04:02.359> however<00:04:04.280> after

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
to take into consideration however after

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.460 
to take into consideration however after
that<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.239> lever<00:04:06.419> has<00:04:06.629> been<00:04:06.750> for<00:04:07.049> just<00:04:07.319> make

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that so the lever has been for just make

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.699 
that so the lever has been for just make
sure<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.739> head<00:04:07.889> toward<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.280> exit<00:04:09.439> which<00:04:10.439> is<00:04:10.470> a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
sure you head toward the exit which is a

wooden door so after taking care of the

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.460 
wooden door so after taking care of the
frostbite<00:04:14.609> spiders<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.239> pulling<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.289> lever

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
frostbite spiders and pulling the lever

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.689 
frostbite spiders and pulling the lever
make<00:04:16.709> sure<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.949> head<00:04:17.070> back<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.400> wooden

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
make sure to head back to the wooden

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.830 
make sure to head back to the wooden
bridge<00:04:17.820> because<00:04:18.150> that's<00:04:18.299> where<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:18.599> door

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
bridge because that's where the door

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.439 
bridge because that's where the door
toward<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.919> courtyard<00:04:20.609> would<00:04:20.729> be<00:04:20.849> so<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
toward the courtyard would be so a

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.379 
toward the courtyard would be so a
little<00:04:21.900> tip<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.529> can<00:04:22.740> get<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> pretty<00:04:23.940> hard<00:04:24.180> to

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
little tip it can get a pretty hard to

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.540 
little tip it can get a pretty hard to
keep<00:04:25.229> track<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.529> where<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.950> are<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.159> this

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
surrounded we'll talk about how

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.980

beautiful<00:04:59.400> this<00:04:59.490> place<00:04:59.729> used<00:04:59.939> to<00:05:00.060> be<00:05:00.180> how<00:05:00.479> the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
beautiful this place used to be how the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.839 
beautiful this place used to be how the
Champa's<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.680> our<00:05:01.740> Father<00:05:02.099> destroyed<00:05:02.610> and

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
Champa's and our Father destroyed and

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.149 
Champa's and our Father destroyed and
everything<00:05:02.969> like<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.919> basically<00:05:04.919> she

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
everything like that and basically she

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.240 
everything like that and basically she
points<00:05:05.580> out<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.909> moon<00:05:06.330> die<00:05:06.659> which<00:05:07.439> is<00:05:07.650> missing<00:05:08.099> a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
points out a moon die which is missing a

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.240 
points out a moon die which is missing a
few<00:05:08.490> of<00:05:08.639> its<00:05:08.729> crest<00:05:09.150> so<00:05:09.840> what<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:10.830> need<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.099> do

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
few of its crest so what you need to do

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.089 
few of its crest so what you need to do
is<00:05:11.460> put<00:05:11.969> in<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.389> missing<00:05:12.569> crest<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.949> the

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
is put in the missing crest so that the

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.469 
is put in the missing crest so that the
moon<00:05:14.310> dials<00:05:14.729> they<00:05:14.849> would<00:05:14.969> have<00:05:15.060> functioned

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
moon dials they would have functioned

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.080 
moon dials they would have functioned
properly<00:05:15.659> so<00:05:16.169> that<00:05:16.199> our<00:05:16.469> first<00:05:16.710> crest<00:05:17.099> will<00:05:17.909> be

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
properly so that our first crest will be

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.570 
properly so that our first crest will be
inside<00:05:18.599> of<00:05:18.629> the<00:05:18.839> little<00:05:19.110> pond<00:05:19.500> with<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.279> bunch

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
inside of the little pond with a bunch

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.519 
inside of the little pond with a bunch
of<00:05:20.669> mushrooms<00:05:21.000> in<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.659> you<00:05:21.900> just<00:05:21.930> need<00:05:22.500> to

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
of mushrooms in it and you just need to

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.610 
of mushrooms in it and you just need to
pick<00:05:22.889> up<00:05:22.919> the<00:05:23.129> crest<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:24.229> head<00:05:25.229> toward<00:05:25.589> the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
pick up the crest and head toward the

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.739 
pick up the crest and head toward the
spot<00:05:26.009> where<00:05:26.699> it<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:26.969> missing<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.569> it<00:05:27.659> will

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:27.749 
spot where it is missing and it will
