why<00:04:40.439> is<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.590> bit<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.889> a<00:04:40.979> mishmash<00:04:41.759> of<00:04:42.330> different

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
why is a bit of a mishmash of different

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.850 
why is a bit of a mishmash of different
sort<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.460> body<00:04:44.699> parts<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:47.270> skin<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.449> metal

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
sort of body parts and skin and metal

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.179 
sort of body parts and skin and metal
okay<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.340> his<00:04:50.460> robot<00:04:50.939> face<00:04:51.889> this<00:04:52.889> is<00:04:53.069> what

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
okay this is his robot face this is what

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.279 
okay this is his robot face this is what
he<00:04:53.280> uses<00:04:53.520> when<00:04:54.330> he<00:04:54.389> wants<00:04:54.569> to<00:04:54.599> be<00:04:54.750> intelligent

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
he uses when he wants to be intelligent

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.689 
he uses when he wants to be intelligent
or<00:04:55.409> indeed<00:04:55.680> he<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:55.949> still<00:04:56.189> fight<00:04:56.400> in<00:04:56.430> this

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
or indeed he can still fight in this

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.179 
or indeed he can still fight in this
mode<00:04:56.939> as<00:04:57.090> well<00:04:57.469> but<00:04:58.469> he<00:04:58.560> turns<00:04:58.800> into<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:59.039> bit<00:04:59.159> of

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
mode as well but he turns into a bit of

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.749 
mode as well but he turns into a bit of
a<00:04:59.370> Robocop<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.479> thought<00:05:00.689> scanners<00:05:01.229> and

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
a Robocop you thought scanners and

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.580 
a Robocop you thought scanners and
things<00:05:02.759> he<00:05:02.909> can<00:05:03.060> use<00:05:03.449> to<00:05:03.629> aim<00:05:03.990> his<00:05:04.139> gun<00:05:04.349> with

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
things he can use to aim his gun with

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.029 
things he can use to aim his gun with
and<00:05:04.889> all<00:05:04.979> kinds<00:05:05.310> of<00:05:05.370> stuff<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:07.800> says

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
and all kinds of stuff and that says

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.760 
and all kinds of stuff and that says
that<00:05:08.310> those<00:05:08.550> are<00:05:08.699> his<00:05:08.789> three<00:05:08.939> modes<00:05:10.699> robot

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
that those are his three modes robot

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.189 
that those are his three modes robot
monster<00:05:13.770> looks<00:05:14.340> worthy<00:05:15.529> non-step<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:18.199> then

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
monster looks worthy non-step and then

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.969 
monster looks worthy non-step and then
the<00:05:19.650> human<00:05:20.009> face<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.979> is<00:05:23.129> many<00:05:23.400> faces

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
the human face and that is many faces

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.480 
the human face and that is many faces
and<00:05:25.979> I<00:05:26.159> still<00:05:26.490> think<00:05:26.819> to<00:05:27.599> this<00:05:27.750> day<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:29.370> it

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
and I still think to this day that it

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.390 
and I still think to this day that it
was<00:05:29.520> many<00:05:29.849> faces<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.509> inspired<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.400> concept

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
was many faces that inspired the concept

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.719 
was many faces that inspired the concept
and<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.789> idea<00:05:32.819> for<00:05:34.129> Transformers<00:05:35.129> Animated

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
and the idea for Transformers Animated

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.100 
and the idea for Transformers Animated
bullet<00:05:36.629> swing

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
bullet swing

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.290 
bullet swing
Blitzwing<00:05:37.830> obviously<00:05:38.279> is<00:05:38.400> as<00:05:38.580> we<00:05:38.969> know<00:05:39.120> has

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
Blitzwing obviously is as we know has

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.070 
Blitzwing obviously is as we know has
three<00:05:39.539> faces<00:05:39.960> as<00:05:40.080> well<00:05:40.370> totally<00:05:41.370> different

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
three faces as well totally different

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.930 
three faces as well totally different
characters<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.469> this<00:05:43.589> guy<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.460> think<00:05:44.759> the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
characters to this guy but I think the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.839 
characters to this guy but I think the
concept<00:05:45.360> came<00:05:45.990> from<00:05:46.199> this<00:05:46.349> character<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:47.069> don't

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
concept came from this character I don't

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.459 
concept came from this character I don't
think<00:05:48.120> if<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.389> think<00:05:48.569> if<00:05:48.629> manufactures<00:05:49.199> didn't

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
think if I think if manufactures didn't

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.649 
think if I think if manufactures didn't
exist<00:05:49.830> we<00:05:50.520> would<00:05:50.699> not<00:05:50.849> see<00:05:51.089> animated

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
exist we would not see animated

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.499 
exist we would not see animated
Blitzwing<00:05:52.139> as<00:05:52.379> he<00:05:52.560> is<00:05:52.650> today<00:05:52.800> I<00:05:53.210> still<00:05:54.210> think

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
Blitzwing as he is today I still think

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.480 
Blitzwing as he is today I still think
in<00:05:55.259> my<00:05:55.379> heart<00:05:55.529> of<00:05:55.650> hearts<00:05:55.949> that<00:05:56.009> that's<00:05:56.279> where

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
in my heart of hearts that that's where

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.179 
in my heart of hearts that that's where
this<00:05:56.639> came<00:05:56.909> that<00:05:57.240> that<00:05:57.930> this<00:05:58.110> guy<00:05:58.349> is<00:05:59.009> where

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
this came that that this guy is where

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.709 
this came that that this guy is where
animated<00:05:59.610> Blitzwing<00:06:00.000> came<00:06:00.210> from<00:06:00.419> or<00:06:00.599> the

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
animated Blitzwing came from or the

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.310 
animated Blitzwing came from or the
concept<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.439> him<00:06:01.560> came<00:06:01.740> from

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.330
