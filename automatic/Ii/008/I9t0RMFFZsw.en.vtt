00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
diamond so you're gonna need a diamond

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
diamond so you're gonna need a diamond
and<00:00:31.920> flint<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.079> craft<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and flint like that craft in the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.990 
and flint like that craft in the
crafting<00:00:34.559> table<00:00:34.620> obviously<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:35.460> you're

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
going to need a ice obsidian so you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700 
going to need a ice obsidian so you
can't<00:00:38.040> use<00:00:38.100> regular<00:00:38.550> snow<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.750> right<00:00:40.590> now

you<00:01:06.299> don't<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.570> build<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you don't know how to build it just you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
you don't know how to build it just you
know<00:01:07.830> another<00:01:08.460> poor<00:01:08.850> let's<00:01:09.030> say<00:01:09.150> build<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.650> so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
know another poor let's say build it so

know another poor let's say build it so
you're<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you're going to make it like that and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're going to make it like that and
then<00:01:12.630> oops<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.380> put<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.270> then

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
then oops I put that in there and then

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240 
then oops I put that in there and then
you<00:01:15.360> take<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> point<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.869> diamond<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.009> then

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you take the point in diamond and then

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.140 
you take the point in diamond and then
you're<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> go<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> actually

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
at those I make those because yeah why

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.300 
at those I make those because yeah why
not<00:01:42.229> okay<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:45.320> now<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> looks<00:01:46.799> like

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
not okay here we are now it looks like

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910 
not okay here we are now it looks like
we<00:01:48.210> spawn<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> cave<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.799> in

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
we spawn in the cave so i know that in

works

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
we're gonna let generate and then yeah

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.180 
we're gonna let generate and then yeah
okay<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.730> we're<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.330> here<00:02:20.599> i<00:02:20.860> spawned<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:22.160> a

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
kind of low so it looks like supposed to

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.640 
kind of low so it looks like supposed to
be<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.670> exact<00:02:38.000> opposite<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.510> another<00:02:38.750> they

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
be the exact opposite of another they

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.750 
be the exact opposite of another they
have<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.830> aether<00:02:40.130> but<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.550> supposed<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
have the aether but this is supposed to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.559 
have the aether but this is supposed to
be<00:02:40.819> kind<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.930> frozen<00:02:42.650> nether<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.569> yep

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
be kind of like the frozen nether so yep

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.479
