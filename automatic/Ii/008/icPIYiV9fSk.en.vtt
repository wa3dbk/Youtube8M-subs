00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
like Carnaby Street in the 60s and then

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.930 
like Carnaby Street in the 60s and then
like<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.500> disco<00:01:12.920> culture<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.369> 70s<00:01:13.880> and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
like the disco culture in the 70s and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.809 
like the disco culture in the 70s and
all<00:01:14.149> of<00:01:14.270> these<00:01:14.360> things<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:15.250> lead<00:01:16.250> into<00:01:16.520> what

fashions like now I think British style
is<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.819> best<00:01:19.850> in<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.330> world<00:01:20.479> because<00:01:21.229> it's<00:01:21.530> a

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
is the best in the world because it's a

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.889 
is the best in the world because it's a
bit<00:01:21.830> naughty<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.849> doesn't<00:01:23.240> take<00:01:23.420> itself<00:01:23.630> too

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
bit naughty it doesn't take itself too
