00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.699 

in<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.570> past<00:00:00.810> I've<00:00:01.020> had<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> hard<00:00:01.439> time

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
in the past I've had a hard time

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.560 
in the past I've had a hard time
explaining<00:00:02.100> what<00:00:02.550> virtual<00:00:02.970> reality<00:00:03.389> actually

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
explaining what virtual reality actually

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.630 
explaining what virtual reality actually
is<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.259> how<00:00:04.650> it<00:00:04.740> works<00:00:04.920> without<00:00:05.220> dragging

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
is and how it works without dragging

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.460 
is and how it works without dragging
people<00:00:05.790> into<00:00:06.210> an<00:00:06.480> actual<00:00:06.750> virtual<00:00:07.140> reality

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
people into an actual virtual reality

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.049 
people into an actual virtual reality
environment<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.099> let<00:00:08.250> them<00:00:08.400> experience<00:00:08.820> it

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
environment to let them experience it

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.030 
environment to let them experience it
for<00:00:09.210> themselves<00:00:09.349> so<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> figured<00:00:10.710> I'd<00:00:10.830> make<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
for themselves so I figured I'd make a

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.320 
for themselves so I figured I'd make a
slideshow<00:00:11.550> explaining<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> principles

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
slideshow explaining the principles

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.480 
slideshow explaining the principles
behind<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.080> mirth<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.440> 3d<00:00:13.710> graphics<00:00:13.830> which<00:00:14.400> is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
behind the mirth of 3d graphics which is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.340 
behind the mirth of 3d graphics which is
the<00:00:14.610> backbone<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.969> virtual<00:00:15.360> reality<00:00:15.750> I'd

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the backbone of virtual reality I'd

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.990 
the backbone of virtual reality I'd
simplify<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.100> things<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.520> gloss<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:17.880> some

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
simplify some things and gloss over some

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.550 
simplify some things and gloss over some
details<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.840> would<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> gist<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
details but this would be the gist of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.980 
details but this would be the gist of
how<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.800> works<00:00:20.029> to<00:00:21.029> understand<00:00:21.570> virtual

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
how it works to understand virtual

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
how it works to understand virtual

vision<00:00:24.119> humans<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.900> two<00:00:25.050> eyes<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> reason

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
vision humans have two eyes for a reason

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.160 
vision humans have two eyes for a reason
and<00:00:26.070> here's<00:00:26.340> why<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.449> keep<00:00:27.660> things<00:00:27.960> simple

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
and here's why to keep things simple

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.050 
and here's why to keep things simple
let's<00:00:28.529> use<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> diagram<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.699> bird's<00:00:29.910> eye

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
let's use a diagram from a bird's eye

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.030 
let's use a diagram from a bird's eye
view<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> Left<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.199> viewer<00:00:31.529> Ellis

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
view on the Left we have a viewer Ellis

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.100 
view on the Left we have a viewer Ellis
shown<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.059> her<00:00:33.149> two<00:00:33.300> eyeballs<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.810 
shown as just her two eyeballs in the
center<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> real<00:00:35.070> 3d<00:00:35.370> object

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
center we have a real 3d object

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.790 
center we have a real 3d object
Yellowstone<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.690> arrow<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> could

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
Yellowstone as an arrow but this could

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
Yellowstone as an arrow but this could
be<00:00:37.920> any<00:00:38.070> real<00:00:38.309> objects<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.000> rubik's<00:00:39.570> cube<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:40.020> a

everything<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.530> fine<00:03:01.799> Alice's<00:03:02.280> eyes<00:03:02.459> are<00:03:02.670> in

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
everything is fine Alice's eyes are in

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.039 
everything is fine Alice's eyes are in
the<00:03:02.760> right<00:03:02.970> place<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.569> virtual<00:03:03.900> object

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
the right place and the virtual object

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.110 
the right place and the virtual object
appears<00:03:04.769> at<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> exact<00:03:05.340> same<00:03:05.489> place<00:03:05.819> where

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
appears at the exact same place where

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.240 
appears at the exact same place where
the<00:03:06.239> real<00:03:06.360> object<00:03:06.750> was<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.530> now<00:03:07.680> Ellis<00:03:08.010> moves

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
the real object was but now Ellis moves

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
the real object was but now Ellis moves
her<00:03:08.400> head<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:09.150> images<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.660> screens<00:03:10.019> are

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
her head the images on the screens are

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.199 
her head the images on the screens are
still<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> same<00:03:10.799> but<00:03:11.099> now<00:03:11.280> Ellis<00:03:11.670> sees<00:03:11.940> them

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
still the same but now Ellis sees them

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.120 
still the same but now Ellis sees them
from<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.510> different<00:03:12.660> view<00:03:13.079> which<00:03:13.530> means<00:03:13.769> there

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
from a different view which means there

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.800 
from a different view which means there
are<00:03:14.160> now<00:03:14.370> different<00:03:14.610> images<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.239> her<00:03:15.329> retinas

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
are now different images on her retinas

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.470 
are now different images on her retinas
as<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.380> result<00:03:16.799> Alice's<00:03:17.400> visual<00:03:17.730> cortex<00:03:18.180> has<00:03:18.329> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
as a result Alice's visual cortex has to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.210 
as a result Alice's visual cortex has to
change<00:03:18.750> as<00:03:18.900> mental<00:03:19.230> model<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.069> only

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
change as mental model and the only

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.039 
change as mental model and the only
model<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:20.850> consistent<00:03:21.569> with<00:03:21.630> what<00:03:21.900> she

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
model that's consistent with what she

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.379 
model that's consistent with what she
sees<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.769> new<00:03:22.920> different<00:03:23.280> virtual<00:03:23.970> object

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
sees is the new different virtual object

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.330 
sees is the new different virtual object
if<00:03:24.959> she<00:03:25.200> now<00:03:25.350> moves<00:03:25.590> somewhere<00:03:25.829> else

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
if she now moves somewhere else

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.190 
if she now moves somewhere else
the<00:03:26.459> same<00:03:26.700> thing<00:03:26.910> happens<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.930> means

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the same thing happens this means

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.349 
the same thing happens this means
whenever<00:03:28.650> Alice<00:03:29.160> moves<00:03:29.430> her<00:03:29.579> head<00:03:29.790> she

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
whenever Alice moves her head she

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.210 
whenever Alice moves her head she
perceives<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.900> slight<00:03:31.139> change<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.799> virtual

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
perceives a slight change in the virtual

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.069 
perceives a slight change in the virtual
object<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.760> may<00:03:32.910> move<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.450> may<00:03:33.569> shrink<00:03:33.780> or<00:03:34.049> grow

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
object it may move it may shrink or grow

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.559 
object it may move it may shrink or grow
or<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.650> distorted<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.280> weird<00:03:35.489> ways<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:36.389> real

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
or get distorted in weird ways but real

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.150 
or get distorted in weird ways but real
objects<00:03:37.079> don't<00:03:37.200> behave<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.950> so

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
objects don't behave like that so

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.860 
objects don't behave like that so
Alice's<00:03:38.549> visual<00:03:38.850> cortex<00:03:39.299> throws<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.720> its

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
Alice's visual cortex throws up its

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.990 
Alice's visual cortex throws up its
hands<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.319> gives<00:03:40.500> up<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.859> her<00:03:41.400> perception<00:03:41.880> of

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
hands and gives up and her perception of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.759 
hands and gives up and her perception of
the<00:03:42.120> virtual<00:03:42.450> object<00:03:42.780> breaks<00:03:42.930> down<00:03:43.230> oh<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
the virtual object breaks down oh and

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.190 
the virtual object breaks down oh and
she<00:03:44.010> might<00:03:44.160> get<00:03:44.340> dizzy<00:03:44.549> -<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.510> bottom<00:03:45.810> line<00:03:45.840> is

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
she might get dizzy - the bottom line is

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.140 
she might get dizzy - the bottom line is
that<00:03:46.230> stereoscopic<00:03:47.010> display<00:03:47.400> by<00:03:47.549> itself<00:03:47.910> is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
that stereoscopic display by itself is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.970 
that stereoscopic display by itself is
not<00:03:48.180> sufficient<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.900> create<00:03:49.079> virtual<00:03:49.590> reality

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
not sufficient to create virtual reality

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.250 
not sufficient to create virtual reality
ie<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.910> illusion<00:03:51.359> of<00:03:51.510> virtual<00:03:51.870> objects

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
ie the illusion of virtual objects

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.379 
ie the illusion of virtual objects
appearing<00:03:52.680> real<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:53.370> fix<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:53.760> problem<00:03:53.970> we

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
appearing real to fix this problem we

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.089 
appearing real to fix this problem we
need<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.540> tell<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.930> computer<00:03:55.200> exactly<00:03:55.470> where

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
need to tell the computer exactly where

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.920 
need to tell the computer exactly where
Alice's<00:03:56.549> head<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.910> at<00:03:57.030> all<00:03:57.150> times<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.780> is

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
Alice's head is at all times this is

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.360 
Alice's head is at all times this is
called<00:03:58.139> head<00:03:58.319> tracking<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.920> getting<00:03:59.250> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
called head tracking and getting it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.190 
called head tracking and getting it
right<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.790> another<00:04:00.060> huge<00:04:00.359> technical<00:04:00.720> problem

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
right is another huge technical problem

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.170 
right is another huge technical problem
that<00:04:01.349> I'll<00:04:01.470> skip<00:04:01.680> over<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.519> if<00:04:02.639> you<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.910> get<00:04:03.030> it

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
that I'll skip over but if you do get it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.180 
that I'll skip over but if you do get it
right<00:04:03.359> this<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.780> what<00:04:03.930> happens<00:04:04.319> Alice<00:04:04.950> moves

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
right this is what happens Alice moves

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.979 
right this is what happens Alice moves
her<00:04:05.340> head<00:04:05.489> again<00:04:05.819> but<00:04:06.030> now<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.239> computer<00:04:06.840> is

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
her head again but now the computer is

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.659 
her head again but now the computer is
aware<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.859> knows<00:04:08.040> exactly<00:04:08.310> where

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
aware of that and knows exactly where

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.729 
aware of that and knows exactly where
her<00:04:08.760> eyes<00:04:08.940> are<00:04:09.209> using<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.079> information<00:04:10.650> it

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
her eyes are using that information it

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.500 
her eyes are using that information it
can<00:04:10.889> project<00:04:11.069> images<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:11.940> real<00:04:12.090> object

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
can project images of the real object

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.360 
can project images of the real object
from<00:04:12.660> Alice's<00:04:13.049> new<00:04:13.200> point<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.590> view<00:04:13.709> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
from Alice's new point of view the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.949 
from Alice's new point of view the
images<00:04:14.760> on<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.910> screens<00:04:15.299> will<00:04:15.540> be<00:04:15.630> different

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
images on the screens will be different

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.539 
images on the screens will be different
from<00:04:16.049> before<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:16.620> Alice<00:04:16.950> doesn't<00:04:17.160> notice

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
from before but Alice doesn't notice

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.890 
from before but Alice doesn't notice
that<00:04:17.729> because<00:04:18.090> she<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.359> not<00:04:18.510> actually

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
that because she is not actually

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.630 
that because she is not actually
perceiving<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.590> images<00:04:19.890> on<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.010> screens<00:04:20.400> but

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
perceiving the images on the screens but

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.500 
perceiving the images on the screens but
the<00:04:20.789> virtual<00:04:21.090> object<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.630> they<00:04:21.780> form

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
the virtual object that they form

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.270 
the virtual object that they form
her<00:04:22.570> visual<00:04:22.930> cortex<00:04:23.350> constructs<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.920> mental

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
her visual cortex constructs a mental

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.100 
her visual cortex constructs a mental
model<00:04:24.400> based<00:04:24.730> on<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:24.940> new<00:04:25.150> images<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.810> lo<00:04:25.990> and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
model based on the new images and lo and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.260 
model based on the new images and lo and
behold<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.920> will<00:04:27.130> be<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.340> exact<00:04:27.700> same<00:04:27.760> mental

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
behold it will be the exact same mental

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.330 
behold it will be the exact same mental
model<00:04:28.540> as<00:04:28.630> before<00:04:29.020> while<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.830> images<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
real object in interact with it that way

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.380 
real object in interact with it that way
and<00:04:55.810> that's<00:04:56.560> how<00:04:56.680> virtual<00:04:57.130> reality<00:04:57.430> works<00:04:57.640> the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
and that's how virtual reality works the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.730 
and that's how virtual reality works the
benefit<00:04:58.810> is<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:58.960> it<00:04:59.230> can<00:04:59.380> be<00:04:59.410> used<00:04:59.620> to

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
benefit is that it can be used to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.620 
benefit is that it can be used to
present<00:04:59.980> computer-generated<00:05:00.730> objects<00:05:01.480> and

users<00:05:01.840> can<00:05:02.050> perceive<00:05:02.440> them<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.890> interact

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
users can perceive them and interact

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.250 
users can perceive them and interact
with<00:05:03.340> them<00:05:03.610> as<00:05:03.790> if<00:05:03.940> they<00:05:04.060> were<00:05:04.090> real<00:05:04.390> they<00:05:05.080> can
