going down on the hole with our
proprietary<00:00:21.240> resin<00:00:21.960> that's<00:00:22.230> manufactured

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
proprietary resin that's manufactured

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.279

into<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> hole<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.039> fiberglass<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.330> put

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
into the hole with fiberglass and we put

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
into the hole with fiberglass and we put
that<00:00:27.689> person<00:00:28.080> laminate<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> hole<00:00:28.980> then<00:00:29.670> we

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that person laminate in the hole then we

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
that person laminate in the hole then we
come<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.060> behind<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.630> first<00:00:30.810> laminate<00:00:31.410> with

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
come in behind that first laminate with

come in behind that first laminate with
24<00:00:31.980> ounce<00:00:32.189> Roben<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.480> woven<00:00:33.750> roving

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
24 ounce Roben we like woven roving

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.680 
24 ounce Roben we like woven roving
because<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> mixed<00:00:35.820> product<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.540> all

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
because it's a mixed product it's all

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
because it's a mixed product it's all
integrated<00:00:37.230> basically<00:00:37.890> feathering<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> in

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
integrated basically feathering it in

laminate is cured we come back in with a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.779 
laminate is cured we come back in with a
second<00:00:46.170> laminate<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> second
