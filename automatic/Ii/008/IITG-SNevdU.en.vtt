got illustrations in the presented in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.219 
got illustrations in the presented in
different<00:01:07.429> ways<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:08.600> not<00:01:08.929> you<00:01:09.080> don't

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
different ways so it's not you don't

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.609 
different ways so it's not you don't
feel<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:09.950> you're<00:01:10.280> you're<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> slave<00:01:11.479> to

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
feel like you're you're a slave to

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.010 
feel like you're you're a slave to
reading<00:01:12.619> for<00:01:12.979> whatever<00:01:13.300> level<00:01:14.300> shows<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.869> the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
reading for whatever level shows you the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.160 
reading for whatever level shows you the
reason<00:01:15.440> that<00:01:16.060> they<00:01:17.060> were<00:01:17.119> reading<00:01:17.420> different

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
reason that they were reading different

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.169 
reason that they were reading different
types<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.830> sex<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:19.369> mean<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.580> think<00:01:19.640> that<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.030> an

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
types of sex I mean I think that is an

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.120 
types of sex I mean I think that is an
advantage<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.899> big<00:01:21.050> cat<00:01:21.289> because<00:01:21.590> you

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
advantage of the big cat because you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.580 
advantage of the big cat because you
pick<00:01:22.789> up<00:01:22.970> two<00:01:23.179> books<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.660> they<00:01:23.780> are<00:01:23.929> different

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
pick up two books and they are different

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.260 
pick up two books and they are different
they're<00:01:24.739> very<00:01:24.890> different<00:01:25.369> if<00:01:25.489> you<00:01:25.610> size<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.030> in

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
they're very different if you size it in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.660 
they're very different if you size it in
more<00:01:26.539> ways<00:01:26.750> than<00:01:26.810> one<00:01:27.349> it's<00:01:28.160> not<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:28.550> gonna

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
more ways than one it's not just gonna

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.820 
more ways than one it's not just gonna
sit<00:01:28.910> in<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.119> room<00:01:29.239> that<00:01:29.840> ta<00:01:30.110> goes<00:01:30.500> into

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
sit in that room that ta goes into

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.740 
sit in that room that ta goes into
actually<00:01:31.039> their<00:01:31.759> books<00:01:32.000> there<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.630> be

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
actually their books there that can be

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.169 
actually their books there that can be
used<00:01:33.020> for<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.099> literacy<00:01:34.459> lesson<00:01:35.000> when<00:01:35.149> you
