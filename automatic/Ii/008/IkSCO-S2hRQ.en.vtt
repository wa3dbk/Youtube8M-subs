opponent about knockdown comes back with
a<00:02:29.840> strong<00:02:30.140> rally<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.100> put<00:02:31.340> them<00:02:31.489> to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
a strong rally and which put them to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
rule Harold but i also think we ought to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.479 
rule Harold but i also think we ought to
use<00:02:37.910> common<00:02:38.420> sense<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:39.980> we<00:02:40.160> have<00:02:40.310> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
use common sense and that if we have the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.740 
use common sense and that if we have the
advantage<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.209> seeing<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.770> replay<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:44.600> ought

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
advantage of seeing the replay we ought

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.630 
advantage of seeing the replay we ought
to<00:02:44.840> apply<00:02:45.140> some<00:02:45.590> common<00:02:45.769> sense<00:02:46.160> yeah<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.519> how

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
to apply some common sense yeah but how

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.710 
to apply some common sense yeah but how

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
it's trying to do it the way the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.900 
it's trying to do it the way the
official<00:02:47.810> judges<00:02:48.650> would<00:02:48.830> do<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.190> Larry<00:02:49.430> right
