00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.319
 the island of the moon proves its mysterious silhouette 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.319
 for example on one side that precious 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.609
 sailing about 3800 meters high 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.079

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 because this majestic white week without time and it is important to ask permission 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 once we enter the temple we will go to the source is sacred of the water 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.090
 packaging I think the water permanently so far but that 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.470
 they are from the water and then we leave ad with a broken voice 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.080
 deny ourselves to whom the people in the meantime to our team 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.420
 it's a reconnection with the source 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.390
 here the girl started for us to be totally done in Madrid 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.039
 percent and consists of two sides a lake mall a lake 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.710
 at the moment that a form of stimulus at no time formally 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.990
 hong kong ha ha 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.610
 assumption sea 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.200
 very simple and a lot of humor apodaca 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.380
 10% sun effect clemens nelson prevails 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.470
 a different way in this place 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.390
 for us this sacred lake 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.730
 it will be the next four deep messages of life 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.910
 many of us are a nation 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.220
 because they will connect with the dawn 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.960
 9 - with all this in the generation of new secrets and mysteries for 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.630
 confirm your sacred temples 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.080
 also the secrets of agriculture 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 and of rural development and with nature 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.729
 the so-called labyrinth 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.569
 the most visited temple on the island of the sun 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.060
 the stone walls keep their secrets 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.189
 invite to know the Andean culture services 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.189
 thus helping the economy of the islanders 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.599
 all that was completely alone 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.599
 healthy moments collapsed 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:31.639
 so 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.249
 this is higher 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.789
 obviously that 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.119
 what is pushing you have here 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.959
 because it's like dead-end street as this one had nothing that is on the road 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.599
 on that side then how is 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.599
 in fact the property 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.419
 and through the correct ones 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.819
 the slope of the hillside nothing 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.009
 the deficit is near 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.009
 alonso that is 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:13.889
 the stone paths leads us from the south side to this north side of the island 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.679
 gift of the temple of the sun and cocaine 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.679
 impresses travelers of all times 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.859
 It was in these series that the Tiahuanacota culture flourished 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.789
 that gave rise to the Incas 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.939
 heirs of an agricultural and textile wisdom 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.779
 tiwanaku was the center in which it is inscribed in the central stone 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.930
 that continues amazonía that agglutinated the Andes that he 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.809
 acosta 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:46.180
 everything is concentrated 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.569
 in tinaco 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.049
 every team has its cycles 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.059
 resignation 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.089
 in a circular way the day 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.219
 and at night 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.839
 and ended montilla 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.839
 the time the helmsman 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.539
 tiwanaku 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:13.669
 starting a few months at 150 after Christ as his consumption 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.769
 a woman in global climate change fair 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.490
 efe - the Colombian striker as 20 years 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.570
 then it is understood that the one who was involved as a politician on duty 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.260
 this ruling elite disappears leaving the Naco club 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:32.759
 They have to go 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.699
 nor will he forget 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.320
 where the conditions for 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.960
 to survive 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.860
 and to the best of itself in that sense we are talking about copacabana matute the 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.960
 island of luzón 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.710
 don tony allen of the quintile if the currency possibilities something 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.650
 as it matches 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.249
 It is very difficult 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.249
 and the incario again was decidedly like few 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.300
 and also riding 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.419
 as if they had been sent a mission 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.909
 to go back to being the second request the one that Monaco 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.979
 I ask everyone that some players feel the un 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.509
 they do not tell us 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.120
 that arrived a week from a grand slam agassi 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.819
 civil society 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.990
 they would found 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.089
 Thus 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.509
 for 15 days in court 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:23.819
 at &amp; t inc 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.599
 here at home the lacerant 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.589
 and therefore they saved the sacred seeds and one of the seeds very 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:32.589
 important 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.850
 therefore the culture of peace in our latitudes so well 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.610
 they do not exist 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.879
 hard 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.639
 this labor and technological tradition that made possible the formation of 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.039
 elites service 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.810
 endure from the heart of the people of titicaca giving cultivated foods a 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.809
 spiritual dimension 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.599
 we are children of the mother who is 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.429
 everything that exists is so that both of them therefore deserve respect 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.589
 29% of the EU still maintains its purity 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.469
 the 1% of contamination that presents 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.990
 by the growth and lack of sanitation of the populations that 

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:12.180
 surround 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.389
 it could extend its waters 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.409
 it's a dumpster for some 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.240
 I would like unions for many
