00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.300
 nothing I want to send a solicitous to all 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.620
 the people who are watching the video 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.350
 right now that really is appreciated 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.059
 very good as you are seeing in the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.800
 title of the title will be called thinking 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.109
 it's something like that I would simply like this 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.600
 video just to do it from what 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.359
 Yesterday it happened more or less how I feel 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.679
 and what do I think about things not then not 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.840
 it's going to be a very long video I hope that 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.450
 can you understand it is going to be a video 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.729
 expressing myself and that's it 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.520
 you want to hear it you listen if you want 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.890
 I support what you support or am 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.039
 better calling and well then the case 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.229
 was that yesterday he did not go to the event like me 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.479
 I expected not simply because it went wrong 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.069
 we did not expect him to see so many 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.000
 people at the time of the event is something 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.990
 I did not expect 800 people 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.049
 will try to enter inside a server 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.299
 and I did not expect it, so I had some 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.740
 500 people about 500 about 400 people 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.979
 I wanted to go there not eight hundred 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.380
 people and even more who could not and 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.959
 well it was not possible to carry out the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.929
 event this is not so much so then 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:50.770
 can receive but many insults 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.539
 that is, from 10 a.m. to one o'clock and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.640
 something of the dawn is and I had some 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.220
 10,000 interactions on twitter based 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 of insults much of the great majority of 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.090
 the people who supported or supported what 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.369
 happened saying that nothing has happened 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.679
 any failure has anyone not 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.709
 but to me now I am not a person not 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.509
 that I face the criticisms I do not know I'm 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.540
 very sensitive is not to say it affects me 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.500
 anything not from the criticisms and it was 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.720
 as in flanders 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.400
 I could not do it, I could not, this is 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.140
 my fault even if it was not my fault 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.450
 but I already think it's my fault that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.630
 is something for when it could not be for 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.620
 misael yes because I do not know I do not know how 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.660
 explain it on how I feel not 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.400
 you can really thank very much the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 support not because it was one of the things by 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.520
 which then I did not get a 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.980
 smile at night not because it is that 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.060
 I do not know that big amount of insults 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.220
 because if not because it's something that they do not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.720
 they have not even spent money on that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.330
 they have spent nothing they have not spent their 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 time to prepare everything even 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.970
 they have also done old twitter 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.180
 there was antich antillon and I do not know I do not know by 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.730
 what does not come to my mind? 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.209
 they are deleted they are recreated 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.980
 I do not know why I do not really know 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.000
 I expected it to come out so the only thing 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.750
 what we have done has simply been 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.750
 hug him 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.050
 and that's no longer saying how I feel and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.460
 as said the more you give the less 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.920
 banana as in communities where 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.390
 simply many people think of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.300
 themselves that I am also a person 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.770
 it's not me too I was the river scream 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.530
 I knew something of everything I have even 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.080
 feelings no I'm not a damn point 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.260
 the robot knows 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.730
 I do not know if you understand what I'm trying 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.770
 say then this video is not going to be 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.050
 very long because the only thing I try is 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.850
 that you enter a little bit because of what 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.190
 it happened that I'm not to blame for 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.950
 which has thus been left that has 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.770
 the guilt basically nobody because no 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.090
 server is able to accept so many 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.700
 people of gaulle less even hi 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.050
 pixels a month ago he also had a 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.740
 similar problem they were doing 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.690
 an event and I do not know if it was 800 or a thousand 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.510
 people were entering and had 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.910
 than adding more servers because it happened 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.400
 the same thing that was not falling and could not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.160
 take a very long time a lot of time 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.350
 in getting it then I do not know then 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.360
 I make this video simply because of that 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.190
 ask for forgiveness also in the week that 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.890
 It is going to be again the event and such 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.989
 but that you understand it but also a 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.640
 little commented so a little weird is not but 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.250
 as animated as always simply by 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.480
 the fact of yesterday then he has 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.480
 said many thanks to all 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.310
 seen the video if you can understand and 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.500
 nothing if you want to leave a habit of 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.300
 up then leave it like yesterday I said yes 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.420
 you want to leave a title because you leave it and 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.560
 you are already not able to do anything no 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.970
 right now 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.290
 now a lot of people who hate me 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.810
 but a lot of people for the simple 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.450
 Failure to give an account not nothing 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.860
