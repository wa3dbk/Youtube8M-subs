heavy-duty
heavy-duty<00:01:52.380> adjustment<00:01:54.680> mechanisms<00:01:55.680> for

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
heavy-duty adjustment mechanisms for

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:30.170 
heavy-duty adjustment mechanisms for
tilt<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.369> anything<00:01:56.550> like<00:01:56.759> that<00:02:28.880> where<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.000> can

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
tilt or anything like that where you can

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
don't have to take no more tape on the

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.160 
don't have to take no more tape on the
bottom<00:02:42.560> head<00:02:42.980> yay

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the lock mechanism right there I'm

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.560 
the lock mechanism right there I'm
awesome<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.169> when<00:03:33.349> you<00:03:33.439> stick<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.799> on

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
and I like this the internal internal

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.140 
and I like this the internal internal
lags<00:03:41.240> here<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.490> that<00:03:43.490> is<00:03:43.520> definitely

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
lags here that is a that is definitely

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.960 
lags here that is a that is definitely
nice<00:03:44.330> so<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.890> can<00:03:46.040> turn<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:46.340> with<00:03:46.550> your<00:03:46.700> hand

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970
