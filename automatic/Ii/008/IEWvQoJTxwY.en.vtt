00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
to change the situation firstly if there

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.360 
to change the situation firstly if there
are<00:05:18.599> still<00:05:18.810> so<00:05:19.080> many<00:05:19.139> residential<00:05:19.770> buildings

be sold

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.310

perhaps<00:05:24.210> we<00:05:24.479> could<00:05:24.659> rent<00:05:24.870> out<00:05:25.080> these

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
perhaps we could rent out these

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.040 
perhaps we could rent out these
buildings<00:05:25.830> which<00:05:26.699> are<00:05:26.880> empty<00:05:27.000> for<00:05:27.419> more<00:05:27.870> than

six months two tenants at the same time

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.529 
six months two tenants at the same time
this<00:05:32.099> would<00:05:32.310> cut<00:05:32.520> down<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.940> stress<00:05:33.270> of<00:05:33.300> the

this would cut down the stress of the

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.899 
this would cut down the stress of the
real<00:05:33.720> estate<00:05:33.870> market<00:05:34.099> so<00:05:35.099> we<00:05:35.280> keep<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.729> high

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909

prices when substantial price cuts are
not<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.370> wise<00:05:38.669> move<00:05:39.560> secondly<00:05:40.560> we<00:05:41.400> should<00:05:41.580> not

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
not a wise move secondly we should not
