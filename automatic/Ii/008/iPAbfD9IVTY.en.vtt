00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello people at the next champion 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.240
 spotlight This time I left you 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.050
 present 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.540
 I sin the sin and I show you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.679
 first briefly the mods and then come 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.679
 we to the 12th 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.350
 there you can at least and the passports 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.909
 is always excited when i get one 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.440
 champion or tower 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.880
 if one falls into the attack 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.909
 so last three four seconds war 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 mega 505 70 percent I can do that now 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:21.720
 do not demonstrate unless I want to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 my belonged crew is switcher 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.500
 the weapon has changed them 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:36.280
 on the one hand here the minigun always 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:39.159
 again gives more text and also halt 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.800
 depending on how many times had and then 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.569
 stop the rocket launcher of the weir 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.240
 on the other hand, it pushes the problem 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:51.220
 that he trusted painter so to speak 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.069
 like the Cubans and never does otherwise 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.770
 hurt and has just 150 range more me 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.770
 just say that with the median 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 Since he has already provided the text and 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.379
 then rocket launcher pretty cool thing 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 I like it very much then next 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:19.209
 we have the sap and it has one 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.260
 quite a long range of marks 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.730
 namely the opponents around here 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.319
 so you can see here shoots 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.660
 so to speak, in a line, we just 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.459
 You saw here settled beer and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.760
 then mark the opponents even if 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.330
 they are unsure what de sets 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.280
 so to speak 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.050
 so fall open and get hold only 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.319
 briefly where it is on some 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.250
 harm and then we come to that 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.500
 hottest of all 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.730
 I think I'm not sure you 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.290
 are you allowed to have comments ? 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.530
 i believe i and ii goes over the the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.909
 whole web but I find myself on everyone 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.909
 Finally, a rocket case mega 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.300
 yes you will see it always needs 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.620
 the more harm the further it flies 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.300
 after only about the first second 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.070
 and does physical damage 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.360
 how to read, I can show them 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.800
 always nice the tooltips so he himself 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.260
 read through it because I think I can 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.310
 also partially full extent could 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.350
 do not rely on what I say 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.980
 and I thought my we and you are standing 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.980
 you really will not 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:48.549
 yes and i would say okay we killed 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.430
 that's a little bit of air I just go 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.890
 Wait a minute for everyone he can 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 namely the skin matthew james 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.439
 imagine because come out with us 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.659
 directly at release if i have a short one 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.769
 personal conclusion should say so me 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.459
 like the champion so far very well 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.319
 it's kind of like that already 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.709
 I got used to it for a while 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.409
 known before 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.409
 and then shows first go 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.880
 early in January 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
 Berlin 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.220
 Fri. 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.000
 the way free is always awesome 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:39.510
 he had just seen it 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.310
 This may have my way then offered 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:50.540
 Actually she did it fast 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:50.540
 the world will rise then I think 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.340
 mainz 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.919
 and now can inter zloty and about the 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:57.220
 where she wrote all the poems I have 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.220
 tested 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.530
 I would say that we went was he would 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.860
 That's why this goal is shown 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.860
 but now thanks to christoph gusy
