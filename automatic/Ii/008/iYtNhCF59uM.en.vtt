00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, we are cuirassiers 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.849
 continue to pass your cards which 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.950
 send me to the VKontakte group so 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.740
 well , we usually have a rule here now 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.010
 jump such a card or cuirassier 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.699
 those rules you can cheat reached terminal strip 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.300
 you can okay and break the blocks to play 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 peace maker Pokey Master 123 where 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.599
 wenge team in the interior is already a goal parkour 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.020
 and this is probably the modes that we have here 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 finish okay well then let's get started 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.840
 the very first from parkour my as me 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.770
 interesting here pulled a checkpoint pinches 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.110
 Okay, let's try to go through this parkmaster 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.340
 read head somehow tall for me 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 it seemed were well I didn't just jump 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.020
 just took took and didn't jump a little 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.660
 checkpoint here is 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.320
 hell the best was in the center where 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.350
 guys have every parses here 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 so let's try to go through it all 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.229
 so here quickly so here it is 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.040
 itâ€™s easy 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.240
 It seems to be like this about complex traits 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.250
 wanted to jump not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.630
 did not notice that there they are too close 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.790
 are each other okay okay again 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 let's go through the only stairs 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:39.770
 they spend a lot of time let's get here 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.770
 put a boy he was let's restart 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:52.730
 point will be fine now resurrected 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:58.020
 when you fall great yes what the fuck 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:03.210
 such a contrast me emotions great then 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:08.520
 what the fuck cuis we will fly excellent 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.610
 Oh, in principle, just fine enough 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.660
 it chest Ukhta helmet look super 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.880
 a helmet for cuirassier 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.660
 so this test passed those not tyrant 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.300
 uneasy what's so complicated about it 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.110
 checkpoint use is not easy 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.520
 tinker you need to find the right door 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.690
 if not the first time you went there 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.130
 science and let's go kidding here 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.910
 need a door what we need door 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.340
 maybe here it seems to me probably 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.100
 that the right door is or here it is 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.700
 there is still some kind of second door or here 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.150
 this let's try this one why i 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 immediately fell down it was unfair to me 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.610
 block eat ok let's try some more 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 once about 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.420
 i need a great door but i just 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.580
 saw that here on their big 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.230
 more space than others 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.890
 places let's check what was there 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:18.120
 just interesting for fun let's see 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:20.930
 what we have here is empty what we have here m 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.930
 too empty 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.610
 on here, too, nothing but in principle 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.730
 Okay , then these cells are cut. 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.350
 here lie so spawn des took from us here 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.870
 one more moves on the other side as 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.420
 once the length dropped really scary not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.270
 I thought it was such a fuck that I 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.540
 I can see this door from here 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.130
 ineffably pass here then it is rather 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.900
 just exactly the kind of door in which 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.110
 I would hit if I went to the selection 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.959
 kryushka so bib super bib 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.220
 for cuirassier 2 test passed 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.440
 the maze 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.110
 wow, by the way, such a wide aisle here 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.160
 yes fun because usually everything 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.660
 make pass narrow here there too 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.800
 there are narrow pass at the beginning they 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.530
 were wide it was cool so 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.060
 okay one side checked even two 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:20.590
 the parties probably all the same it is yes it is 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.130
 quite easy maze so super 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.700
 super shrink sulfur times that we have 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.540
 farther 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.470
 searching polish hens or pigs bringing something 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.390
 we are not here find a chest with a lever and 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.270
 put wool on blue better 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.880
 and this is here animals let's have fun these 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.390
 animals on here still put the skates 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.040
 i hear there is some quick pick 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.570
 shovel I hear there mobs somewhere 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.400
 oh you her we can fall through here 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.100
 it turns out we will start very fast 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.050
 so we will carefully dig in 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.080
 here everything is really awesome 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.260
 that gave such a quick perk to me i would 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.250
 You can not particularly soared just take and 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.250
 dig through 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:18.069
 so all the animal world start to fall here 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:25.779
 already they are obtained let's 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:31.199
 check where where can be a chest about 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:34.199
 chest lever and super shoe cuirassier 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.180
 so let's get here now 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.849
 lever up to 7 wool and cent 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.949
 shovels almost broke but I think 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.259
 pigs need it so let's leave 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:48.849
 her here and take the lever all 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.870
 a rollercoaster ride went on 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.300
 creeper 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.300
 could let us on the posts described 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:05.439
 deficiency describes 1. here is the thread 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.379
 we just don't want to be able to 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:13.360
 here exploded me a map therefore and 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:16.229
 put wrote f passing in the newspaper barely 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.889
 barely barely why is she so visible rides 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:26.319
 it is not clear here that's all these cool 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:28.749
 The card deserves Pyaterochka 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:33.729
 the tests here are pretty spawn 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:37.209
 There is a variety of plus what I am 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:41.370
 dug it here side was a pickaxe 

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:46.419
 gave a good who quickly things we 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.520
 destroys so very nicely I 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:54.590
 I think 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.310
 so down to the descent here the village with 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.669
 residents 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.120
 I have somewhere then a bat 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:05.360
 Apparently this bat so hope they 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.729
 I'll fall off fine this bat rather 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.580
 total home spawn like those slides 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.460
 cool wow you are super rod terrace 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.060
 distinguishable rod 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:22.580
 resident and will reset 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:23.330
 so dude finish what us so well 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.280
 you card 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.599
 Of course, 5 is definitely Pyaterochka 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:35.509
 even put more points that is it 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:37.759
 it turns out we have 15 points 15 points here 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:40.340
 so here is over the points of this map and put 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:42.820
 Well, I just liked the cool 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:46.400
 the card has become qualitatively interesting 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.750
 test a lot of different here in principle on 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.639
 thank you all for all of this 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.090
