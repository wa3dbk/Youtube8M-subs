00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can get up in the sensor that's no good

can get up in the sensor that's no good
some<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> cameras<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.420> automated

some of the cameras have automated
sensor<00:01:07.260> cleaning<00:01:07.500> tools<00:01:08.479> they<00:01:09.479> work<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sensor cleaning tools they work but you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.870 
sensor cleaning tools they work but you
know<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.950> may<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.369> always<00:01:11.610> work<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
know they may not always work so if you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.160 
know they may not always work so if you
can't<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> piece<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.540> dust<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.140> your

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
can't get a piece of dust off your

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
can't get a piece of dust off your
sensor<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> little

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
sensor there's going to be a little

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.190 
sensor there's going to be a little
brown<00:01:18.290> dot<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:20.250> multiple<00:01:21.000> pixels<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.990> your

brown dot of multiple pixels on your

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.910 
brown dot of multiple pixels on your
images<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:24.630> annoying<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.590> fixable

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
images it's annoying but it's fixable

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.700 
images it's annoying but it's fixable
but<00:01:26.520> I'd<00:01:26.790> rather<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.119> spend<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:27.750> fixing

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
but I'd rather not spend the time fixing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.450 
but I'd rather not spend the time fixing
little<00:01:29.130> dots<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:30.259> so<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
little dots right so you can use this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.039 
little dots right so you can use this
type<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> blower<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.220> open<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.490> your<00:01:35.549> lens

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
type of blower to you open up your lens

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
type of blower to you open up your lens
take<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.170> lens<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.500> rather<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
take your lens off rather going to the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.780 
take your lens off rather going to the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
sensor cleaning setting at intend to put

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.139 
sensor cleaning setting at intend to put
the<00:01:41.939> camera<00:01:42.240> upside<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.460> sensor

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the camera upside down so the sensor

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.870 
the camera upside down so the sensor
facing<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
facing down you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.200 
facing down you
blow<00:01:47.119> up<00:01:47.390> into<00:01:47.719> it<00:01:48.079> like<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.030> this<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.180> a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
blow up into it like this and this is a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.899 
blow up into it like this and this is a
very<00:01:50.450> powerful<00:01:51.039> tool<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.369> don't<00:01:52.549> want<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.789> use

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
very powerful tool you don't want to use

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.779 
very powerful tool you don't want to use
any<00:01:52.939> compressed<00:01:53.600> air<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:55.159> your<00:01:55.189> camera<00:01:55.640> that

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
any compressed air in your camera that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.670 
any compressed air in your camera that
would<00:01:55.909> be<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.180> bad<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:57.259> this<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.649> just

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
would be really bad but this is just

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.219 
would be really bad but this is just
clean<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.759> know<00:01:58.880> manual<00:01:59.360> air<00:01:59.689> it<00:02:00.020> kind<00:02:00.200> of

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
clean you know manual air it kind of

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.919 
clean you know manual air it kind of
sucks<00:02:00.439> it<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.679> from<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.920> bottom<00:02:01.100> down<00:02:01.429> here

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
sucks it in from the bottom down here

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.830 
sucks it in from the bottom down here
was<00:02:02.929> about<00:02:03.140> here<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.149> it's<00:02:05.149> a<00:02:05.270> good<00:02:05.390> tool<00:02:05.689> to

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
was about here and it's a good tool to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.979 
was about here and it's a good tool to
have<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.350> clean<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.740> dust<00:02:07.069> grime<00:02:07.460> dirt<00:02:07.989> mainly

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
have to clean out dust grime dirt mainly

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.190 
have to clean out dust grime dirt mainly
dust<00:02:09.200> from<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.440> sensors<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:12.080> is

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
dust from the sensors for you this is

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.910 
dust from the sensors for you this is
like<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.349> first<00:02:12.739> step<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.849> do<00:02:14.890> before<00:02:15.890> you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
like a first step to do before you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920 
like a first step to do before you
actually<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.550> touch<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.239> sensor<00:02:17.660> with

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
actually have to touch the sensor with

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.410 
actually have to touch the sensor with
anything<00:02:18.349> which<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.980> don't<00:02:19.790> ever<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.269> do

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
anything which I don't ever want to do

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.539 
anything which I don't ever want to do
but<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.049> know<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.349> your<00:02:21.799> cleaning<00:02:22.130> lenses

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
but you know just your cleaning lenses

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.150 

where<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.690> start<00:02:32.920> putting<00:02:33.920> your

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
gear House creaking damage is certainly

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.170

that<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.349> next<00:02:48.620> step<00:02:48.860> right<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:49.940> can

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that is the next step right but you can

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.990 
that is the next step right but you can
do<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.079> want<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.350> avoid<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.280> for

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
me the best way to do that is use these

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.080 
me the best way to do that is use these
