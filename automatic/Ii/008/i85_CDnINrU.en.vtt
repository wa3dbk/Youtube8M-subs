00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:57.579 
four five six seven eight and nine and
we<00:04:49.139> skip<00:04:50.810> nine<00:04:51.810> stitches

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:57.589 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.489 

and<00:04:57.829> so<00:04:58.429> on<00:04:58.609> and<00:04:59.419> you<00:04:59.569> will<00:04:59.719> do<00:04:59.929> this<00:05:00.139> until

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:00.499 
and so on and you will do this until

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:07.719 
and so on and you will do this until
your<00:05:01.369> scarf<00:05:02.349> is<00:05:03.429> long<00:05:04.429> enough<00:05:04.969> as<00:05:05.269> you<00:05:05.539> want<00:05:06.729> if

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
your scarf is long enough as you want if

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.909 
your scarf is long enough as you want if
your<00:05:08.029> scarf<00:05:08.389> is<00:05:08.629> done<00:05:08.869> in<00:05:09.169> your<00:05:09.409> chaise<00:05:09.679> I

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
your scarf is done in your chaise I

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.819 
your scarf is done in your chaise I
hidden<00:05:10.249> then<00:05:10.789> we<00:05:10.969> can<00:05:11.179> charge<00:05:11.539> doing<00:05:12.469> the<00:05:12.589> plan

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:12.829 
hidden then we can charge doing the plan

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:17.399 
hidden then we can charge doing the plan
so<00:05:13.819> I<00:05:13.849> will<00:05:14.209> take<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.779> first<00:05:15.019> train<00:05:15.379> here<00:05:16.129> I

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
so I will take the first train here I

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.929 
so I will take the first train here I
will<00:05:18.409> twist<00:05:18.739> it<00:05:18.979> like<00:05:19.509> this<00:05:21.249> I'm<00:05:22.249> going

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
will twist it like this I'm going

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.149 
will twist it like this I'm going
through<00:05:23.299> this<00:05:23.479> loop<00:05:23.779> and<00:05:24.229> I<00:05:24.409> grab<00:05:24.799> this<00:05:25.099> the

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
through this loop and I grab this the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.699 
through this loop and I grab this the
next<00:05:25.639> trend<00:05:26.119> and<00:05:26.449> pull<00:05:26.839> it<00:05:26.959> through<00:05:26.989> this<00:05:27.469> loop

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:27.709 
next trend and pull it through this loop

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:31.149 
next trend and pull it through this loop
I<00:05:28.509> have<00:05:29.509> a<00:05:29.539> new<00:05:29.779> one<00:05:30.019> then<00:05:30.589> again<00:05:30.829> I'm<00:05:30.979> going

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
I have a new one then again I'm going

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.519 
I have a new one then again I'm going
through<00:05:31.609> this<00:05:31.789> loop<00:05:32.059> and<00:05:32.509> I<00:05:32.749> pull<00:05:33.049> the<00:05:33.199> next

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
through this loop and I pull the next

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.269 
through this loop and I pull the next
strand<00:05:33.829> through<00:05:35.739> like<00:05:36.739> this<00:05:36.919> so<00:05:37.129> it's

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
strand through like this so it's

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.049 
strand through like this so it's
actually<00:05:37.579> my<00:05:38.389> crocheting<00:05:39.579> but<00:05:40.579> without<00:05:41.029> a

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:41.059 
actually my crocheting but without a

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:45.029 
actually my crocheting but without a
crochet<00:05:41.869> hook<00:05:42.109> and<00:05:42.639> using<00:05:43.639> only<00:05:43.939> your<00:05:44.389> fingers

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
crochet hook and using only your fingers

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.079 
crochet hook and using only your fingers
like<00:05:46.039> slip<00:05:46.399> stitching<00:05:46.909> and<00:05:47.919> that's<00:05:48.919> all<00:05:49.279> what

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
like slip stitching and that's all what

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:54.999 
like slip stitching and that's all what
we<00:05:50.389> will<00:05:50.599> do<00:05:51.069> until<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:52.429> end<00:05:52.609> of<00:05:52.729> our<00:05:52.909> scarf<00:05:54.009> so

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
we will do until the end of our scarf so

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.539 
we will do until the end of our scarf so
this<00:05:55.279> is<00:05:55.459> my<00:05:55.669> scarf<00:05:56.119> at<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.869> end<00:05:57.219> and<00:05:58.219> you<00:05:58.399> can

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:58.549 
this is my scarf at the end and you can

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:01.359 
this is my scarf at the end and you can
see<00:05:58.609> a<00:05:58.819> big<00:05:59.269> loop<00:05:59.569> here<00:06:00.079> and<00:06:00.199> what<00:06:00.859> you<00:06:01.039> can<00:06:01.219> do

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:01.369 
see a big loop here and what you can do

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:03.749 
see a big loop here and what you can do
now<00:06:01.549> you<00:06:01.610> can<00:06:02.059> fix<00:06:02.329> it<00:06:02.569> so<00:06:02.809> you<00:06:02.869> can<00:06:03.199> see<00:06:03.469> this

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
now you can fix it so you can see this

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.999 
now you can fix it so you can see this
enter<00:06:04.759> your<00:06:04.939> scarf<00:06:05.329> and<00:06:05.719> it<00:06:06.139> won't<00:06:06.379> open<00:06:06.769> or

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
you leave it like this and then you can

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.769 
you leave it like this and then you can
change<00:06:09.439> your<00:06:09.679> plan<00:06:10.129> so<00:06:10.939> maybe<00:06:11.209> you<00:06:11.449> want<00:06:11.719> to

you could change it all the time so it

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.819 
you could change it all the time so it
depends<00:06:25.699> what<00:06:26.479> you<00:06:26.659> want<00:06:26.929> to<00:06:27.079> do<00:06:27.229> if<00:06:27.469> you<00:06:27.619> want
