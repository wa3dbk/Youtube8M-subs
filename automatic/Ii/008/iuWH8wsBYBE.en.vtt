00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 was a hi to all friends and welcome to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.929
 this way tutorial time behind you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.779
 I had proposed this tutorial 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.359
 double exposure made in this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.180
 way but lately seeing that it is 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.400
 a lot of people, especially if you look 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.099
 more google photos and various stuff 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.320
 I have been requested by several 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 people how to create this other type of 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.480
 double exposure exposure as 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 you can see is a layout type 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.520
 very simple that I really don't 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.450
 I would have made a tutorial though since 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.220
 I can understand that there are people who 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.250
 he is not so domesticated with this 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.690
 program and would also like them to do 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 this type of photo decided to show 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.030
 how to create this double exposure 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.100
 quite simple so very fast 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.690
 as I said before a priori long ago 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.580
 I had put up this kind of double 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.729
 exposure that is much more difficult and 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.130
 today I will show you how to create type 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.790
 of the backgrounds always the exposure as 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.580
 for example this or this as you can 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.190
 see type google plus lions will see us 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.430
 in the desert with an image in this 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.220
 I sense a little more gloomy like this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.410
 well today I explain the simplicity of 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.850
 this effect also anyway I have to 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.479
 admit it very beautiful as an impact 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.670
 visual 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.670
 so let's close all the rest 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.479
 we throw everything away and leave 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.170
 from the beginning 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.680
 in this case also this closed 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 this is what there is in this case 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.509
 let's start from our landscape that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 we would like to put it as a background and then 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.660
 what should we do we should go to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.630
 take the picture we want 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.630
 insert into our background then 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.440
 let's go get the picture in this 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.769
 chance I took this girl and I go to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.930
 take virtually the best parts 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.819
 image so first of all 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 I'll move with the move tool 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.319
 the image within the background 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.500
 so I'll take it in big apples 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.390
 roadster or based on the event that is 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.880
 how I want to put it then with against 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.110
 I recommend keeping it pressed 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.329
 I'm going to enlarge my picture later here 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.810
 it still depends on your taste 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.470
 from the photo of the background you have is one 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.609
 time I think that's enough for me that way 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.930
 I send and go to play on opacity 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.150
 of my image in this case of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.190
 this eye boy to go to 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.950
 see more or less where they will end up 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.829
 the parts I want to include in the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.430
 my image in this case the eyes 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.410
 so I see that one part really suits me 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.190
 directly on the other one goes to me 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.620
 bit on the city so with the effects of 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.890
 light and looks good for me too 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.980
 maybe I'll move this a bit here 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.739
 above this image so as to give a 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.980
 nicer effect good once I know 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.650
 that practically my image in 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.190
 this case so i like what i go to 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.090
 make a report on my opacity percent 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.610
 percent 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.010
 what do you want to do anyway 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.240
 an overlap that I'm going to do 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 so I'm going to change the method of 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.630
 then merging with the overlap method 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.040
 as you can see it will have already done me more than 50 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.410
 percent of the work I wanted 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.120
 I realize in this case it goes well 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.900
 we have a light color so it also goes 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.170
 much better 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.080
 and what will there be to do to cancel the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.910
 part that I do not want then with my own 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.100
 rubber brush a soft brush 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:24.250
 so 20 percent sorry I'll go with a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.940
 50 percent right not to weigh down 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:33.030
 too much though with the rubber 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.030
 what I am going to cancel will go to 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.580
 delete the part that I don't 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.860
 interested leaving only the part that 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.480
 I wanted to show you how I told you before 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.010
 on my pictures obviously if you have 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.360
 of the cuts so as in this case the 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.540
 deleted 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.270
 and if you want to spend maybe a little more 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.320
 close by also leaving the eyebrows 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.490
 a little more we say clear compared to 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.320
 eyes that are the ones I want to do 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.840
 maybe stand out at my low opacity 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:13.740
 step even now it specifies so and me 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.760
 I also recommend close to the eyes here 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.060
 this is the method 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:25.030
 don't worry if you see that maybe 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:27.250
 eyes are too withered we say little 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.370
 brightness for you will be enough with against the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.080
 but doubling the level but later on 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.600
 however it is up to personal taste 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.840
 I would leave it like that because it doesn't have to be a 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.030
 effect too much disposition then 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.180
 anyway I'll show you with against 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.180
 j 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.090
 the effect will be practically increased 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.180
 of the eyes and I if I see that anyway 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:57.270
 I want to light only the blue I will go to 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.270
 delete the non-interested part 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:10.499
 leaving so are the effect of 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:13.259
 eyes as I told you before anyway me 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:14.879
 I would leave a nicer effect 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.960
 according to me why it must be one 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:21.090
 nuance in the sky and therefore in the lights 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.099
 and this is all 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.810
 as I showed the same thing first 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:29.789
 we could also do with the tiger ad 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.889
 example we put here I put a 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.650
 snowy landscape as you see a 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.710
 in short, this is a very nice effect 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.250
 all very well I hope I have been there 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.719
 help 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.490
 I recommend if the tutorial is there 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.289
 liked it and it was helpful to be pleased 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.969
 if here cassi su I like it 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.909
 share the video you will help me 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:49.259
 grow up and he'll care nothing for us 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:50.759

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.629
 speedart wish you all a good one 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.629
 hello day
