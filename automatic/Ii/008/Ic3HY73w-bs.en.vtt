00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
these are big planks actually a little

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.060 
these are big planks actually a little
bit<00:02:00.340> bigger<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:02.110> should<00:02:02.290> be<00:02:02.410> for<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:02.770> bowl

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
bit bigger there should be for this bowl

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.710 
bit bigger there should be for this bowl
so<00:02:03.430> what<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.580> think<00:02:03.700> I'm<00:02:04.000> going<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.180> do<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.540> just

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
so what I think I'm going to do is just

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.630 
so what I think I'm going to do is just
lay<00:02:04.870> them<00:02:05.080> out<00:02:05.260> here<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.280> we're<00:02:09.429> going<00:02:09.580> to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
lay them out here and we're going to

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.060 
lay them out here and we're going to
make<00:02:09.790> sure<00:02:09.970> they're<00:02:10.179> covered<00:02:10.540> that<00:02:10.750> way<00:02:14.070> and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
make sure they're covered that way and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.830 
make sure they're covered that way and
then<00:02:15.490> we<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.700> drizzle<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.480> over<00:02:17.250> them<00:02:18.840> these

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
then we can drizzle this over them these

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.880 
then we can drizzle this over them these
are<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> planks<00:02:20.620> we're<00:02:20.920> going<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:22.140> cook<00:02:25.890> then

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
are the planks we're going to cook then

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.740 
are the planks we're going to cook then
take<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.370> others<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:32.280> pour<00:02:33.280> over<00:02:33.750> or

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.360 

then<00:02:42.730> flip<00:02:43.060> them<00:02:43.270> over<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.830> both<00:02:45.069> sides

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
then flip them over on both sides

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.339 
then flip them over on both sides
