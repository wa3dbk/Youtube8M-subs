00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.150
 today and the movie will be a little bit 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 shortened because because of abu dhabi 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 Enoki wolf did not have time to do as 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.330
 it is necessary but nevertheless they show two 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 new applications rather one application 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.990
 I just can't play one game for example 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.029
 There is a new tweetbot called 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 tweetbot 3 on it can't just 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 look I bought it of course if you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 I will ask to buy it or 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.850
 no worth it or not then of course i 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 I'll give it for advice to buy, especially if 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.290
 you on your iphone and ios 7 because 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 The old will not be updated new design 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 he will not have but the new year 3 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 he just looks unreal cool 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.930
 just run and reckless 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.790
 situations we have already seen in the case of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.040
 application in the cast it once 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.810
 updated and began to develop in my 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.620
 insty crucifixion bought it too let you 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.180
 well let's see how he just called and 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.860
 then the guys, too, basically did 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's the same for me, he just too 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.640
 they released scans the coast 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.469
 the updated application is not old 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.820
 supports no longer update and 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:09.210
 asked for money for it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.609
 there are no minutes no half of any people 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.859
 that bypass this app here 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.090
 it is the policy of the developers themselves they 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.399
 just want to make more money 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 therefore, as a single application, we ask 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.520
 love and favor by the way if you talk 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.439
 about love and favor if you go to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.789
 top paid apps in the appstore then 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.140
 see that in the first place anyway 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.119
 the answer here is why the public seems to me 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.130
 warm enough it all took a 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.109
 Also worth noting is that for ipad 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.999
 I still do not understand the application 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.649
 maybe if it appears, too, probably 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.909
 will be paid possible for mac will be 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.649
 we will wait and see the paid general 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.689
 second question which people can 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.819
 ask me or anyone else and 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 generally ask them this in order 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.960
 currents us because the atomic application 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.569
 so here everything is more than transparent in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.579
 Twi be and just done the situation when 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.590
 account is kept at twitter former 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.350
 if you logs in with twitter 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.899
 the help of the new tweetbot 3 then the icon will be 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.569
 appear old and naturally tokin 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.670
 they had a limit not exhausted more correctly 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.160
 were limit was much exceeded during 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.990
 when twitter just introduced all of these 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.069
 measures therefore 3 years with this all is well 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.409
 no problem 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.420
 will be with new customers as well 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.519
 probably stupid to let out completely 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.870
 new client from the developers of the pipe 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.109
 the developers have played us a little 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.819
 they said just yesterday that apple 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.409
 refused him to review this application 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.969
 have to wait another week after that 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.829
 after a few hours the old answer dot 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.299
 by disappeared from the appstore or here it appeared 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.769
 new worth 3 bucks 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.480
 I recommend that tourist again 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.620
 buyer let's go a little bit 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.909
 because what really changed 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.919
 functionality virtually nothing 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.349
 the opposite has changed even a little bit 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.120
 slightly diminished the example of the triple 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.799
 tempo for the answer now no maybe he 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.900
 will appear in the next versions but it 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.340
 less design has become much more at the same time 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.750
 an example to add a new one 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.549
 the account you see here is such a little window 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.199
 such circles buttons in ios7 style 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.299
 changed settings changed all windows 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.280
 there is such a blackout proprietary 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.230
 have a distance decrease and so on 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.900
 if you click on any lead then 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.760
 it darkens to see exactly what 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.230
 of them pressed you can retweet it 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 And if you clamp retweet as 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.400
 before you can love you any 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.930
 account you can see the details about 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.099
 this view can be done with 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.340
 saw buttons 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.829
 or just your plan left this way 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.659
 see the actual content of this tweet you 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.370
 can watch his retweets you can 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.290
 Tap on the glad species and see who it 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.150
 directly retweeted how much you 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.069
 added to their brewed and so on if 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.689
 you want to add tweet to the package this 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.659
 can be made from the main tape or already 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.150
 Three details of the Twitter view specifically here 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.150
 just click on the sample package button 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.799
 as before here there is a lower bar in 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 which you can read the Germans can 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.090
 look exactly copper 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.810
 tape in the machines also you can 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.090
 look 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.829
 direct manager and the last two buttons 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.439
 they are custom here 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.209
 drop-down window is as I said 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.859
 for the sake of functionality, change this 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.150
 the client is certainly not worth it here 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.979
 design has changed and in principle everything is well 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.199
 added even the opportunity to visit as 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:10.079
 in twitter when there are 2 at the same time 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.819
 accounts so when posting done 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.500
 it's all taking turns when composing 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.569
 by the way tweed you can immediately put and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.190
 machine hashtag and add a photo than 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.019
 everything is as before only much much 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.789
 more nice design i sure is 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.060
 I recommend the application is called am not 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.800
 with both 3 and the second thing we are today 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.570
 let's see this game dead trigger 2 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.460
 who appeared for free and for ios and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.099
 for android day droid it this time 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.590
 not horrible so show you at least her 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.060
 here actually in cyber this 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.130
 probably it is good that I didn't get on different 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.229
 graphics devices are different here on ipad 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.029
 she is the best I am here and some water and 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.400
 rains all things wherever it is on 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.199
 the center of the graphics has become better for nicer 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.479
 than in the case of the previous game but the most 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.180
 the main thing that appeared here 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.830
 plot now you go and not easy 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.529
 guard some territory see you 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.159
 and even there is some girl who 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.529
 says they say 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.990
 I will show you what to protect the territory 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.190
 do something and you already run and wet 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.620
 all zombies 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.240
 they give you money from them that's where they are 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.750
 I took the money honestly crazy not 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.029
 I will attach 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.029
 do you have any buildings for example 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.159
 you have to break these boards here 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.760
 I really liked the mode here 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.770
 now no need to clamp 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.820
 no buttons to shoot 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.050
 the default mode is on when 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.520
 automatic shooting takes place 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.250
 I think it's very cool you 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.480
 can fully concentrate on 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.510
 task because now there are some 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.010
 tasks it is also very good here we are 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.800
 did something here 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:42.670
 and actually try to go further 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.290
 Turn on this damn money and 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.990
 help this shit like 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.060
 all the zombies by the way here 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.390
 a lot of all sorts of things added 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.270
 and weapons a lot of new what rocks graphics 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.580
 the other you have to passing here 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.680
 doing something here is another thing 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.900
 which should be broken 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.130
 so so now we have these dudes 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.250
 you should not come here for them after 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.620
 this tells you 10 what my plans 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.300
 changed dough I have less than two 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.930
 minutes to do some kind of crap a and 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.700
 how do you see it here there is an arrow 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.310
 which shows what you have to do 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.060
 this moment 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:27.510
 where to go how many meters left and 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.220
 it also also changes in 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.690
 whichever room you are in 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.360
 that is, it is not just as in 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.860
 gta shows they say you have to go to that 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.810
 aside and if you can't go there but 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.690
 This type already your problems she specifically 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.860
 shows which way to go here we are 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.180
 send task done here 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.920
 level passed I think that figure you 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.950
 approximately met of course 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.330
 here is and not the purchase you will have 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.220
 buy more guns to 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.490
 probably feel like something more 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.080
 comfortable in this game but the less I 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.780
 so far the second level has gone 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.540
 are there any questions about 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.400
 something to pay I have not yet emerged 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.650
 the game is free so go to 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.650
 appstore and download and called d3 r2
