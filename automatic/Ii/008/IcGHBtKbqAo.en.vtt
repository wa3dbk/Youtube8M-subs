00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.489 

and<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.359> about<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> factory<00:00:36.929> moving<00:00:37.199> up<00:00:37.350> in

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
and what about the factory moving up in

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:40.160 
and what about the factory moving up in
weight<00:00:37.909> that's<00:00:38.909> not<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.359> big<00:00:39.570> finger<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
weight that's not really a big finger I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
weight that's not really a big finger I
think<00:00:40.769> that'll<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:40.949> a<00:00:41.039> lot<00:00:41.129> stronger<00:00:41.399> at

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
think that'll be a lot stronger at

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
think that'll be a lot stronger at
Enstone<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.300> only<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.659> five<00:00:42.870> pounds<00:00:43.050> away

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Enstone it's only like five pounds away

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.840 
Enstone it's only like five pounds away
from<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.159> 999<00:00:45.120> stole<00:00:45.390> mine<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.609> know

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
from you know 999 stole mine so you know

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.669 
from you know 999 stole mine so you know
I<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:48.510> I'll<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.719> stronger<00:00:49.140> might<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
I think I'll be stronger might be a

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.709 
I think I'll be stronger might be a
better<00:00:49.829> fighter<00:00:50.159> I'd<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> more<00:00:50.670> pressure<00:00:51.359> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
better fighter I'd be more pressure and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.680 
better fighter I'd be more pressure and
I<00:00:52.319> could<00:00:52.679> hold<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.129> power<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.359> know<00:00:54.479> i

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
I could hold a lot more power you know i

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.329 
I could hold a lot more power you know i
don't<00:00:54.960> kill<00:00:55.199> myself<00:00:55.229> to<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.859> way<00:00:55.979> close

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
don't kill myself to make the way close

as<00:00:58.409> well<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.710> wasn't<00:00:59.010> being<00:00:59.129> lightweight

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
as well as I wasn't being lightweight

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.219

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.689 
but we've looked at this way you know I
know<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.710> still<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.039> light<00:01:02.249> weight<00:01:02.429> so

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
know I can still make light weight so

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.459 
know I can still make light weight so
you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.269> maybe<00:01:03.479> we<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.870> world<00:01:04.049> tell<00:01:04.229> fire

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
you know maybe we need a world tell fire

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:05.660 
you know maybe we need a world tell fire
this<00:01:04.649> way<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.100> give<00:01:05.219> me<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.549> more

this way will give me a lot more
confidence<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.509> can<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.780> back<00:01:06.899> down

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
confidence and then I can go back down

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.109 
confidence and then I can go back down
to<00:01:07.170> light<00:01:07.469> weight<00:01:07.649> maybe<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.549> future<00:01:08.729> and
