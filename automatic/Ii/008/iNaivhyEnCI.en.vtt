enough and just place it in your bowl

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.170 
enough and just place it in your bowl
then<00:00:31.080> you're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> take<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.890> avocado

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
then you're going to take your avocado

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:41.500 
then you're going to take your avocado
and<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.989> just<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> cut<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.280> half<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.119 

you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.719> say<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> other<00:00:43.140> half<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> later

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you can say the other half for it later

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
you can say the other half for it later
so<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.780> slice<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.410> into

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
so I'm going to just slice it into

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
so I'm going to just slice it into
halves<00:00:47.879> inside<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> much

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
halves inside just to make it that much

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
halves inside just to make it that much
easier<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.690> mash<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
easier because we are going to mash it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
easier because we are going to mash it
up<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> moment<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.370> using<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> same

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
up in a moment then using that same

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
up in a moment then using that same
spoon<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.930> am<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> spoon<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
spoon I am just going to spoon the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.299 
spoon I am just going to spoon the
avocado<00:00:57.000> into<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.620> bowl<00:01:00.649> next<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.070> want

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
avocado into the bowl next up you want

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
avocado into the bowl next up you want
to<00:01:02.430> take<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.969> fork<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> we're<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to take a fork and we're just going to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.990 
to take a fork and we're just going to
begin<00:01:04.680> mashing<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> together<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:08.340> best<00:01:08.760> if

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
begin mashing it together it's best if

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.149 
begin mashing it together it's best if
you<00:01:09.030> choose<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.750> avocado<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you choose an avocado that's like

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.250 
you choose an avocado that's like
already<00:01:11.580> ripe<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.780> way<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
already ripe a bit and that way it's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.219 
already ripe a bit and that way it's
going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> be<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> lot<00:01:13.979> easier<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:15.270> mush<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
going to be a lot easier to mush so I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.289 
going to be a lot easier to mush so I
would<00:01:16.350> definitely<00:01:16.920> choose<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> ripe

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
would definitely choose more of a ripe

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.219 
would definitely choose more of a ripe
avocado

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.170 

as<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.680> can<00:01:26.829> see<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.219> begins<00:01:27.579> to<00:01:27.850> look<00:01:27.880> like<00:01:28.030> a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
as you can see it begins to look like a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.050 
as you can see it begins to look like a
paste<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.289> you<00:01:29.350> just<00:01:29.590> want<00:01:29.829> to<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.520> make<00:01:30.759> sure
