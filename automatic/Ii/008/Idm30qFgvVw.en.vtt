to<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.119> father<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.460> just<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> what

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to the father and just kind of what

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.399 
to the father and just kind of what
would<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.119> been<00:01:09.330> said<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> transition

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
would have been said in the transition

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
would have been said in the transition
so<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.820> excited<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.659> album

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so I'm really excited about this album

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.310 
so I'm really excited about this album
it<00:01:13.770> turned<00:01:14.040> out<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.750> better<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
it turned out just so much better and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
it turned out just so much better and
deeper<00:01:16.710> than<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.490> expected<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.780> be

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
deeper than I really expected it to be

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.670 
deeper than I really expected it to be
when<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> first<00:01:19.439> started<00:01:19.770> writing<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.680> let

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
when I first started writing it and let

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.230 
when I first started writing it and let
a<00:01:22.710> few<00:01:23.009> friends<00:01:23.189> listen<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> already<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
a few friends listen to already and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.410 
a few friends listen to already and
received<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.380> great<00:01:25.530> feedback<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.549> it's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
received some great feedback so it's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
received some great feedback so it's
something<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.200> different<00:01:28.799> musically

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
something a little different musically

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
something a little different musically
for<00:01:29.759> me<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:31.159> used<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.600> piano<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.500> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
for me I used a lot more piano and it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.300 
for me I used a lot more piano and it's
more<00:01:34.740> piano<00:01:34.950> driven<00:01:35.840> rather<00:01:36.840> than<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:38.009> using

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
more piano driven rather than just using

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
more piano driven rather than just using
the<00:01:38.490> guitars<00:01:38.880> there's<00:01:39.479> still<00:01:39.720> plenty<00:01:39.930> of
