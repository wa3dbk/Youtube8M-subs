00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.010
 everyone knows if this gaming is 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.200
 find for a little tutorial region is going 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.700
 show how to fix an xbox 360 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.009
 so rode the material you need an xbox 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.329
 cotton or in him the little bit of 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.420
 cotton next door so I'm going to show you 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:19.400
 some you have to take off the cotton 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.440
 the technical river you will say 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.140
 you walk you will have no 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.270
 Here you must remove it and now 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.750
 we will go to the tutorial so there I leave 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.270
 not so my especially his two pilots for 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.530
 repair the rhode will already have its wings 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.190
 and less risky than the technique of 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.710
 towel and does not work on xbox 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.510
 360 line or the fan is just 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.699
 here or there is a grid 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.289
 aeration there in the back so the goal 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.089
 it's you know the side there is not 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.940
 of cotton you tried to block the 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.300
 women 's fan stands a black 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.690
 here and there you sink it 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.909
 we did not work, I know it's a 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.859
 little every time we see it right there 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.679
 walk so after what are you going 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.479
 do if you go light livebox and 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.299
 you are going to wait five thousand docomo 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.290
 she will be by early that dia I 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.030
 already done this repair 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.219
 see the margins slightly because 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.909
 I have already done the repair so you 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.500
 wait five minutes so take 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.130
 five minutes of expectations you 've been 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.960
 night box you gently remove the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.960
 two cotton buds straight 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.229
 and so after you will turn on your 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.520
 xbox and there he will have him the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.469
 fan who is really going a lot 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.329
 turned and if it still does not work 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.979
 addressed it again until that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.289
 worth walking 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.179
 you can try directly 5 6 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.710
 minutes of a couple or even seven minutes 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.210
 but it's not very strongly 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000
 advised as you can see the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 livebox has been repaired so I repair them 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.689
 and yesterday in what walk always 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.789
 so see this technique that I think 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.439
 that it will last because it warms up a little 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.659
 the air duct that inside the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.780
 xbox what are you going to do a little fund of 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 the state and stick them with the bottom so 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.439
