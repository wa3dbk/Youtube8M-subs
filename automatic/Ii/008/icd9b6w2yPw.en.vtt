00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
context of the story lines does this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.790 
context of the story lines does this
make<00:00:47.010> any<00:00:47.280> sense<00:00:48.200> but<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> Undertaker

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
make any sense but when the Undertaker

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.210 
make any sense but when the Undertaker
came<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.280> Monday<00:00:51.210> Night<00:00:51.360> Raw<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:52.110> found<00:00:52.980> myself

came on Monday Night Raw I found myself
not<00:00:53.790> caring<00:00:54.450> if<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.720> made<00:00:54.960> sense<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
not caring if it made sense I just

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.130 
not caring if it made sense I just
wanted<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:58.200> fight<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> context<00:01:01.050> is
