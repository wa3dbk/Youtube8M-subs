but really people really do only use a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
but really people really do only use a
small<00:00:17.580> percentage<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> capabilities<00:00:19.020> on

small percentage of the capabilities on
their<00:00:19.710> iPad<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.490> largely<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.720> people

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
their iPad and largely because people

are so busy they don't either have time

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.920 
are so busy they don't either have time
to<00:00:23.519> learn<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.269> may<00:00:24.359> not<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.600> aware<00:00:24.869> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
application down and it looks like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
application down and it looks like
you've<00:01:16.320> close<00:01:16.560> everything<00:01:16.830> down<00:01:16.950> those

background so when you four finger swipe

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.060 
background so when you four finger swipe
up<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.540> these<00:01:25.070> applications

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
up you can see all these applications

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
up you can see all these applications
that<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.310> open<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.259> if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.380> tap<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.689> it's

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
what the keyboard is capable of now the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.250 
what the keyboard is capable of now the
first<00:04:39.240> thing<00:04:39.360> i<00:04:39.540> want<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.720> show<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.960> about<00:04:40.110> the

first thing i want to show you about the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.630 
first thing i want to show you about the
keyboard<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:40.830> may<00:04:40.950> not<00:04:41.100> know<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.580> that

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
keyboard that you may not know is that

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.140 
keyboard that you may not know is that
if<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.600> use<00:04:42.930> two<00:04:43.920> fingers<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.820> do<00:04:44.970> that

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
if you use two fingers and you do that

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.480 
if you use two fingers and you do that

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
spread so you go one way with one finger

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.220 
spread so you go one way with one finger
in<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.880> other<00:04:48.030> way<00:04:48.210> with<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.390> other<00:04:48.630> finger

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
in the other way with the other finger

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.100 
in the other way with the other finger
you<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.830> split<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.610> keyboard<00:04:51.180> into<00:04:51.690> hat<00:04:51.930> you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
you can split the keyboard into hat you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.680 
you can split the keyboard into hat you
can<00:04:52.170> split<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.530> into<00:04:52.710> two<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:54.180> if<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.450> use

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
can split it into two and so if you use

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.440 
can split it into two and so if you use
your<00:04:54.900> hands<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.830> hold<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.400> ipad<00:04:57.060> here

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
shortcuts for example when you're typing

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
shortcuts for example when you're typing
let's<00:05:33.870> let's<00:05:34.620> backspace<00:05:35.340> one<00:05:35.669> here<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:37.500> I

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
let's let's backspace one here and I

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.740 
let's let's backspace one here and I
want<00:05:38.070> to<00:05:38.160> pay<00:05:38.310> to<00:05:38.370> put<00:05:38.730> a<00:05:38.760> period<00:05:39.120> there<00:05:39.300> at<00:05:39.660> the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
want to pay to put a period there at the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.659 
want to pay to put a period there at the
end<00:05:39.900> of<00:05:40.050> Jim<00:05:40.290> anthony<00:05:40.710> will<00:05:40.890> i<00:05:41.070> will<00:05:41.400> double

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
end of Jim anthony will i will double

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.659 
end of Jim anthony will i will double
tap<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.270> spacebar<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.950> puts<00:05:44.160> a<00:05:44.250> period

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
tap the spacebar and it puts a period

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.420 
tap the spacebar and it puts a period
there<00:05:44.700> and<00:05:45.060> automatically<00:05:45.750> capitalizes<00:05:46.530> the

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
there and automatically capitalizes the

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.130 
there and automatically capitalizes the
next<00:05:47.760> word<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:49.040> so<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.190> double<00:05:50.640> space<00:05:51.330> bar<00:05:51.780> is

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
next word so so the double space bar is

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.440 
next word so so the double space bar is
a<00:05:52.680> good<00:05:53.310> way<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.490> put<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:53.730> period<00:05:53.970> down<00:05:54.240> there

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
a good way to put a period down there
