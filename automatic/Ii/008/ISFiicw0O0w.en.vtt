00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.289
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.020
 dmitry and again our channel oven overview with 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.359
 today we decided to prepare your review 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.559
 on enough curious french 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.019
 manufacturer Kashin company 37 years on 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.940
 European market use of large 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.530
 quantities of iron in production 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 heating equipment and very 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.930
 interesting and i would say attract a 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.230
 Appearance seems to me company kashin 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.910
 deserve your attention 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.399
 Kashin company produces three lines 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.190
 furnace products each of which 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.600
 will find a buyer 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.550
 each first-line oven 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.840
 the title has an index 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.489
 c what stands for worms what 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.729
 models of this line is available in 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.490
 different colors are now fashionable 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.459
 nice brown green burgundy 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.429
 dark blue and ivory 

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.560
 and classic black and worth noting 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.990
 that the oven outside is not just painted 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.539
 any kind of gloss paint and this 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.149
 special environmentally friendly 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.860
 heat resistant enamel which over time does not 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.709
 cracked and not in any way 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.380
 will be erased and by the way very nice 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.899
 she is very made of cast iron whole 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.929
 external framework of the furnaces worth noting that 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.390
 the thickness of the cast iron is 6 millimeters per 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.140
 what we immediately go to our frame 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.360
 furnace chamber which is made of 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.030
 heat resistant heat resistant steel for sure 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.729
 which is 4 millimeter if we open 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.429
 the door we will see that the combustion chamber 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.399
 inside has chamotte lining and 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.800
 chamotte thickness three centimeters why 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.530
 need inside the chamotte first is 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.810
 allows heat to linger longer 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.060
 inside the combustion chamber and secondly not 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.640
 give the fire a direct touch 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.950
 steel frame of our furnace 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.590
 Well now let's talk about the features and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.860
 there are quite a few of them in the company's furnaces 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.090
 Kashin the first thing I want to note is that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.480
 ovens 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.310
 Charleston lines have as standard 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.470
 and the required set of functions which 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.600
 inherent in any modern 1000 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.420
 equipment but also has 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.030
 rather rare functionality about which 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.430
 we also went to standard today 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.010
 functions can be attributed pure function 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.709
 glass and convection function now i'm 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 talk about them in detail the function is clean 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.030
 glass is a necessary element 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.650
 which is useful to us as never before 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.670
 active operation of the furnace 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.940
 equipment 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.190
 so we can understand that the glass with 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.080
 the inner side is supposed to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.090
 contact with open fire 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.380
 flame if the flame is with us 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.000
 directly will somehow 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.000
 interact with the glass surface 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.250
 then whatever the surface of this 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.400
 glass will be smoked thanks to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.370
 special holes on top of our stove 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.799
 air goes down 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.799
 which does not give this very fire 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.010
 touch directly behind the glass 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.200
 most it smokes convection function 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.600
 also available in pec data like i already 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.510
 said something about convection function 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.570
 between the cast-iron frame of our furnace and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.030
 steel flue chamber there is a small 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.549
 cavity and it is around from 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.190
 flourish and bottom combustion chamber 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.470
 furnace air enters directly into 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.570
 this cavity in this convection skin 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.579
 how correctly probably u call and 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.549
 the expiration of how he rises to the top 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.680
 it heats up with special 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.810
 holes that find you on the cover 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.000
 Our furnaces are you now is all he can 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.700
 already hot coming out and through our 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.640
 premises are thus much faster 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.410
 put it on 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.750
 from not quite standard functions we for 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.930
 have revealed themselves forced dumping halls and 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.630
 connection functions air from outside then 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.859
 there is from an alternative source 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.290
 forced room reset function and 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.419
 is very helpful and people who 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.760
 already have or ever used 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.099
 stove and stone equipment you say 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.070
 then we need this function necessarily 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:28.220
 how is it carried in stoves than 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.680
 liston side of the furnace we can observe 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.280
 small regulator small lever on 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.780
 even correctly call him that when we 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.720
 interact with this lever something 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.849
 the cherry lattice starts to move it 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.280
 passage hall that has accumulated on it 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.260
 but for a reason it is quite natural not 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.020
 falls down because just the same 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.430
 the density of this room is big enough 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.460
 likewise pouring sleep down thereby 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.650
 cleaning our little grate 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.260
 the fact that in principle it is aesthetically pleasing 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.840
 Of course, it looks much better 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.120
 into our furnace into the air oxygen for 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.140
 burning gets much better and so 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.849
 most gorenje 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.599
 inside the combustion chamber will be much 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.450
 more beautiful and intense and and quite 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.750
 rare features and functions we have identified 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.789
 side loading firewood thanks to 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.060
 specially the door which is with 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.159
 right side of the furnace thanks to this 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.010
 the format of loading firewood is not enough 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.690
 leg is more convenient that is ray heat 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.000
 which comes directly from 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.890
 glass she is very powerful and sometimes just 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.640
 just open the door when your 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.039
 the oven is already burning 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.289
 uncomfortable here is such a side 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.840
 loading firewood will of course make it easier for us 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.150
 this process and more than that 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.530
 cuddle more and the size of these very firewood 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.120
 can reach as much as 50 centimeters when 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.610
 we first saw the furnace through 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.520
 only it became interesting and very 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.430
 it is interesting why the handles are made in 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.650
 such a spiral shaped like 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.780
 design chick but could see 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.570
 probably in Finnish sauna stoves 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.220
 manufacturers and it is not clear why in 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.800
 In this case, it is implemented just such 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.320
 execution option but it turned out to be very 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.620
 just thanks to such pens company 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.810
 Kashin implemented the function coat and what 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.090
 in Russian means cold hands here 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.180
 thanks to this spiral we have a pen 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.830
 will not be so hot and we at 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.280
 operation of this furnace equipment 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.190
 never about 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.020
 johns and but we all need to know and if you 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.790
 do not know it now tell you what 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.950
 according to the rules of operation of the furnace 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.610
 equipment in the instructions each is 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.380
 is written 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.020
 the person must wear 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.080
 special not all kind of protective 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.720
 gloves so for example don't get burned by 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.940
 doors or about any other part 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.190
 ovens because the temperature during 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.830
 operation of the furnace equipment is very 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.720
 high and of course probably the most 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.110
 interesting function that we have not yet 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.710
 called this feature as an option 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.900
 connect furnaces special 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.720
 water heater that will give 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.600
 our furnaces have more uniqueness and 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.820
 the main practicality in this way 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.160
 dear friends we can from the classic 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.169
 food if you want to make a powerful 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.419
 heating hybrid which besides 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:17.790
 natural heat from the fire will allow us 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.919
 significantly saves money we 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.169
 we spend for example hot water 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.090
 the company kashin in the char liston series 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:29.340
 offer the following models 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:32.520
 c2 c3 c4 and c5 all these models before 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:35.100
 differ in power from each other 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.220
 and dimensions more detailed information 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:41.039
 you can get by going to the fireplace site 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.380
 point ru new dear friends big 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.870
 thanks for continuing to watch with us 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.479
