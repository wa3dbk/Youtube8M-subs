00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
alright so lately I've been looking over

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.410 
alright so lately I've been looking over
the<00:00:03.659> stereo<00:00:04.080> science<00:00:04.529> center<00:00:04.890> website<00:00:05.549> this

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the stereo science center website this

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.040 
the stereo science center website this
is<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.629> NASA<00:00:06.870> website<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:09.150> basically<00:00:09.420> shows

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is a NASA website and it basically shows

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.950 
is a NASA website and it basically shows
your<00:00:10.500> images<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.040> our<00:00:11.160> son<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:12.509> get<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> view

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
your images of our son you get the view

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.880 
your images of our son you get the view
from<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.559> behind<00:00:15.080> serial<00:00:16.080> telescope<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
from the behind serial telescope and the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.820 
from the behind serial telescope and the
head<00:00:17.220> stereo<00:00:17.970> telescope<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.750> had<00:00:19.350> been<00:00:19.560> ahead

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
head stereo telescope I had been ahead

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.220 
head stereo telescope I had been ahead
of<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> orbit<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.640> Earth<00:00:21.050> behind<00:00:22.050> being

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
of the orbit of Earth behind being

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
of the orbit of Earth behind being
behind<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.710> orbit<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:24.109> guess<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.880> these<00:00:26.880> views

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
behind the orbit I guess so these views

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.960 
behind the orbit I guess so these views
here<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.869> behind<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> its<00:00:29.730> view

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
here you can see behind this is its view

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.240 
here you can see behind this is its view
angles<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> head<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
angles here and then the head this is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.950 
angles here and then the head this is
its<00:00:32.579> views<00:00:32.850> angles<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.480> between<00:00:33.630> those

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
its views angles here between those

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.799 
its views angles here between those
dotted<00:00:34.320> lines<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> there's<00:00:36.480> nothing<00:00:36.540> really

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
dotted lines so there's nothing really

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
dotted lines so there's nothing really
in<00:00:36.989> its<00:00:37.140> view<00:00:37.290> path<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:37.969> what<00:00:38.969> I'm

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
in its view path right here what I'm

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.720 
in its view path right here what I'm
really<00:00:39.420> interested<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.350> an<00:00:40.739> object<00:00:41.520> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
really interested in is an object that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.080 
really interested in is an object that
moves<00:00:42.059> slightly<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.960> front<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> Sun<00:00:44.090> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
moves slightly in front of the Sun and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.229 
moves slightly in front of the Sun and
moves<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.829> towards<00:00:46.829> Earth<00:00:47.039> I'm<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.969> sure<00:00:48.149> if

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
moves out towards Earth I'm not sure if

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.439 
moves out towards Earth I'm not sure if
this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.390> common<00:00:48.899> element<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.789> but<00:00:50.789> take<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this is common element or not but take a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.410 
this is common element or not but take a
look<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> go<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.059> NASA

moving across the sky not certain how

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.340 
moving across the sky not certain how
big<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:45.940> if<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.240> an<00:02:46.360> asteroid<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.900> comment

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
big it is if it's an asteroid a comment

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.830 
big it is if it's an asteroid a comment
or<00:02:47.440> what<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:48.640> does<00:02:48.790> seem<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.030> go<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.420> one

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
particular direction not sure if that

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.410 
particular direction not sure if that
means<00:02:52.750> anything<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.670> watches<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.850> approaches

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
means anything but watches it approaches

a darkness here across this i'm not sure

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.930 
a darkness here across this i'm not sure
seems<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.350> seems<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.770> go<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.070> out<00:03:00.310> here<00:03:00.640> at

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
seems it seems to go in it out here at

seems it seems to go in it out here at
this<00:03:01.060> moment<00:03:01.330> i'm<00:03:01.600> not<00:03:01.750> sure<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.520> near

this moment i'm not sure if it's near

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.440 
this moment i'm not sure if it's near
the<00:03:04.450> Sun<00:03:04.840> or<00:03:05.110> how<00:03:05.320> close<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.540> actual

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the Sun or how close it is to the actual

the Sun or how close it is to the actual
telescope<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:11.070> above<00:03:12.070> my<00:03:12.280> mouse<00:03:12.520> here<00:03:12.850> you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
telescope but above my mouse here you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.180 
telescope but above my mouse here you
could<00:03:13.210> see<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.690> watch<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:14.020> as<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.410> moves<00:03:14.980> across

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
could see it watch it as it moves across

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.670 
could see it watch it as it moves across
the<00:03:15.460> Sun<00:03:17.790> still<00:03:18.790> going

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
the Sun still going

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.640 
the Sun still going
over<00:03:21.219> the<00:03:21.370> Sun<00:03:21.640> here

over the Sun here

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.600 
over the Sun here
really<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:24.579> certain<00:03:24.909> how<00:03:25.870> close<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.379> is<00:03:26.610> but

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
really not certain how close it is but

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.330 
really not certain how close it is but
you<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:27.819> watch<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.500> moves<00:03:29.500> across<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.890> Sun

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
you can watch as it moves across the Sun

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.949 
you can watch as it moves across the Sun
they're<00:03:30.549> now<00:03:30.700> going<00:03:30.849> into<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.239> beam<00:03:31.750> of

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
they're now going into this beam of

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.520 
they're now going into this beam of
light<00:03:32.140> coming<00:03:32.470> off<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.980> Sun<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.569> then<00:03:34.569> slowly

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
light coming off the Sun and then slowly

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.750 
light coming off the Sun and then slowly
makes<00:03:35.890> its<00:03:36.069> way<00:03:36.629> up<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.519> direction

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
makes its way up in this direction

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.600 
makes its way up in this direction
it's<00:03:42.330> just<00:03:42.540> amazing

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
it's just amazing

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.070 
it's just amazing

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
really watching this

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.880 
really watching this
move

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.590 

I<00:03:50.980> don't<00:03:51.610> know<00:03:51.670> I've<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:52.000> never<00:03:52.150> seen

below and tell me what you think this is
move<00:03:59.950> all<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.340> way<00:04:00.400> across<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.940> screen<00:04:01.150> here

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.690 

and<00:04:06.220> off<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.390> image<00:04:07.780> here<00:04:08.080> you<00:04:09.070> can<00:04:09.220> see<00:04:09.400> as

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
and off of the image here you can see as

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.880 
and off of the image here you can see as
a<00:04:09.760> date<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.600> down<00:04:10.900> here<00:04:11.260> we<00:04:11.410> are<00:04:11.530> now<00:04:11.650> at

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
a date is down here we are now at

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.050 
a date is down here we are now at
September<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.670> 11th

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.560 

and<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:17.139> object<00:04:17.650> now<00:04:17.829> moves<00:04:18.130> off<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.639> screen

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
and the object now moves off the screen

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.810 
and the object now moves off the screen
so<00:04:21.170> yeah<00:04:21.470> let<00:04:21.740> me<00:04:21.890> uh<00:04:21.920> let<00:04:22.220> me<00:04:22.400> know<00:04:22.520> what<00:04:22.670> you

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
so yeah let me uh let me know what you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.250 
so yeah let me uh let me know what you
think<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.150> that<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.600> thought<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.140> was

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
think of that I I thought that was

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.950 
think of that I I thought that was
interesting<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.890> wanted<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.220> share<00:04:25.460> that

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
interesting and wanted to share that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.310 
interesting and wanted to share that
this<00:04:26.960> pixilation<00:04:27.530> happens<00:04:27.890> as<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.340> image

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
this pixilation happens as the image

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.070 
this pixilation happens as the image
gets<00:04:30.320> closer<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.980> dates<00:04:31.670> today's<00:04:32.480> date<00:04:32.780> I

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
gets closer to the dates today's date I

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.970 
gets closer to the dates today's date I
guess<00:04:33.260> they<00:04:33.410> don't<00:04:33.530> have<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.830> best

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
guess they don't have the best

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.600 
guess they don't have the best
resolution<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.940> nearest<00:04:35.720> eighth<00:04:36.020> image
