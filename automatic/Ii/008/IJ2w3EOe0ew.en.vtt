you<00:00:22.539> just<00:00:22.720> bought<00:00:22.960> this<00:00:23.109> back<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.910> we're<00:00:25.119> in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
you just bought this back and we're in

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.109 
you just bought this back and we're in
reverse<00:00:26.340> however<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.430> pull<00:00:27.609> it<00:00:27.730> back<00:00:27.910> the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
reverse however you pull it back the

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.310 
reverse however you pull it back the
faster<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:28.660> go<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.529> then<00:00:29.949> the<00:00:31.110> just<00:00:32.110> push<00:00:32.290> it

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
faster you go and then the just push it

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.560 
faster you go and then the just push it
forward<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:32.860> slow<00:00:33.040> down<00:00:33.250> now<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:33.970> can<00:00:34.239> hit<00:00:34.360> this

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
forward to slow down now I can hit this

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.000 
forward to slow down now I can hit this
I'm<00:00:35.320> already<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.519> same<00:00:39.730> concept<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
I'm already it's the same concept the

I'm already it's the same concept the
harder<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.400> push<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.790> forward<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.329> faster

you<00:00:44.290> go<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.570> I<00:00:46.690> can<00:00:46.839> pull<00:00:47.019> this<00:00:47.170> back<00:00:47.409> to<00:00:47.739> slow

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
you go and I can pull this back to slow

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.030 
you go and I can pull this back to slow
back<00:00:48.220> down<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:49.329> then<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:49.930> in<00:00:50.409> the<00:00:50.589> monitor

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
back down and then this in the monitor

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.219 
back down and then this in the monitor
here<00:00:51.070> I've<00:00:51.909> already<00:00:52.149> set<00:00:52.449> up<00:00:52.600> some<00:00:52.809> preset

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
here I've already set up some preset

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.099 
here I've already set up some preset
speeds<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.550> you<00:00:54.609> can<00:00:54.820> preset<00:00:55.269> your<00:00:55.449> speeds<00:00:55.780> and

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
speeds so you can preset your speeds and

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.200 
speeds so you can preset your speeds and
dial<00:00:56.289> it<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.620> right<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.370> exact<00:00:57.760> speed<00:00:58.030> you

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
dial it in right to the exact speed you

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.750 
dial it in right to the exact speed you
want<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.449> go<00:00:58.600> so<00:00:58.899> if<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.140> want<00:00:59.289> to<00:00:59.350> go<00:00:59.760> 6.8

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
want to go so if you want to go 6.8

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.639 
want to go so if you want to go 6.8
miles<00:01:00.969> an<00:01:01.210> hour<00:01:01.329> I<00:01:01.690> can<00:01:01.929> take<00:01:02.050> this<00:01:02.199> thumb<00:01:02.469> down

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
miles an hour I can take this thumb down

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.580 
miles an hour I can take this thumb down
and<00:01:02.859> hit<00:01:03.219> it<00:01:03.340> up<00:01:03.429> to<00:01:03.550> 6.8<00:01:04.149> and<00:01:04.390> then<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.320> speed

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
and hit it up to 6.8 and then to speed

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.690 
and hit it up to 6.8 and then to speed
up<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.130> target<00:01:07.060> speed<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.560> it'll<00:01:09.550> hold

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
up to that target speed and it'll hold

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.359 
up to that target speed and it'll hold
me<00:01:09.850> at<00:01:09.970> 6.8<00:01:10.509> miles<00:01:10.720> an<00:01:10.960> hour<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.860> if<00:01:15.009> we<00:01:15.160> want

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
me at 6.8 miles an hour and if we want

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:29.820 
me at 6.8 miles an hour and if we want
we<00:01:15.490> could<00:01:15.700> kick<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:16.060> auto<00:01:16.240> guidance

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.760 

so<00:01:30.400> now<00:01:30.550> we're<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.930> chapter<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.710> to

transmission will hold you right at the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.450 
transmission will hold you right at the
speed<00:01:37.480> that<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.690> want<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:37.960> be<00:01:38.110> at<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.470> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460
