00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.440
 hello my name is my prototype 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 and today I present you here 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 my minecraft world for pink panthers 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:23.490
 says the games always start with 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:26.130
 this beautiful switch here so here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 There are 15 seats for 15 players 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 which can also be extended 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 behind are boxes the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.719
 can be filled with items seal 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.120
 Players can and will need it 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 Let's go further 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 here 's a mini game while you can 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 probably already recognize it 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 this is about archery, however 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.949
 you do not necessarily have the medium 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 but hit one of these buttons 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.899
 counts then sounds as this comes 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.430
 signal word that one here 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.369
 this thing has hit the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.010
 chances of success is very high, however 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.229
 it sometimes errors like this 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 Then there is a nice one here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.890
 room where the players go in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.330
 need to decide in order to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 which room you will go to one of them 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:31.159
 then ever blown up 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.159
 switch around and the spider 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.120
 a bit loud the bypass will be 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 not affected by this 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.880
 is surrounded by obsidian 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.600
 Here we have a nice one too 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.080
 helicopter landing pad one 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:59.620
 startbahn a jump and run so small 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:05.500
 two tankers a small npc village and 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.700
 Here you come to a norton 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.180
 Here you come to one more 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:18.130
 jump'n'run the catch to a fault leads 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:24.030
 yes super here and then here is one 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.030
 treehouse that I can not stand 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.160
 for this jump high but also quite a 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.410
 normal way the man climb up here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.120
 I have not shown anything like that here 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.290
 Can you then also the web can 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.349
 each case will be extended 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.209
 can give me ideas in the comments 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.410
 write 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.549
 or in the high if someone else 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.330
 good finds helps a little 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:57.630
 jump board can be called one 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:05.709
 beach or lake with a bar 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:09.959
 tables and toilets that's it 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.670
 actually for the first I have for it 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.140
 not so long time needed so it 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.140
 he actually went faster 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.400
 So if you have that, just write 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.720
 in the comments I will take you then 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.049
 probably put into action and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:35.380
 I thank you for it 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:37.530
 watch and hope the work has become 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.530
 worth 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:52.319
 So then until next time 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.319
 maybe then look
