I'm they seem to go into shock and die
very<00:01:55.960> rapidly<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.670> has<00:01:57.820> been<00:01:57.850> a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
very rapidly and so this has been a

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.290 
very rapidly and so this has been a
problem<00:01:58.390> all<00:01:58.930> over<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.500> world<00:01:59.680> to<00:02:00.640> scientists

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
problem all over the world to scientists

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.630 
problem all over the world to scientists
it<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.780> clear<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.230> there<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.620> only<00:02:02.770> one<00:02:03.280> thing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
it is clear that there is only one thing

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.880 
it is clear that there is only one thing
threatening<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.660> survival<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:05.260> vaquita<00:02:05.590> and

threatening the survival of vaquita and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.940 
threatening the survival of vaquita and
that<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.610> gill<00:02:06.880> net<00:02:07.090> fishing<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:08.800> I've

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
that is gill net fishing so I've

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.920 
that is gill net fishing so I've
traveled<00:02:09.430> through<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.610> desert<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.600> small

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
traveled through the desert to the small
