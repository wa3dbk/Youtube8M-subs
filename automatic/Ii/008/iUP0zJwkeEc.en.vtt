00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.030
 in the early evening we can see the west 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.789
 the brightest of the Venus planets 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.210
 visible in the constellation of Sagittarius until 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.939
 at 9:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.820
 appears on the other side of the sky the second 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.769
 brightest planet jupiter that is 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.910
 in the constellation of twins 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:36.220
 it is visible until the dawn of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.309
 dawn appears in the sky two more 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.309
 Mars the first planets being born 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.399
 man 6 to the east in the constellation of virgin 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.789
 in the early morning of 26 students will be 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.969
 right on the red planet and at 4 o'clock 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.460
 also appears east on the 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.480
 pound constellation the moon will pass 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.879
 near him 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 at dawn on the last Sunday of the year 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.259
 2013 was a year of many events 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.329
 astronomical 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.310
 Let's remind some who called the 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.409
 attention everyone 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 the year began literally with a 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 burst on the morning of February 15 one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 asteroid fragment of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.000
 approximately 17 meters exploded on 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.789
 the russian province of cheliabinsk wounding 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 almost 1500 people and causing damage 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.539
 millionaires 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 the phenomenon was recorded by many 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.399
 people and surveillance cameras 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.549
 so the dimensions is the trajectory of the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.679
 object were determined quickly 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.189
 fragments of the meteorite were removed 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.569
 the crater of a frozen lake 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 interestingly, this event occurred in the 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.840
 same time as the 2012 asteroid of a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.729
 14 made a passage near the earth 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.009
 the incredible coincidence since the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.149
 trajectories of the objects were totally 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.789
 many different 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.140
 another very commented news was the 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.450
 space agency announcement 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.649
 on the space probe 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.289
 void 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.220
 in September the probe reached the space 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.230
 interstellar various media 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.630
 reported that the probe would have 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.030
 but this was not the case. 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.880
 in fact the voyage was a departure from 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 region known as the heliosphere where the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.010
 solar wind is present she is still going 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 take tens of thousands of years to 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.230
 reach another star system and not 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.579
 we could not comment on the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.130
 comet and zon 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.260
 discovered at the end of 2012 wisdom 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.630
 promised to be one of the most 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.959
 history and soon won the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.359
 Comet nickname of the century was assembled 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.850
 a major observation campaign for 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.459
 follow the approach of the comet 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.010
 however the evolution of its brightness does not 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.930
 occurred as expected even in the weeks 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.560
 which preceded its maximum approximation 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.180
 from the sun the sound still remained an object 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.030
 invisible to the naked eye 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.549
 on the day that the sun came closer to him 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.239
 sound was closely followed throughout the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.090
 the world 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.769
 solar satellites 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.690
 transmitted the images of this contact 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.910
 almost immediate 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.870
 suddenly nothing else could be seen in the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.480
 images 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.370
 news of death documents popped up 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.409
 on the social networks 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.260
 but to everyone's surprise there was a 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.780
 miracle of cosmic resurrection remains 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.250
 of the comet were observed again in the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.739
 original trajectory 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.989
 nicknamed Ghost of the Sun East 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.769
 clusters of fragments 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.780
 dissipated 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.530
 ending this fantastic journey 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.140
 celeste 2014 also reserves some 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.450
 great events of heaven in the next 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.650
 Let's talk about what to expect. 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.180
 next year 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.180
 Until then and your books to everyone.
