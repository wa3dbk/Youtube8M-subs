all<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.489> way<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.980> 34<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
all the way up here to the 34 and the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.420 
all the way up here to the 34 and the
distance<00:02:34.560> between<00:02:34.650> 15<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.610> 34<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.510> 19<00:02:37.430> inches

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
distance between 15 and 34 is 19 inches

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.729 
distance between 15 and 34 is 19 inches
there's<00:02:38.790> metric<00:02:39.420> units<00:02:40.019> if<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:40.620> you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
there's metric units if that's what you

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.530 
there's metric units if that's what you
prefer<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:43.110> my<00:02:43.319> scale<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.680> set<00:02:44.540> this

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
prefer and now my scale is set this

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.660 
prefer and now my scale is set this
tells<00:02:45.870> me<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.079> have<00:02:46.170> six<00:02:46.799> pieces<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.190> paper<00:02:47.459> to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.229 
tells me I have six pieces of paper to
print<00:02:47.849> off<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:49.290> let's<00:02:50.010> first<00:02:50.549> let's<00:02:50.880> adjust

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
print off of so let's first let's adjust

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479 
print off of so let's first let's adjust
this<00:02:51.480> color<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> little<00:02:52.200> bit<00:02:52.319> there's<00:02:52.739> some<00:02:53.250> ink

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
this color a little bit there's some ink

program<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.970> can<00:02:57.000> automatically<00:02:57.750> just

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
program you can automatically just

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.440 
program you can automatically just
lighten<00:02:58.260> areas<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.700> does<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> really<00:03:00.090> good

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
lighten areas and it does a really good

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.740 
lighten areas and it does a really good
job

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
job

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.069

except<00:03:01.350> for<00:03:01.829> low<00:03:02.340> contrast<00:03:03.090> areas<00:03:03.359> like<00:03:03.810> this

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
except for low contrast areas like this

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.370 
except for low contrast areas like this
is<00:03:04.410> kind<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.859> washed<00:03:05.220> out<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.690> lost<00:03:06.930> my<00:03:07.200> edge

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
is kind of washed out and I lost my edge

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.170 
is kind of washed out and I lost my edge
here<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.420> there's<00:03:09.420> actually<00:03:09.750> an<00:03:09.930> even<00:03:10.109> more

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
here so there's actually an even more

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.720 
here so there's actually an even more
harsh<00:03:12.180> setting<00:03:12.750> which<00:03:13.530> would<00:03:13.739> be<00:03:13.799> nice<00:03:14.310> and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
harsh setting which would be nice and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.449 
harsh setting which would be nice and
higher<00:03:14.910> contrast<00:03:15.620> pictures<00:03:16.620> mine<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.069> not<00:03:17.220> so

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
higher contrast pictures mine is not so

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.680 
higher contrast pictures mine is not so
let's<00:03:17.609> go<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> custom<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:20.359> here<00:03:21.359> we<00:03:21.510> can

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
let's go to custom and here we can

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.080 
let's go to custom and here we can
change<00:03:21.959> your<00:03:22.350> brightness<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.190> gamma<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.970> I'm

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
change your brightness and gamma and I'm

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.940 
change your brightness and gamma and I'm
just<00:03:24.209> going<00:03:24.389> to<00:03:24.600> increase<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.350> gamma<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:26.010> lot

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
just going to increase the gamma a lot

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.550 
just going to increase the gamma a lot
that<00:03:28.950> looks<00:03:29.160> good<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.660> still<00:03:31.019> visually

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
that looks good and I can still visually

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.920 
that looks good and I can still visually
define<00:03:31.980> an<00:03:32.549> edge<00:03:32.730> right<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.120> that's<00:03:33.600> pretty

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
define an edge right here that's pretty

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.479 
define an edge right here that's pretty
much<00:03:34.049> all<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.350> matters<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.010> I'm<00:03:35.280> good<00:03:35.459> with

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
want to do is increase my printed area

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.059 
want to do is increase my printed area
as<00:03:54.209> much<00:03:54.420> as<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:55.109> on<00:03:55.139> these<00:03:55.470> pieces<00:03:55.829> of

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
as much as I can on these pieces of

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.550 
as much as I can on these pieces of
paper<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:56.609> I'm<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.840> increase<00:03:58.230> the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
paper so I'm going to increase the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.340 
paper so I'm going to increase the
overlap<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.220> way<00:03:59.639> I<00:03:59.669> can<00:03:59.910> trim<00:04:00.180> off<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
overlap that way I can trim off the the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.590 
overlap that way I can trim off the the
white<00:04:01.709> area<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:02.850> outside<00:04:03.239> of<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.389> paper

where it's not full
Ede<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.120> once<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.870> get<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.140> point<00:04:06.319> where<00:04:06.530> adds

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
Ede and once I get to a point where adds

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.119 
Ede and once I get to a point where adds
more<00:04:07.010> pages<00:04:07.519> let's<00:04:07.970> decrease<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.780> one<00:04:09.129> same

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
more pages let's decrease that one same

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.369 
more pages let's decrease that one same
thing<00:04:10.370> with<00:04:10.519> my<00:04:10.730> vertical<00:04:11.090> let's<00:04:11.569> go<00:04:12.140> all<00:04:12.349> the

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
thing with my vertical let's go all the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.170 
thing with my vertical let's go all the
way<00:04:12.560> till<00:04:12.769> it<00:04:12.890> adds<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.549> page<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.060> then

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
way till it adds a page and then

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.270 
way till it adds a page and then
subtract<00:04:14.659> one

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
subtract one

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.449 
subtract one
let's<00:04:16.820> check<00:04:17.120> print<00:04:17.479> overlap<00:04:18.169> area<00:04:18.620> let's<00:04:19.280> go

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
let's check print overlap area let's go

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.099 
let's check print overlap area let's go
ahead<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:19.729> Center<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.209> image<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.660> my<00:04:20.690> six

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
ahead and Center the image on my six

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.600 
ahead and Center the image on my six
pieces<00:04:21.350> here<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:23.389> let's<00:04:24.110> click<00:04:24.650> show

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
pieces here and let's click show

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.450 
pieces here and let's click show
calibration<00:04:26.270> distance<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:27.050> output<00:04:27.710> really

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
calibration distance on output really

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.550 
calibration distance on output really
doesn't<00:04:28.729> matter<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.180> that's<00:04:29.690> my<00:04:29.930> 19<00:04:30.320> inches

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
doesn't matter but that's my 19 inches

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.900 
doesn't matter but that's my 19 inches
then<00:04:30.710> I'm<00:04:30.800> going<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:30.949> go<00:04:31.070> by<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:31.490> I'll<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.850> ahead

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
then I'm going to go by so I'll go ahead

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.129 
then I'm going to go by so I'll go ahead
