which is the usual ninety days in the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.979 
which is the usual ninety days in the
event<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.489> test<00:02:32.700> or<00:02:33.090> more<00:02:33.239> now<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:33.750> thing

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
event of the test or more now one thing

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.069 
event of the test or more now one thing
that<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.200> notice<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:36.180> talks<00:02:36.420> about<00:02:36.540> Malta

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
that I notice it's it talks about Malta

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.440 
that I notice it's it talks about Malta
and<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.590> play<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.859> party<00:02:38.340> game<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:39.329> if

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and what I play a party game but if

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.420 
and what I play a party game but if
there<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.780> no<00:02:39.930> mention<00:02:40.350> about<00:02:40.410> multi<00:02:41.190> player

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
there is no mention about multi player

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880 
there is no mention about multi player
so<00:02:41.790> my<00:02:42.030> guess<00:02:42.269> is<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.720> video<00:02:43.049> game<00:02:43.290> allows

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
so my guess is this video game allows

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.680 
so my guess is this video game allows
like<00:02:44.250> four<00:02:44.549> people<00:02:44.790> playing<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> same

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
like four people playing at the same

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.620 
like four people playing at the same
time<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.290> only<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.829> local<00:02:47.430> not<00:02:48.239> on<00:02:48.600> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
time but only on a local not on a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.569 
time but only on a local not on a
network<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.650> probably<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> is

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
network and it's probably what it is

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.819 
network and it's probably what it is
running<00:02:51.000> when<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.600> says<00:02:51.870> multi<00:02:52.230> player<00:02:52.440> party

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
running when it says multi player party

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.949 
running when it says multi player party
game<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.609> mainly<00:02:53.880> designer<00:02:54.359> probably<00:02:54.630> for

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
game it's mainly designer probably for

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.680 
game it's mainly designer probably for
kids<00:02:55.230> which<00:02:55.590> means<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:56.100> know<00:02:56.250> kids<00:02:57.120> get

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
kids which means you know kids get

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.690 
kids which means you know kids get
together<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.620> know<00:02:58.680> somebody's<00:02:59.190> elves<00:02:59.549> and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
together you know somebody's elves and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.670 
together you know somebody's elves and
they<00:02:59.819> play<00:03:00.269> together<00:03:00.660> instead<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.380> playing

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
they play together instead of playing

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.890 
they play together instead of playing
online<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.269> know<00:03:03.329> this<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.750> all<00:03:03.870> I

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
