more<00:00:02.760> computer<00:00:03.210> class<00:00:03.360> today<00:00:03.929> I'm<00:00:04.080> actually

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
more computer class today I'm actually

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.690 
more computer class today I'm actually
going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> start<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.830> new<00:00:04.980> Syria<00:00:05.310> but<00:00:05.400> game

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
going to start a new Syria but game

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.509 
going to start a new Syria but game
making<00:00:05.879> with<00:00:06.270> computer<00:00:06.690> craft<00:00:06.919> which<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.189> why

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
making with computer craft which is why

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.770 
making with computer craft which is why
i'm<00:00:08.580> actually<00:00:08.760> using<00:00:08.910> an<00:00:09.210> open<00:00:09.450> program

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
i'm actually using an open program

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.680 
i'm actually using an open program
called<00:00:10.080> computer<00:00:10.559> graphs<00:00:10.740> emulator<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
called computer graphs emulator it is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.870 
called computer graphs emulator it is
used<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.990> emulate<00:00:13.710> computers<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.580> compute

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
used to emulate computers for compute

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.700 
used to emulate computers for compute
graphs<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.389> works<00:00:15.870> really<00:00:16.020> well<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
graphs it works really well and it's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.500 
graphs it works really well and it's
significantly<00:00:17.310> faster<00:00:17.609> than<00:00:17.940> minecraft<00:00:18.330> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
significantly faster than minecraft this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.529 
significantly faster than minecraft this
is<00:00:18.660> why<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> must<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.170> using<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.619> rather<00:00:20.070> burn

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
is why I must be using this rather burn

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
is why I must be using this rather burn
well<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.810> another<00:00:22.080> minecraft<00:00:22.260> I'm<00:00:22.769> also

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
well one another minecraft I'm also

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.220 
well one another minecraft I'm also
going<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.789> start<00:00:24.029> nervous<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:24.779> game

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
going to start nervous really out game

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050 
going to start nervous really out game
making<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> program<00:00:26.369> called<00:00:26.519> game<00:00:26.789> maker

making with a program called game maker

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
making with a program called game maker
I'll<00:00:27.480> give<00:00:28.080> more<00:00:28.260> details<00:00:28.590> when<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.189> actually

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
I'll give more details when I'm actually

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
I'll give more details when I'm actually
starting<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.910> theory<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.660> let's<00:00:30.840> get

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
starting this theory but let's get

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.680 
starting this theory but let's get
focused<00:00:31.140> why<00:00:31.560> let's<00:00:31.830> stay<00:00:31.980> focused<00:00:32.160> on

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
focused why let's stay focused on

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.229 
focused why let's stay focused on
computer<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.700> do<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:36.090> what

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
computer at for now I do not know what

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.389 
computer at for now I do not know what
the<00:00:36.420> game<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.250> why

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the game is going to be so this is why

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.520 
the game is going to be so this is why
I'm<00:00:38.610> actually<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> core<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
I'm actually going to make the core of a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.590 
I'm actually going to make the core of a
program<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> main<00:00:41.160> skeleton<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.420> main

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
program the main skeleton the main

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.319 
program the main skeleton the main
structure<00:00:43.370> because<00:00:44.370> i<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
structure because i do not know what the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.440 
structure because i do not know what the
game<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.640> beg

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
game is going to be and if you can I beg

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
game is going to be and if you can I beg
you<00:00:48.600> please<00:00:48.899> give<00:00:49.829> me<00:00:49.950> any<00:00:50.100> suggestions<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you please give me any suggestions you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.979 
you please give me any suggestions you
have<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.910> mind<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.210> was<00:00:51.360> thinking<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.690> making

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
have in mind I was thinking about making

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.560 
have in mind I was thinking about making
a<00:00:52.170> minesweeper<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.910> any<00:00:54.149> better

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a minesweeper but if you have any better

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.959 
a minesweeper but if you have any better
idea<00:00:55.110> whatever<00:00:55.590> let<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> comment

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
idea whatever let me know in the comment

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
idea whatever let me know in the comment
section<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.660> am<00:00:57.840> interested<00:00:58.020> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
section I really am interested in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
section I really am interested in
knowing<00:00:59.059> we'll<00:01:00.059> leave<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:02.090> reason

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
knowing we'll leave it or not and reason

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.759 
knowing we'll leave it or not and reason
why<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.420> using<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.750> main<00:01:03.930> structure<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
why I'm using a main structure is that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.899 
why I'm using a main structure is that
most<00:01:05.519> games<00:01:06.200> use<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.470> users<00:01:08.159> main<00:01:08.369> structure

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
most games use the users main structure

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
most games use the users main structure
and<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> why<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.810> actually<00:01:10.760> use<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.560> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and this is why I can actually use it so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.800 
and this is why I can actually use it so
freely<00:01:13.890> without<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:15.409> without<00:01:16.409> actually

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
freely without actually without actually

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.420 
freely without actually without actually
being<00:01:18.810> afraid<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:19.920> work<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
being afraid with it will work because I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.450 
being afraid with it will work because I
know<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:20.880> work<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.420> most<00:01:21.540> cases

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
know it will work for most cases

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.499 
know it will work for most cases
basically<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.640> consists<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.390> all

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
basically it consists of first all

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.789 
basically it consists of first all
declaring<00:01:24.930> variables<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.500> variables

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
declaring variables those variables

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.440 
declaring variables those variables
since<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.610> didn't<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> game<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
since I didn't know what the game is I

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.730 
since I didn't know what the game is I
counts<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> declare<00:01:28.229> variables<00:01:28.590> because

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
counts and declare variables because

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.270 
counts and declare variables because
they<00:01:29.040> grandly<00:01:29.970> depends<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> game<00:01:31.170> is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
they grandly depends on what the game is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
they grandly depends on what the game is
when<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> declare<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.030> maint<00:01:33.270> functions<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.990> can

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
when I declare for maint functions I can

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200 
when I declare for maint functions I can
create<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.770> more<00:01:34.950> depending<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
create some more depending on all the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.660 
create some more depending on all the
game<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.680> four<00:01:37.950> main<00:01:38.220> functions

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
game is there are four main functions

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.069 
game is there are four main functions
which<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.840> must<00:01:40.130> imperatively<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
which we must imperatively be there and

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
which we must imperatively be there and
finally<00:01:43.079> there's<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.380> game<00:01:43.560> loop<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.040> you'll

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
finally there's a game loop so you'll

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.590 
finally there's a game loop so you'll
see<00:01:44.880> each<00:01:45.060> falls<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.479> detail<00:01:46.130> starting<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.600> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
see each falls in detail starting now so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
see each falls in detail starting now so
let's<00:01:48.780> talk<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.110> functions<00:01:49.640> first<00:01:50.640> one

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
let's talk with functions first one

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.899 
let's talk with functions first one
false<00:01:51.360> function<00:01:51.509> i<00:01:51.750> call<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
false function i call it in it and

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
false function i call it in it and
basically<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> used<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> initialize<00:01:55.409> all

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
basically it is used to initialize all

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.359 
basically it is used to initialize all
the<00:01:55.890> variables<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.640> data<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:58.369> there's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the variables and data you have there's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.709 
the variables and data you have there's
not<00:01:59.549> much<00:01:59.700> more<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.939> say<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
not much more to say about that it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.410 
not much more to say about that it's
just<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.740> functional<00:02:02.640> should<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.880> called<00:02:03.119> once

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just a functional should be called once

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
just a functional should be called once
at<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.750> beginning<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.409> game<00:02:04.649> next<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.759> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
at the beginning of a game next one is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.669 
at the beginning of a game next one is
display<00:02:07.729> or<00:02:08.729> i<00:02:08.879> call<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> display<00:02:09.629> butts

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
display or i call it display butts

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.399 
display or i call it display butts
you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.400> pull<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.540> functions<00:02:12.959> whatever<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
you can pull the functions whatever you

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.819 
you can pull the functions whatever you
want<00:02:13.849> it's<00:02:15.019> just<00:02:16.019> as<00:02:16.140> long<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.500> use<00:02:16.530> them

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
want it's just as long as you use them

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.740 
want it's just as long as you use them
correctly<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.310> okay<00:02:17.609> i<00:02:17.819> call<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.329> display

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
correctly it's okay i call it display

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.699 
correctly it's okay i call it display
anyway<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:20.840> basically<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.349> used<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
anyway and basically it is used to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.229 
anyway and basically it is used to
display<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.640> want<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.000> screen

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
display what if you want on the screen

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.729 
display what if you want on the screen
to<00:02:25.170> render<00:02:25.469> to<00:02:25.650> draw<00:02:25.829> whatever<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.280> want<00:02:26.489> and

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
to render to draw whatever you want and

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.660 
to render to draw whatever you want and
supposing<00:02:28.739> you're<00:02:28.950> using<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.430> minesweeper

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
supposing you're using a minesweeper

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.580 
supposing you're using a minesweeper
which<00:02:30.150> will<00:02:30.299> do<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.889> it<00:02:31.889> will<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:33.590> would

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
which will do is it will it would

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.179 
which will do is it will it would
basically<00:02:35.280> draw<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.819> minefield<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.780> mines

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
basically draw the minefield the mines

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.009 
basically draw the minefield the mines
the<00:02:38.189> numbers<00:02:38.609> or<00:02:38.939> depending<00:02:39.299> on<00:02:39.389> situation<00:02:39.540> so

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
the numbers or depending on situation so

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.259 
the numbers or depending on situation so
that's<00:02:40.200> why<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.379> have<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> code<00:02:41.430> each

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
that's why you have to code each

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.339 
that's why you have to code each
function<00:02:42.930> correctly<00:02:44.720> next<00:02:45.720> function<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.169> call

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
function correctly next function I call

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.170 
function correctly next function I call
it<00:02:46.379> updates<00:02:46.859> you<00:02:47.099> can<00:02:47.280> call<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.669> whatever<00:02:48.000> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it updates you can call it whatever you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.399 
it updates you can call it whatever you
want<00:02:48.419> like<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.109> said<00:02:49.349> before<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:51.409> basically

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
want like I said before and basically

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.220 
want like I said before and basically
this<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.859> unit<00:02:53.370> function<00:02:53.700> which<00:02:53.849> uses<00:02:54.359> events

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this is unit function which uses events

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.970 
this is unit function which uses events
while<00:02:55.680> which<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:56.069> which<00:02:56.879> has<00:02:57.060> arguments

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
while which is which has arguments

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.490 
while which is which has arguments
because<00:02:59.000> it's<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.540> actually<00:03:01.079> takes<00:03:01.260> into

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
because it's it actually takes into

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.259 
because it's it actually takes into
account<00:03:01.530> some<00:03:02.689> variables<00:03:03.689> which<00:03:04.019> will<00:03:04.469> be

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
account some variables which will be

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.909 
account some variables which will be
defined<00:03:06.269> by<00:03:06.389> OS<00:03:06.750> dr.<00:03:07.079> Levin<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.469> the<00:03:07.560> function

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
defined by OS dr. Levin to the function

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.270 
defined by OS dr. Levin to the function
OS<00:03:08.310> Bullivant<00:03:09.290> what<00:03:10.290> update<00:03:10.680> does<00:03:10.919> is<00:03:11.159> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
OS Bullivant what update does is it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.680 
OS Bullivant what update does is it
basically<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:12.599> will<00:03:13.109> do<00:03:13.829> all<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.569> calculus<00:03:15.569> oh

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
basically it will do all the calculus oh

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.219 
basically it will do all the calculus oh
it<00:03:16.019> will<00:03:16.199> manage<00:03:16.949> over<00:03:17.220> game<00:03:17.400> logic<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.199> is

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
it will manage over game logic so it is

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.379 
it will manage over game logic so it is
pretty<00:03:19.859> much<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.099> most<00:03:20.549> important<00:03:21.060> function

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
pretty much the most important function

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:28.369 
pretty much the most important function
in<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.690> game<00:03:23.780> yes<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:26.780> yeah<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.229> when

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
in the game yes it is and yeah but when

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.920 
in the game yes it is and yeah but when
bats<00:03:28.620> well<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.549> yes<00:03:30.449> the<00:03:30.599> last<00:03:30.720> function

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
bats well it's a yes the last function

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.140 
bats well it's a yes the last function
is<00:03:31.290> what<00:03:31.889> i<00:03:31.919> call<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.250> end<00:03:32.459> game<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:34.650> is

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
is what i call it end game and this is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.580 
is what i call it end game and this is
basically<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.329> total<00:03:36.689> opposite<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.079> in<00:03:37.409> it's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
basically the total opposite of in it's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.740 
basically the total opposite of in it's
basically<00:03:37.979> it<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> function<00:03:39.299> which<00:03:39.479> will<00:03:39.659> be

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
basically it is a function which will be

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.259 
basically it is a function which will be
called<00:03:39.930> at<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.229> end<00:03:40.409> of<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> game<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:42.060> will<00:03:42.209> be

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
called at the end of the game it will be

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.949 
called at the end of the game it will be
calling<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.780> once<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.319> this<00:03:44.159> is<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:45.359> could

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
calling you once and this is it it could

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.719 
calling you once and this is it it could
be<00:03:46.109> used<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.530> say<00:03:46.709> i<00:03:46.739> don't<00:03:46.919> know<00:03:47.069> like<00:03:47.220> goodbye

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
be used to say i don't know like goodbye

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:52.039 
be used to say i don't know like goodbye
or<00:03:48.120> whatever<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.810> want<00:03:49.759> usually<00:03:50.759> I<00:03:50.790> use<00:03:51.419> end

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
or whatever you want usually I use end

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.050 
or whatever you want usually I use end
game<00:03:52.259> and<00:03:52.470> then<00:03:52.620> display<00:03:53.099> for<00:03:53.759> example

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
game and then display for example

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.379 
game and then display for example
minesweeper<00:03:54.659> it<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:54.989> air<00:03:55.199> end<00:03:55.620> game<00:03:55.889> I<00:03:56.269> use<00:03:57.269> it

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
minesweeper it or air end game I use it

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.689 
minesweeper it or air end game I use it
to<00:03:57.419> reveal<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.109> minds<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.560> display<00:03:59.250> one<00:03:59.459> last

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
to reveal the minds and display one last

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.179 
to reveal the minds and display one last
time<00:03:59.939> so<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.199> can<00:04:01.470> actually<00:04:01.680> see<00:04:01.859> the

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
time so that you can actually see the

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.830 
time so that you can actually see the
mines<00:04:02.400> on<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.759> minefield<00:04:03.150> where<00:04:03.419> every

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
mines on the minefield where every

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.550 
mines on the minefield where every
single<00:04:04.079> one<00:04:04.199> of<00:04:04.229> them<00:04:04.409> was<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.790> now<00:04:06.379> so<00:04:07.379> there's

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
single one of them was so now so there's

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.929 
single one of them was so now so there's
all<00:04:07.680> all<00:04:07.859> four<00:04:08.129> functions<00:04:08.930> now<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.939> let's

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
all all four functions now then let's

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.449 
all all four functions now then let's
start<00:04:12.209> with<00:04:12.299> extra<00:04:12.569> actual<00:04:13.139> game<00:04:13.799> loop<00:04:14.069> first

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
start with extra actual game loop first

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.029 
start with extra actual game loop first
we're<00:04:14.579> going<00:04:14.669> to<00:04:14.759> do<00:04:14.879> is<00:04:15.030> called<00:04:15.299> in<00:04:15.509> it<00:04:16.039> like

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
we're going to do is called in it like

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.140 
we're going to do is called in it like
that<00:04:17.250> and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
that and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.939 
that and
declare<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.509> new<00:04:18.600> variable<00:04:18.630> let's<00:04:19.620> call<00:04:19.829> it

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
declare a new variable let's call it

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.099 
declare a new variable let's call it
count<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.519> call<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.000> can't<00:04:21.269> vicar<00:04:21.479> as<00:04:21.900> in

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
count I call it can't vicar as in

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.770 
count I call it can't vicar as in
continue<00:04:22.699> it<00:04:23.699> has<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.970> be<00:04:24.060> initialized<00:04:24.540> to

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
continue it has to be initialized to

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.490 
continue it has to be initialized to
true<00:04:25.490> when<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.610> open<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.210> loop<00:04:27.570> while<00:04:28.500> can't<00:04:29.360> do

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
true when you open a loop while can't do

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.570 
true when you open a loop while can't do
go<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.560> them<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:33.560> basically<00:04:34.560> well<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
go to them and basically well the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.790 
go to them and basically well the
variable<00:04:35.940> count<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.300> true<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:37.320> game<00:04:37.500> will<00:04:37.680> go

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
variable count is true the game will go

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.999 
variable count is true the game will go
on<00:04:37.979> if<00:04:38.160> contigo<00:04:38.669> false<00:04:39.000> game<00:04:39.270> will<00:04:39.449> end<00:04:40.009> so

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
on if contigo false game will end so

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.850 
on if contigo false game will end so
that's<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:42.320> first<00:04:43.320> thing<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.470> want<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.680> do

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
that's that first thing you want to do

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.100 
that's that first thing you want to do
envelope<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.370> called<00:04:44.580> display<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.210> so

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
envelope is called display and so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.529 
envelope is called display and so
basically<00:04:46.259> each<00:04:46.770> tick<00:04:47.220> every<00:04:47.490> time<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.360> go

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
basically each tick every time you go

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.600 
basically each tick every time you go
through<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> loop<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.380> what<00:04:49.650> redisplay

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
through the loop it what redisplay

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.330 
through the loop it what redisplay
whatever<00:04:51.449> has<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.630> be<00:04:51.750> displayed<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:53.660> then

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
whatever has to be displayed and then

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.600 
whatever has to be displayed and then
you<00:04:56.340> want<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.699> use<00:04:56.880> OS<00:04:57.060> double<00:04:57.539> event<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:59.580> you

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
you want to use OS double event so you

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.650 
you want to use OS double event so you
have<00:04:59.850> to<00:04:59.970> declare<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.300> few<00:05:00.419> variables<00:05:00.660> e<00:05:02.000> a1<00:05:03.000> a2

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
have to declare a few variables e a1 a2

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.840 
have to declare a few variables e a1 a2
a3<00:05:04.789> this<00:05:05.789> is<00:05:05.940> how<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.120> usually<00:05:06.389> call<00:05:06.840> them<00:05:07.850> equal

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
a3 this is how I usually call them equal

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.850 
a3 this is how I usually call them equal
0<00:05:09.000> s<00:05:09.180> dot<00:05:09.479> pull<00:05:10.410> event<00:05:12.650> as<00:05:13.910> fat<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.650> let<00:05:16.650> me

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
0 s dot pull event as fat and let me

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.969 
0 s dot pull event as fat and let me
give<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:17.130> one<00:05:17.160> little<00:05:17.460> detail<00:05:17.699> but<00:05:18.030> update

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
give you one little detail but update

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.310 
give you one little detail but update
basically<00:05:19.979> update<00:05:20.370> also<00:05:20.940> in<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.810> case<00:05:21.960> River

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
basically update also in the case River

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.050 
basically update also in the case River
game<00:05:22.560> has<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.860> end<00:05:22.889> all<00:05:23.220> not<00:05:23.400> by<00:05:23.669> returning

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
game has to end all not by returning

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.050 
game has to end all not by returning
true<00:05:24.360> or<00:05:24.449> false<00:05:24.630> if<00:05:25.010> update<00:05:26.010> returns<00:05:26.370> true<00:05:26.789> it

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
true or false if update returns true it

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.240 
true or false if update returns true it
means<00:05:27.419> with<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.690> game<00:05:27.960> must<00:05:28.139> end<00:05:28.440> if<00:05:28.710> it

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
means with the game must end if it

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.270 
means with the game must end if it
returns<00:05:29.370> false<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:31.260> game<00:05:31.650> can<00:05:31.770> continue<00:05:32.250> so

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
returns false the game can continue so

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.860 
returns false the game can continue so
if<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.580> do<00:05:32.760> if<00:05:34.460> updates<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:36.530> will<00:05:38.870> basically

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
if you do if updates it will basically

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.710 
if you do if updates it will basically
check<00:05:40.590> if<00:05:40.949> game<00:05:41.490> has<00:05:41.639> to<00:05:41.760> end<00:05:41.789> or<00:05:42.030> not<00:05:44.449> so<00:05:45.449> if

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
check if game has to end or not so if

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.420 
check if game has to end or not so if
update<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:46.320> put<00:05:46.470> true<00:05:46.770> them<00:05:47.010> into<00:05:47.250> game<00:05:47.400> has

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
update you put true them into game has

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.750 
update you put true them into game has
to<00:05:47.669> end<00:05:47.699> like<00:05:47.909> I<00:05:48.120> said<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:49.080> we<00:05:49.169> do<00:05:49.289> count<00:05:49.760> equal

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
to end like I said so we do count equal

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.029 
to end like I said so we do count equal
false<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:51.900> rule<00:05:52.110> allowed<00:05:52.409> to<00:05:52.680> exit<00:05:52.949> the

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
false and this rule allowed to exit the

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.589 
false and this rule allowed to exit the
loop<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:54.620> so<00:05:55.620> there<00:05:55.830> that's<00:05:56.760> the<00:05:57.000> main<00:05:57.389> loop

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
loop and so there that's the main loop

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.500 
loop and so there that's the main loop
and<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:58.349> course<00:05:58.530> you<00:05:58.590> have<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.740> add<00:05:58.949> endgame

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
and of course you have to add endgame

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.649 
and of course you have to add endgame
and<00:06:01.580> how<00:06:02.580> about<00:06:02.639> display<00:06:03.800> one<00:06:04.800> last<00:06:04.979> time<00:06:05.659> of

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
and how about display one last time of

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.909 
and how about display one last time of
course<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.020> can<00:06:07.169> add<00:06:07.320> a<00:06:07.349> whole<00:06:07.620> bunch<00:06:07.680> of

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
course you can add a whole bunch of

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.350 
course you can add a whole bunch of
other<00:06:07.979> things<00:06:08.550> in<00:06:08.729> VN<00:06:08.909> like<00:06:09.090> saying<00:06:09.330> goodbye

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
other things in VN like saying goodbye

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.080 
other things in VN like saying goodbye
or<00:06:10.699> in<00:06:11.699> fact<00:06:12.180> what<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.449> can<00:06:12.630> do<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:13.760> do<00:06:14.760> another

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
or in fact what you can do is do another

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.159 
or in fact what you can do is do another
loop<00:06:15.360> which<00:06:16.020> would<00:06:16.289> have<00:06:17.070> all<00:06:17.340> of<00:06:17.610> this<00:06:18.169> this

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
loop which would have all of this this

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.830 
loop which would have all of this this
whole<00:06:19.409> pot<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.919> basically<00:06:20.789> if<00:06:21.240> we<00:06:21.389> can<00:06:21.570> use<00:06:21.690> it

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
whole pot and basically if we can use it

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.890 
whole pot and basically if we can use it
is

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
is

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.330 
is
the<00:06:24.830> first<00:06:25.100> loop<00:06:25.340> here<00:06:25.910> what<00:06:26.240> is<00:06:26.449> as<00:06:27.190> long<00:06:28.190> as

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
the first loop here what is as long as

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.939 
the first loop here what is as long as
you<00:06:28.460> want<00:06:28.669> to<00:06:28.820> play<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.120> game<00:06:29.500> keep<00:06:30.500> on<00:06:30.710> and

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
you want to play the game keep on and

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.439 
you want to play the game keep on and
everyone<00:06:31.280> is<00:06:31.520> as<00:06:31.699> long<00:06:31.880> as<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.150> game<00:06:32.300> is

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
everyone is as long as the game is
