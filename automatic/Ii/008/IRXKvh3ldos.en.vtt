00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.900
 it is actually important that you do that 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.680
 Customer clean pieces available 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.080
 put that clean and cut 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.390
 It is important that it is also a small one 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.970
 bit of symmetry is around the symmetry 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.450
 to produce here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.879
 not that always settle so i here 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.250
 the cut line that I reach 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.970
 just want to show that I called 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.150
 doing here with the razor nick on 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.880
 that's on the world on both sides 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:56.370
 almost the same look and have 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.370
 if I take the saw then 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.100
 I can do here with the non-saw to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.100
 interpret 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.560
 on both sides that one here that one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560
 here 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:42.710
 so I have two in any case 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:49.140
 clean cuts and you can see here 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.869
 an absolutely clean graduation one 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 There are absolutely no edges in here you have 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.940
 I do not even tear myself the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.399
 finger advised 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.090
 hear me from many picture we trade 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:07.830
 say this saw a season in use 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.350
 then it paid off 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.090
 In fact, so many wild traders 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.910
 the flying places on the tracks 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.550
 drive and pick up there always wild 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.480
 regret that they have to pay 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.630
 what they actually do afterwards 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.630
 throw it away 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.180
 if the wild hitler made such a saw of 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.579
 he is without us on the car 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 Another capable of the 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.230
 scare place today overwhelmingly 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.260
 hanging pieces or lying pieces 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.070
 judging on the track and inside 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.120
 to be able to make cuts in it 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.780
 there the shot the bad parts at 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.900
 stretch out already take place 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.870
 this is usually not because that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.600
 piece either hangs or lies and one 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.680
 on the spot no possibility has the ribs 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.410
 so to separate by 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.510
 that you do not buy the piece 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.810
 want or what is anyway away 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.400
 must be lonely stretch make space 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.680
 So you have to be in this case 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.510
 imagine that the piece is stretched 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.790
 yes, yes, too 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.430
 it is possible to examine without one 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.750
 Another with now he does not see any 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.769
 piece has such a good shot as 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.940
 this piece here that one here 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.470
 cut out in principle 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:40.310
 First, if you continue to rip 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:40.310
 the sail wants to process 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.610
 cut this straight line again like us 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.380
 have already seen him perform here 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:02.770
 and then you have to 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:05.260
 Of course you can do everything without further ado 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.320
 see that here again a straight 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.600
 piece has will that want the pieces 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.150
 clean can process and 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.150
 then cut well too 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.810
 you can or you can just as well 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.810
 imagine 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.940
 That's why you have to saw a saw, of course 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:35.680
 so that you can shoot that 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:39.840
 bad here, without further ado 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.700
 can cut and thus these pieces 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:51.090
 which can be used for world and clean 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:54.490
 in the meat industry at the counters 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:59.400
 third, as a rule , it is so that the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:04.090
 end stage of the stripe is not there yet 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.550
 so you clean the pieces here as well 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.550
 then can cut to the packaging 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:44.289
 As a rule , one does not suffer these sounds 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:54.840
 scheel rib solar masses complete 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:54.840
 belly so that you without problems 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.729
 clean cuts on the pieces of 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.729
 can lead 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.940
 Often I am asked by customers what 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.090
 Can I cut that with the saw ? 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.180
 have to cut from the back soils 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.159
 we just demonstrated that but that is 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.389
 Not everything I am with 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:28.659
 can make saw if wants to be disassembled 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:32.440
 at higher bones home when I hear 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.800
 bone the good bone marrow out cook 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.740
 want 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.780
 It is important that you still immediately 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.949
 be opened so that the cooking water 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.080
 also on 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:45.789
 that may be the bone and that 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.259
 again i want to show you how to do it 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.750
 that can also do with this saw 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.729
 This saw actually only has one 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.610
 incision depth of 3 cm 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:58.949
 but that is completely enough 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:02.229
 tubular bones this to saw to 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:04.000
 I use the saw in reverse 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.629
 women that means I take the switch 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.629
 up 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:11.319
 the bone as right-handed in the 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:14.620
 left hand and read the lake went lege 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:23.380
 Bone on bones and turn 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:27.729
 something and again fall important 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:31.599
 is that one of the bones in fresh 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:33.849
 the inarticulate that they slip a bit when 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.889
 maybe a better stop 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:38.310
 to have 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.310
 to let 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:50.860
 we are without effort 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.860
 cuts the saw
