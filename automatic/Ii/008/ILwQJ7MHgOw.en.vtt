00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 or the people of youtube are me and I'm going to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.799
 teach now how to assemble the rubik cube of 2 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 x 2 is much easier than a rubik cube 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:18.390
 of 3 x 3 and I also tell them that it is not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.880
 different to arm this one here because it's 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.200
 as if we were putting together 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 practically the corners of this cube 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.030
 from here if you do not know armed 3 x 3 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.480
 I recommend you go to the next 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.189
 link that will appear on your screen 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.610
 because there are movements that you should 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.150
 learn to be able to put these cubes together 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.150
 what 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 something that you should keep in mind for 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.400
 Arming this 2 by 2 is that as it does not have 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.620
 centers you have to remember that the white 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.160
 the yellow is always behind 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.490
 orange is always behind the red and the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.650
 always central blue is the green 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.430
 ok it's not so clear we can already 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.430
 put together the club 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.530
 although having our cube disarmed 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.659
 let's make the white face ok 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.540
 take this piece as a reference that is 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.790
 the orange and the green 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.970
 let's find another target here but that 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.390
 have a green here is 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 we're going to put it right below that 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 piece we're going to want to put here 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 to move it like that but without losing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.170
 here we are going to save it like this 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.180
 We had it like this and we integrated it again 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 the green that we already have our two 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.700
 green with white now we want to have 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.210
 a red here and a white that we look for 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.180
 here it is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.140
 we're going to put our below where the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 we want to place ok to move this here 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.220
 without losing these 12 here we'll go 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.880
 to save like this we have this and we do not see 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.960
 this way 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.860
 we already have the red 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.620
 Now let's put a blue and an orange that 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.530
 It is the last piece that releases us 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.270
 we 're going to put it right down where 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.760
 we want to place but now there is the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.710
 backwards we are going to do the same thing but let's go 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.220
 to do it otherwise 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.800
 we're going to save them like that and there's the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.580
 we will go up here to later integrate and 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:42.590
 this here is worth we have the white face 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.420
 it will be our base we are going to put it like this 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.239
 here we only want to have a 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.940
 yellow here I have it you can 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.920
 have two or so or so 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.360
 or flatly have none for that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.430
 serves the next algorithm that I'm going 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.680
 to give 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.810
 I already have this here I'm going to put it 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.409
 in its color that is orange and blue 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.409
 A) Yes 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.840
 and good if you have two so all 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.640
 so I recommend that you do not have 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 no yellow for example that what 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.420
 have thus not 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.519
 because because they are going to do the algorithm 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.420
 in a circle and they will not do anything 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.670
 and they're only going to be like that 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.540
 and the only yellow will not come out 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.930
 what we want to have here 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.989
 well, having this, let's do the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.989
 next algorithm that is l prima 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.319
 r his cousin l 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.140
 and the cousin 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.970
 this until we get all the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.630
 yellows from here 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.630
 OK 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.610
 I already have two blues here we are going to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.340
 put here 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.890
 you the colors that match them 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:03.310
 can have this case or this case 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.690
 If so, diagonally, they will have 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.970
 to be the same one that I'm going to teach 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.430
 now twice if I have it if I 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.900
 they have as well as I have it then 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.720
 they will only do it once ok 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.329
 having the cube like that with a l here 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.510
 in front they will be next to 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.510
 beautiful 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:31.360
 r all times r premium or bonus r 12 times 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.360
 l prima 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:37.429
 r premium or premium 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.400
 and ready 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.490
 the cube rubik 2 x 2 is armed is 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.980
 quite simple compared to this 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.050
 from here but it's a matter of practice 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.770
 friend 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.099
 good 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.569
 If you have any questions or suggestions, you can 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.499
 put a comment 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.380
 or if you want to be able to give me an answer 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.120
 in video 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.150
 Well, I can respond to the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.580
 brevity ok 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.850
 my name is joe and we'll see each other 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.850
 video
