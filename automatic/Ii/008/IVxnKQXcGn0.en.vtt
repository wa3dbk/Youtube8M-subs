00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
same it just depends on the size or

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.480 
same it just depends on the size or
shape<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.260> your<00:02:31.380> head<00:02:32.780> liner<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.960> removable

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
shape of your head liner is removable

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.530 
shape of your head liner is removable
which<00:02:35.490> means<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.180> get<00:02:36.300> rid<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
which means that you can get rid of that

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.130 
which means that you can get rid of that
head<00:02:36.780> funk<00:02:37.020> after<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.380> while<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:40.760> overall<00:02:41.760> I

head funk after a while and overall I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.870 
head funk after a while and overall I
like<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> way<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.500> goes<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:43.980> out<00:02:44.040> snaps

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
like the way it goes in and out snaps

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.700 
like the way it goes in and out snaps
it's<00:02:45.630> very<00:02:45.840> good

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
it's very good

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.700 
it's very good
the<00:02:47.100> bend<00:02:47.280> controls<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> stealth

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
the bend controls just like the stealth

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.530 
the bend controls just like the stealth
they're<00:02:50.010> hidden<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.520> like<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.150> look<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.510> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
they're hidden I like that look on a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750 
they're hidden I like that look on a

all you do is switch that back and forth

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
little bit susceptible to breaking I've

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.270

never seen one break but they do look a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
little flimsy who knows if they're gonna

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.320 
little flimsy who knows if they're gonna
break<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.680> not<00:03:22.800> especially<00:03:23.040> gloves<00:03:23.610> I'm<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
break or not especially gloves I'm a

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.990 
break or not especially gloves I'm a
little<00:03:24.570> careful<00:03:24.870> with<00:03:24.959> mine<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.820> don't

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
little careful with mine so I don't

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000 
little careful with mine so I don't
break<00:03:27.150> up<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.910> actual<00:03:30.320> visor<00:03:31.320> system<00:03:31.890> is

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
break up the actual visor system is

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.100 
break up the actual visor system is
quite<00:03:32.519> nice

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
quite nice

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.690 
quite nice
this<00:03:34.110> opens<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:34.800> too<00:03:34.980> far<00:03:35.250> for<00:03:35.280> my

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
this opens a little too far for my

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.630 
this opens a little too far for my
liking<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:37.170> get<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> little<00:03:37.620> too<00:03:37.739> much<00:03:37.890> wind<00:03:38.160> at

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
liking you get a little too much wind at

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.449 
liking you get a little too much wind at
your<00:03:38.700> typical<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.560> city<00:03:40.800> speeds<00:03:41.160> without

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
your typical in the city speeds without

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.910 
your typical in the city speeds without
eggs<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.060> right<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.660> getting<00:03:43.650> bugs<00:03:43.800> to

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
eggs in it right up and getting bugs to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.479 
eggs in it right up and getting bugs to
the<00:03:43.980> face

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
the face

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.880 
the face
so<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:47.600> system<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.690> exactly<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.320> same<00:03:49.530> as<00:03:49.860> a

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
so the system is exactly the same as a

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.449 
so the system is exactly the same as a
stealth<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:51.720> basically<00:03:52.140> put<00:03:53.010> your<00:03:53.160> finger<00:03:53.430> on

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
stealth you basically put your finger on

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.000 
stealth you basically put your finger on
this<00:03:53.610> little<00:03:53.880> lever<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.840> got<00:03:55.019> little<00:03:55.680> teeth

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
this little lever it's got little teeth

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.110 
this little lever it's got little teeth
on<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:56.850> one<00:03:57.000> you're

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
on it so you can see which one you're

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.050 
on it so you can see which one you're
pushing<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.070> push<00:03:59.760> on<00:03:59.910> that

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
pushing on and you just push on that

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.790 
pushing on and you just push on that
visor<00:04:00.480> pop<00:04:00.840> sauce<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.260> I'm<00:04:01.350> not<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.709> do

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
visor pop sauce so I'm not going to do

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.920 
visor pop sauce so I'm not going to do
that<00:04:01.980> that's<00:04:02.760> been<00:04:03.030> done<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.209> other<00:04:03.450> reviews

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
that that's been done on other reviews

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.500 
that that's been done on other reviews
and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
and

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.260 
and
so<00:04:06.740> this<00:04:07.740> visor<00:04:07.950> comes<00:04:08.370> from<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.880> factory

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
so this visor comes from the factory

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.750 
so this visor comes from the factory
with<00:04:09.360> race<00:04:09.840> tear<00:04:10.140> offs<00:04:10.350> this<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.490> a<00:04:11.520> race

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760
