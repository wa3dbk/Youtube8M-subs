00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
class I'm going to go over the DLC and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.559 
class I'm going to go over the DLC and
you'll<00:03:09.720> see<00:03:09.900> here<00:03:10.280> data<00:03:11.280> meters<00:03:11.730> which<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.359> did

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
you'll see here data meters which I did

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.740 
you'll see here data meters which I did
not<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.840> perform<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.909> what<00:03:15.209> I'll<00:03:15.299> do<00:03:15.540> is

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
not have perform and so what I'll do is

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.569 
not have perform and so what I'll do is
I'm<00:03:16.500> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.799> put<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.579> my<00:03:17.639> gun<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:19.579> now

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
I'm going to put that on my gun and now

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.030 
I'm going to put that on my gun and now
all<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.879> do<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:23.090> sign<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.650> second

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
all I do is sign out of the second

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.250 
all I do is sign out of the second
controller<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:31.019> there<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:31.919> go<00:03:31.949> that's<00:03:32.669> done

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
controller so there we go that's done

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.449 
controller so there we go that's done
some<00:03:34.260> reason<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> sign<00:03:34.859> me<00:03:35.010> out<00:03:35.040> as<00:03:35.310> well<00:03:35.340> I

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
some reason to sign me out as well I

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.619 
some reason to sign me out as well I
think<00:03:35.729> I<00:03:36.049> didn't<00:03:37.049> write<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.799> then<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.629> there

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
think I didn't write and then just there

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.039 
think I didn't write and then just there
you<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:39.930> controls<00:03:40.680> gone<00:03:41.750> now<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.840> we're<00:03:42.930> going

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
you go controls gone now if we're going

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.789 
you go controls gone now if we're going
to<00:03:43.109> pull<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.379> much<00:03:43.560> create-a-class<00:03:45.799> still

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
to pull it much create-a-class still

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.890 
to pull it much create-a-class still
there<00:03:47.010> I'm<00:03:47.909> going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.150> select<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.690> and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
there I'm going to select that and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.599 
there I'm going to select that and
hopefully<00:03:49.560> if<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.859> go<00:03:49.979> into<00:03:50.099> custom<00:03:50.459> game

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
hopefully if I go into custom game

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.189 
hopefully if I go into custom game
quickly<00:03:51.229> it'll<00:03:52.229> have<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.310> option<00:03:54.109> so<00:03:55.109> I'll

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
quickly it'll have the option so I'll

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.890 
quickly it'll have the option so I'll
just<00:03:55.319> put<00:03:55.439> on<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> sniper<00:03:56.010> class<00:03:56.659> there<00:03:57.659> it<00:03:57.750> is

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
just put on the sniper class there it is

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.780 
just put on the sniper class there it is
died<00:03:58.229> animators<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.069> what<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> do<00:03:59.340> quickly<00:03:59.939> is

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
died animators so what I do quickly is

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.219 
died animators so what I do quickly is
I've<00:04:02.790> set<00:04:03.299> up<00:04:03.329> some<00:04:03.419> bots<00:04:03.720> go<00:04:04.019> into<00:04:04.199> a
