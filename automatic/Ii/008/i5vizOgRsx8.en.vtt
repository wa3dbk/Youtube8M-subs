00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.110 

this<00:00:53.489> car<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.199> 100%<00:00:55.199> stock<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this car is 100% stock as you see it the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
this car is 100% stock as you see it the
only<00:00:57.300> aftermarket<00:00:57.989> product<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
only aftermarket product here is the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.340 
only aftermarket product here is the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.680 
black kidney grilles in the front which
I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.909> enhances<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:03.030> look<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.359> car<00:01:03.570> on

I think enhances the look at the car on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.880 
I think enhances the look at the car on
the<00:01:03.780> sport<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> does<00:01:04.619> match<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the sport because it does match the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
the sport because it does match the
shadow<00:01:05.309> line<00:01:05.519> trim<00:01:05.850> around<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> windows<00:01:06.600> just
