00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
then we're going to place the fish skin

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
then we're going to place the fish skin
side<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:53.570> hot<00:00:54.570> pan<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.039> key<00:00:56.219> you

this<00:01:24.820> fish<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:26.380> only<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.800> versatile<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.730> a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
this fish not only is it versatile in a

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.820 
this fish not only is it versatile in a
way<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.300> can<00:01:28.480> cook<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.710> many

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
way that you can cook it so many

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.000 
way that you can cook it so many
different<00:01:30.220> methods<00:01:30.340> it's<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:31.000> fish<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:32.010> for

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.740 
different methods it's a fish that for
some<00:01:33.190> reason<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:34.090> know<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.450> it's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
some reason you can you know it's it's

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.660 
some reason you can you know it's it's
delicate<00:01:35.260> but<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.470> can<00:01:35.590> take<00:01:35.770> big<00:01:36.010> flavors<00:01:36.520> as

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
delicate but it can take big flavors as

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.090 
delicate but it can take big flavors as
well<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.240> when<00:01:37.450> we<00:01:37.570> when<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.350> think<00:01:38.680> about<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
well so when we when I think about the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190 
well so when we when I think about the
fish<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.490> think<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.910> it's<00:01:40.060> there's<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:40.990> many

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
fish I think that it's there's so many

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.380 
fish I think that it's there's so many
styles<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:41.890> can<00:01:42.040> actually<00:01:42.160> cook<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.730> if

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
styles that I can actually cook this if

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.450 
styles that I can actually cook this if
I<00:01:43.570> want<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:43.960> be<00:01:44.230> big<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.680> bold<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.310> big

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
tomato so the bullier based sauce is

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.830 
tomato so the bullier based sauce is
going<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.610> hold<00:01:48.790> up<00:01:48.940> beautifully<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.600> that

it's a relatively easy fish to cook it
retains<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.570> moisture<00:02:04.720> some<00:02:05.470> fish<00:02:05.770> when<00:02:05.950> you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
retains the moisture some fish when you

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.609 
retains the moisture some fish when you
cook<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.460> it's<00:02:07.030> very<00:02:07.300> difficult<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.260> get<00:02:08.410> that

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
cook it it's very difficult to get that

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.650 
cook it it's very difficult to get that
you<00:02:09.040> know<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> get<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.490> cooking<00:02:09.850> quite<00:02:10.360> you

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
you know to get that cooking quite you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.780 
you know to get that cooking quite you
know<00:02:10.690> perfectly<00:02:11.350> cooked<00:02:11.680> because<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.610> not

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
know perfectly cooked because it's not

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.130 
know perfectly cooked because it's not
cooked<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.209> not<00:02:13.360> cooked<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.750> its<00:02:13.900> dry

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
cooked it's not cooked in its dry

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.380 
cooked it's not cooked in its dry
whereas<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.340> quite<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> forgiving<00:02:16.120> fish

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
whereas this is a quite a forgiving fish

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.080 
whereas this is a quite a forgiving fish
so<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.560> holds<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.130> moisture<00:02:18.610> for<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:18.940> you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
so it holds that moisture for you so you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.940 
so it holds that moisture for you so you
can<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.540> mean<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.320> cook<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.560> where<00:02:20.800> it's
