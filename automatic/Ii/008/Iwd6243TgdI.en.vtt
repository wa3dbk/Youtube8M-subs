00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.109
 Hello everyone, today we have a small 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.860
 video review comparative video review 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.349
 phones redmi 2 readme 1s 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's compare yes it's a phone he 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.480
 first 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:28.730
 in appearance by body as seen 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 rhythm 2 has become a little less than redmi 1c 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:41.030
 so it's in front so let's see why 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.940
 phones what is tatyana when we have 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.760
 the thickness of the phones is practically not 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.239
 thickness has changed there and there approximately 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.239
 equally 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 It is clearly seen that we redmi 2 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.360
 the phone has become smaller 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.030
 so back 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.890
 So, let's behind things so we 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 difference 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.770
 the back cover here is soft touch but here 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.369
 fingers remain more than covered 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.950
 rhythm 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.200
 but the main difference remains less 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.390
 here on the LED flash she 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.490
 moved to the left side here is the floor below 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.050
 here the speaker and here respectively not 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.690
 hint I want to say that here 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.930
 speaker salon is bigger and this one sounds 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:46.440
 phone at redmi 2 we have a better way 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.080
 side compare here we have nothing 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:57.970
 so below is comparable that is principled 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:04.050
 too fun here in the middle of blah 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:10.060
 micro beaten here came to right 40 so 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:17.140
 in appearance everything seems to be what you want 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:20.709
 say here and there that is a row of mi-2 and and 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.420
 rhythm 1s lower buttons there and there not 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.080
 highlighted so I want. say by 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.030
 appearance 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.030
 rhythm 2 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.980
 this is my personal opinion of course 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.280
 phone has become more rounded that is at 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:46.860
 the garden we acquired more feminine traits 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.110
 It seems to me more focused on 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.830
 female audience that is on for 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.640
 buyers 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.880
 for women, especially in her back cover 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.860
 are changing 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.709
 changing to a pink white light i mean i 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.310
 I think that redmi 2 is even more suitable 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:12.220
 for girls for women than phone glad 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.290
 her 1c he is so brutal square 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.910
 more fly phone well this is of course 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:23.530
 purely my personal opinion so let's go 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:31.590
 now for the iron of the phones here too 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:35.610
 more differences a little bit here 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.910
 8 megapixel main camera here 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.700
 also an 8 megapixel front camera 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:50.519
 here 2 megapixels 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:53.819
 here 1 and 3 here wolkonsky processor 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:58.610
 snapdragon 410 in exchange with here 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:06.030
 snapdragon 400 well, as I understand that although 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:10.680
 here x on rhythm 2 how much is 410 for you 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.510
 but according to the indicators they say that he will 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.690
 worse than except he is 400 well 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:24.389
 speak on means on sure how it all 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:33.440
 we really have a proprietary shell from here 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:37.800
 cute in 5 so here we have 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.880
 so here we have branded shell 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:47.419
 exchanged here at least 5 well 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.070
 you need their comparison quran and principle 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.820
 screens 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.820
 both the phone is very good 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:04.350
 the screen stayed the same 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.610
 good so what else can you say about 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:14.820
 these phones are about 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.480
 batteries here redmi 2 fish for us 2200 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.450
 milliampere 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:32.080
 batteries let's see them take off 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:36.689
 back cover of the phone so 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.159
 so the covers are removed easily both cases 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:50.639
 so it looks like this 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:57.000
 then our phones like this 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:59.550
 I said that the speaker redmi 2 more 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:12.210
 study well, respectively, better 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:12.210
 so with her batteries batteries with them and 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:27.449
 let's see them compare batteries the same 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.449
 that is, the battery remains the same 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:36.669
 So 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:49.910
 that's the way we put the batteries 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:07:01.820
 the phone closes back 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:07:02.930
 already good fast that way so about 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:08.200
 phone quality 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:11.030
 he and quality as they say on top 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.800
 reliable and high-quality stocks Phones 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.890
 you can summarize 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:26.950
 like that despite the fact that 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:29.390
 we have a redmi 2 phone in 1s rhythm 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.320
 despite this she did not lose her 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:37.120
 relevance in this way and what else 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.230
 I wanted to say I forgot here with us 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:44.890
 3g support 

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:48.970
 here we have 4 through the network and therefore 

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:54.920
 the difference is in difference as they say 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:58.430
 saw it yourself you decide what plan 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:02.060
 phone like order this 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:04.420
