00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 mssingen and acts here full of jim 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.490
 I really appreciated it here 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:14.250
 ask the people yes that was my love 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.400
 girlfriend and today I'm doing that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.420
 a small cinema and video first 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.010
 I have never done that and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
 Secondly, there are extremely many questions 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.029
 extremely often and therefore offers 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.070
 so a format I think honestly am 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.189
 currently still in südtirol go to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 Hebler to Munich 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 tomorrow the highway probably 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.860
 I am extremely exhausted and there I am 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.899
 thought fast a video 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.610
 The most common question would be hard to believe 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.690
 The comments in the comments is like 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.000
 old are you I became 26 years 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 first 10 88 26 years 26 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 if interested I've just am 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.250
 the beginning of the channel is now a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.949
 few months made videos on the subject 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.120
 my education uni wc3 when i do that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.199
 i was interested in jackson 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 try to link 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.909
 26 years all new 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.799
 ask number two actually what 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.590
 pretty general theme supplements 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.450
 I get extremely ask many people in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 start training and do not know 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.509
 which protein powder which creatine 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.820
 or what booster they buy 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.619
 should have started before 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 to train 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.930
 Just give a general answer in 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.189
 him no supplements and mine 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.479
 opinion, supplements also belong 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.950
 not to the net ray bodybuilding exactly 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 how steroids are not part of that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.579
 I can not give you an answer 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.829
 and honestly , he did not feel like it 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.520
 to give an answer to that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.900
 just tick off once and for all 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.540
 question number three the extremely common 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.490
 may come already noticed 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.230
 Jim Ross shops a lot of time 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.950
 just sold out t shirts and these 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.290
 stringer exactly my task last 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.120
 weeks was just the infrastructure for 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.490
 Just to improve the production 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.850
 and that's why now in the next 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.510
 Months step by step new 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.040
 I have very cool new products 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.660
 Producers are only a few hours by car 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.810
 from our logistics center in berlin 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.520
 that's what's meant to be removed 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.490
 For me, it was important for me 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.220
 Working conditions We have someone 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.930
 the simple environment protects the things 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.250
 logistics center can transport yes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.020
 by truck and not big by per 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.390
 ship or by plane or per 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.250
 something for me, of course 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.570
 entrepreneurs are important the short 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.250
 transport sides that means I have to 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.810
 not wait a month until somehow 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.120
 the things of wess year from where 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 come and the quality will too 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.690
 Simply, I was extremely'm happy 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.130
 very on it when the first 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.780
 products data that will run like that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.400
 First the sold out jumbo stuff 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.459
 that's what the stuff is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.640
 who have sold best afterwards 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.790
 will the slim stain come collection 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.430
 expanded 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.269
 it has been in the end just 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.980
 to test if this slim fit idea of 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.590
 us in the end pulls this thing that 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.910
 just a lot of people say okay I have 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 like to dress clothes a bit muscle 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.450
 emphasizes he is still a bit 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.100
 longer because easy in sports 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.090
 People take on the stature 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.450
 bit changed wider shoulders 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.650
 wider chest wide back etc 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.390
 And it has definitely been confirmed 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.769
 That's why the collection is easy 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.940
 that is being continuously expanded 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.989
 more colors in t-shirts give it 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.720
 will be completely different products 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.190
 give sweaters over any 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.070
 pants et cetera always with this focus 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.540
 worst that anyone on this page 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.920
 is loud markus link comes he is always 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.360
 the same cuts always find 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.440
 this limit cuts and can be too 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.730
 Be sure that this cut always 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.530
 I find that extremely important because 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.790
 I think it's super annoying in the city too 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.070
 go and no matching things 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.450
 t shirt too short not tight enough 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.459
 is stupid 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.920
 that was finally the motivation behind 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.180
 the brand and the third is still in the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.060
 give complete relaunch 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.440
 by jim ross that is 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.250
 in the end new logo new branding 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.610
 simply in the end a second one 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.390
 line I'm also extremely excited about it 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.200
 and yes that was the topic of products 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.400
 Now just hang a little bit of that 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.170
 Production as I said the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.130
 Transport times are extremely short of 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.209
 producers to the logistics center yes there 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.040
 In any case, I'm looking forward to that 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.380
 I can announce that to you next 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.810
 point because many people write where 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.549
 I live yes I live in Munich 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.139
 or Munich suburb of vor 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.190
 drawn almost ten years and then 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.630
 in between always a bit 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.169
 hiked as the first berlin a few 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.790
 years back then over jim ross 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.360
 actually then also görgl met 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.010
 and Kolja still met few others 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.960
 youtuber met because he was very 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.630
 funny and after last year in 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.940
 vancouver and now again 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.520
 Back in Munich after some travel in the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.450
 last year new Zealand etc and will 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.620
 it also the next years first 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.900
 Munich stay my girlfriend stays in 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.790
 Munich or he has fix her job for the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.050
 next year that is for me the 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.470
 motivation too first in Munich too 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.510
 stay 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.300
 Nevertheless, of course I can from the 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.070
 still doing well my travel 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.050
 that's also the next point of travel 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.940
 that is often addressed this year 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.500
 still some travel in front of me not so 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.700
 very extreme the last year but me 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.740
 think it will net in any case 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.030
 of course take you too 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.880
 the first planned trip is in 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.400
 september to jerusalem for ten days 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.380
 I am very happy after that I will 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.090
 in october my friend briefly what 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.919
 please do with her I think so 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.220
 a beach vacation or something and im 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.810
 november 's where it all goes 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.370
 maybe i'll hang another week rio 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.620
 before that and just have a look 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.100
 is so long flight maybe anyway 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.330
 that's an option 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.440
 otherwise maybe just a few 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.630
 unplanned travel now for example 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.160
 here south tyrol so what offers itself 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.510
 always i can work from anywhere 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.830
 that's why it 's always nice and that 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.740
 last I ask relatively often 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.790
 wars is the topic of car I am now 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.220

 necessarily videos with his dream gate around 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.350
 But this would have if you ask me 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.430
 then i am going to be big r8 there 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.470

 long time than not exactly 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.220
 when came out maybe that's about 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.390
 2007 or something like that already some 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.320
 I'll get that next year 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.340
 Face lift has me on now personally 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.810

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.990
 I am very big fan of this time 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.710

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.440
