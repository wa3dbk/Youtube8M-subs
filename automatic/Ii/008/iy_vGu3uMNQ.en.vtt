00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
and this consists of I guess three

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
and this consists of I guess three

if this is not going to do any harm so

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
i'll leave it burning for a little while

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.399 
i'll leave it burning for a little while
because<00:01:24.580> i'm<00:01:24.790> going<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.030> find<00:01:25.390> pick<00:01:26.140> up

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
because i'm going to find pick up

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.370 
because i'm going to find pick up
another<00:01:27.190> easter<00:01:27.640> egg<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.600> also<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.200> not

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
another easter egg this also is not

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.139 
another easter egg this also is not
particularly<00:01:29.950> noticeable<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.610> it's<00:01:36.119> well<00:01:37.119> i

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
particularly noticeable but it's well i

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.490 
particularly noticeable but it's well i
guess<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.509> little<00:01:37.720> bit<00:01:37.990> more<00:01:38.229> subtle<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:41.380> to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
guess a little bit more subtle I have to

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.190 
guess a little bit more subtle I have to
go<00:01:41.649> back<00:01:41.799> behind<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:44.549> outhouse<00:01:45.810> where<00:01:46.810> people

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
go back behind the outhouse where people

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.359 
go back behind the outhouse where people
probably<00:01:47.680> wouldn't<00:01:47.950> look<00:01:48.369> very<00:01:48.430> readily<00:01:49.030> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
probably wouldn't look very readily and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.889 
probably wouldn't look very readily and
as<00:01:51.369> we<00:01:51.700> look<00:01:52.570> there<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.979> sign<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
as we look there it is it's a sign and

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.190 
as we look there it is it's a sign and
let's<00:01:56.259> zoom<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:56.890> sign<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:58.710> we<00:02:01.200> see

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
let's zoom in on that sign and we see

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.880 
let's zoom in on that sign and we see
that<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.619> says<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:04.119> lived<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:04.590> you'd<00:02:05.590> be

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
that it says if you lived here you'd be

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.020 
that it says if you lived here you'd be
home<00:02:06.190> now<00:02:07.830> touch<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:09.009> humor<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.610> part<00:02:09.940> of

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
home now touch of humor on the part of

you see it's completely stiff now here I
know<00:02:59.350> I'm<00:02:59.620> going<00:02:59.829> to<00:02:59.890> feel<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.959> Martha

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
know I'm going to feel like Martha

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.960 
know I'm going to feel like Martha
Stewart<00:03:02.370> here<00:03:03.370> I'm<00:03:04.950> adjusting<00:03:05.950> its<00:03:06.310> location

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
Stewart here I'm adjusting its location

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.120 
Stewart here I'm adjusting its location
this<00:03:07.299> is<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.840> convenient<00:03:08.260> as<00:03:08.530> hanging<00:03:08.829> a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
this is not as convenient as hanging a

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.009 
this is not as convenient as hanging a
picture<00:03:09.760> but<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.209> last<00:03:10.390> part<00:03:10.660> will<00:03:10.989> be

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
picture but the last part will be

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.630 
picture but the last part will be
because<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.709> don't<00:03:11.980> have<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.280> worry<00:03:12.489> about

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
because I don't have to worry about

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.819 
because I don't have to worry about
where<00:03:13.269> I'm<00:03:13.390> going<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.840> nail<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.170> put<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
where I'm going to nail it put in the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.849 
where I'm going to nail it put in the
nail<00:03:15.040> in<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:16.030> wall<00:03:16.060> Oh<00:03:16.600> Martha<00:03:17.530> Stewart

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
wouldn't want me to put in a nail anyway

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.130 
wouldn't want me to put in a nail anyway
she<00:03:19.959> had<00:03:20.140> some<00:03:20.380> other<00:03:20.500> idea<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:22.540> what<00:03:23.019> i'm

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
she had some other idea now what i'm

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.930 
she had some other idea now what i'm
doing<00:03:23.410> here<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:23.950> adjusting<00:03:24.790> its

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
doing here is just adjusting its

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.630 
doing here is just adjusting its
location<00:03:25.629> and<00:03:25.840> its<00:03:25.959> rotation<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.610> that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
location and its rotation so that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.730 
location and its rotation so that
it<00:03:30.640> will<00:03:30.940> be<00:03:31.840> neatly<00:03:32.200> positioned<00:03:32.980> as<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
it will be neatly positioned as a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.600 
it will be neatly positioned as a
something<00:03:35.740> like<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.920> picture<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.820> wall<00:03:36.970> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
something like a picture on the wall and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.210 
something like a picture on the wall and
you'll<00:03:39.610> notice<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.540> not<00:03:41.170> solid<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:41.890> can

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
you'll notice it it's not solid so I can

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.250 
you'll notice it it's not solid so I can
make<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.670> pass<00:03:42.880> right<00:03:43.180> through<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.660> wall<00:03:43.840> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
make it pass right through the wall and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.220 
make it pass right through the wall and
I<00:03:44.890> use<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.430> little<00:03:45.760> bit<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.210> test<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:47.110> be

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
I use that a little bit the test to be

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.940 
I use that a little bit the test to be
sure<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.470> how<00:03:48.130> close<00:03:48.460> it<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.000> wall<00:03:49.950> that

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
sure I how close it is to the wall that

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.060 
sure I how close it is to the wall that
little<00:03:51.610> thing<00:03:52.270> there<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:52.780> obviously<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.800> can

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
little thing there with obviously I can

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.460 
little thing there with obviously I can
use<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.490> to<00:03:54.550> adjust<00:03:55.060> its<00:03:55.240> location<00:03:55.870> here

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
use that to adjust its location here

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.200 
use that to adjust its location here
watching<00:03:57.220> you'll<00:03:57.370> notice<00:03:57.700> part<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.180> that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
watching you'll notice part of it that

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.380 
watching you'll notice part of it that
disappears<00:03:58.930> being<00:03:59.260> into<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.710> wall<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.390> so

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
disappears being into the wall and so

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.750 
disappears being into the wall and so
when<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.690> sort<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.680> right<00:04:02.950> or

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
when I sort of have that right or

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.900 
when I sort of have that right or
unsatisfied<00:04:04.450> with<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.840> there<00:04:05.740> I've<00:04:06.070> hung<00:04:06.700> the

at<00:04:45.910> hobo<00:04:46.479> village<00:04:46.979> so<00:04:47.979> I<00:04:48.040> got<00:04:48.310> that<00:04:48.580> out

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
at hobo village so I got that out

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.510 
at hobo village so I got that out
there's<00:04:49.900> only<00:04:50.260> one<00:04:50.410> problem<00:04:50.710> with<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.160> it's

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
there's only one problem with that it's

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.600 
there's only one problem with that it's
so<00:04:51.669> not<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.450> right<00:04:52.660> shape<00:04:52.950> it's<00:04:53.950> too<00:04:54.340> short

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
so not the right shape it's too short

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.180 
so not the right shape it's too short
but<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.540> can<00:04:55.720> fix<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.700> can<00:04:57.700> edit<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:59.440> width

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
but I can fix that I can edit the width

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.500 
but I can fix that I can edit the width
and<00:05:00.490> stretch<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:02.050> make<00:05:02.680> it<00:05:03.330> somewhat<00:05:04.330> the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
and stretch it to make it somewhat the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.630 
and stretch it to make it somewhat the
right<00:05:04.690> shape<00:05:05.050> think<00:05:05.919> I'll<00:05:06.070> make<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.370> bigger

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
right shape think I'll make it bigger

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.500 
right shape think I'll make it bigger
too<00:05:07.000> while<00:05:07.270> I'm<00:05:07.479> at<00:05:07.510> it<00:05:08.160> see<00:05:09.160> I<00:05:09.190> just<00:05:09.669> that<00:05:10.150> this

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
too while I'm at it see I just that this

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.650 
too while I'm at it see I just that this
works<00:05:10.810> just<00:05:11.020> exactly<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.680> way<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:12.010> does<00:05:12.490> in

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
works just exactly the way it does in

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.590 
works just exactly the way it does in
