00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 hello nice that you look again 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.759
 today we are making another delicious 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 dish and that is the cooking belt this time 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.000
 fish 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.949
 This realization is from Marije de Vries 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 fitter the netherlands but he has a whole 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.609
 nice book written that is the fitness 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.320
 Bible for women was really one 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.910
 recommended if you want to move more 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.539
 but really do n't know how to do that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.460
 to tackle 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.720
 for this dish need a can 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 leaked out 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.589
 lentils some cooking school 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.110
 arugula chestnut mushrooms 2 shallots 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.199
 and a clove of garlic 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 cod fillet a little cream butter 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.190
 to bake 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.680
 pepper and spices have only to him 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 start preparing the vegetables 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.850
 I'm going for the chestnut mushrooms 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 just cut into slices I think 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.540
 chestnut mushrooms always nice to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.479
 have slightly stronger taste than the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.479
 white mushrooms a bit nutty 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.060
 so she does not have to be very nice 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.990
 may we stay a little coarse in it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.990
 another shallot 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020
 and 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.670
 Would some butter in the pan can 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.420
 with the shallots 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.420
 press the clove of garlic 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 I just leave the arrow in the garlic 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.369
 Keep going you will notice this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 dish actually no processed at all 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.179
 products 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280
 and he can give you a good tip because 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.020
 if you go to the supermarket you must 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 but pay attention in the outer ring of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.530
 the supermarket are actually all fresh 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.240
 products and in the inner ring of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 supermarket products are all listed 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.960
 products that have a long shelf life but 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 which often also has many preservatives 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.009
 so if you have the outside more often 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.390
 went from the supermarket you know 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.759
 actually automatically 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 whatever fresh there is also the lentil 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.500
 The moment briefly cooked 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.960
 would I now bake cod 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.200
 he picks him up some butter in the pair 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.520
 minutes cooked in this cod comes out 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.320
 the freezer and that is also a good one 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.530
 option if you can't get fresh cod 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.530
 find 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.260
 so under the coke can add and I do the 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.180
 adjust at the last so that they are too beautiful 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.870
 green color is retained 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.870
 nice and fresh 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.650
 so how can it then the cod 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.120
 then so 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.190
 and the cooking fluid of the cod 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.299
 I use to make my tasty cream sauce 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.930
 to make 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.150
 add some coconut milk 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.769
 and many people think of coconut milk it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.209
 contains saturated fats 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.970
 that is actually not the case at all 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.500
 good for you but he become the media 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.120
 adjusted a bit about that and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 saturated fat is not always at all 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.329
 bad for you need for example 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.549
 certain hormones make your body 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.430
 I'd leave this for a bit 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.290
 the sauce would be ready to cook 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.290
 I am the last to pour over the fish 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.099
 this dish is again delicious 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.099
 would easily make x in verse
