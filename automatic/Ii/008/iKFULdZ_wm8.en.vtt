are<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.200> similar<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:50.520> kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> cool<00:00:51.649> which

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
are very similar just kind of cool which

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.090 
are very similar just kind of cool which
may<00:00:52.800> i<00:00:53.039> recommend<00:00:53.190> would<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.149> better<00:00:54.649> i<00:00:55.649> can't

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
may i recommend would be better i can't

this<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.710> better<00:01:28.770> cos<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.880> that's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
actually more comfortable to me it's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.280 
actually more comfortable to me it's
more<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.220> natural<00:01:35.240> working<00:01:36.240> grip<00:01:36.420> once

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
more like a natural working grip once

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
more like a natural working grip once
this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.979> natural<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.579> fighting<00:01:38.970> grab

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this is more natural in a fighting grab

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.530 
this is more natural in a fighting grab
because<00:01:39.680> over<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:41.700> hands<00:01:41.909> feel<00:01:42.030> woman

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
because over here my hands feel woman

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.700 
because over here my hands feel woman
it's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.770> weird<00:01:44.720> um<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.780> guess<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.590> get

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's a little weird um I guess they get

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.960 
it's a little weird um I guess they get
squished<00:01:47.040> too<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.340> whereas<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
squished too much whereas this one is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.520 
squished too much whereas this one is
much<00:01:48.119> better<00:01:48.390> than<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.290> for

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
much better than but this is more for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.899 
much better than but this is more for
fighting<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:51.119> you'll<00:01:51.299> see<00:01:51.360> cuz<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.259> know

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
fighting as you'll see cuz you know

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
fighting as you'll see cuz you know
stabbing<00:01:53.909> um<00:01:56.719> goon<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.500> little

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
stabbing um goon this is just a little

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
stabbing um goon this is just a little
quick<00:01:58.829> quick<00:01:59.490> look<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.090> guess<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
quick quick look at I guess for the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.170 
quick quick look at I guess for the
comparison<00:02:01.200> these<00:02:01.320> two<00:02:01.469> because<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.710> just

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.730 

which<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.570> very<00:02:06.750> similar<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.350> terms<00:02:07.590> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
which is very very similar in terms of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.870 
which is very very similar in terms of
blade<00:02:07.920> profile<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.729> handle<00:02:09.090> shape

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
blade profile but not handle shape

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.000 
blade profile but not handle shape
