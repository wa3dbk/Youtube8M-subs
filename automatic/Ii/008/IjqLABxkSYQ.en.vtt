00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
camera on the Samsung be far far clearer

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
camera on the Samsung be far far clearer
far<00:01:21.000> better<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.259> felt<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.740> nexus

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
far better so one thing I felt the nexus

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
far better so one thing I felt the nexus

the<00:01:27.240> nexus<00:01:27.540> 4<00:01:27.810> seems<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> work<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.560> little<00:01:28.590> bit

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the nexus 4 seems to work a little bit

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.060 
the nexus 4 seems to work a little bit
but<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.400> quite<00:01:30.329> hard<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> catch<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.170> s4<00:01:31.770> one

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but and quite hard to catch the s4 one

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
but and quite hard to catch the s4 one
under<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> libe<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.210> hit<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> line

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
under the libe what it does hit the line

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.080 
under the libe what it does hit the line
it<00:01:33.930> doesn't<00:01:34.049> look<00:01:34.229> pretty<00:01:34.439> cool<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.610> when

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it doesn't look pretty cool so when

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
it doesn't look pretty cool so when
those<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> physical

with the nexus for sound quality wise

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.480 
with the nexus for sound quality wise
again<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.990> Samsung<00:02:46.770> has<00:02:46.890> got<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> edge<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
again the Samsung has got the edge on it

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.100 
again the Samsung has got the edge on it
but<00:02:47.760> again<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.390> phone<00:02:48.630> that's<00:02:48.840> double<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
but again for a phone that's double the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.660 
but again for a phone that's double the
price<00:02:49.320> that's<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.800> kind<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.370> thing<00:02:50.520> you'd

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
price that's the kind of thing you'd

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.250 
price that's the kind of thing you'd
expect<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.720> I'll<00:02:51.840> leave<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.140> at<00:02:52.200> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
expect so I'll leave it at that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.160 
expect so I'll leave it at that
obviously<00:02:52.710> on<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.540> Samsung<00:02:54.930> we've<00:02:55.050> got

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
obviously on the the Samsung we've got

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.900 
obviously on the the Samsung we've got
TouchWiz<00:02:55.620> interface<00:02:55.650> over<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.460> top<00:02:56.700> which

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
TouchWiz interface over the top which

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.180

some<00:02:57.570> people<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:58.050> some<00:02:58.320> people<00:02:58.590> dislike<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
some people like some people dislike I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.270 
some people like some people dislike I
think<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> basic<00:03:00.270> user<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.900> be<00:03:01.050> better

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
think as a basic user it can be better

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.980 
think as a basic user it can be better
but<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:02.760> really<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.420> clean<00:03:03.720> on

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
but I do really really like the clean on

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.380 
but I do really really like the clean on
messed<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:04.500> look<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.580> Nexus<00:03:05.940> 4<00:03:06.210> and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
messed with look of the the Nexus 4 and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.420 
messed with look of the the Nexus 4 and
how<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.570> know<00:03:06.900> functions<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.590> applications

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
how you know functions with applications

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.080 
how you know functions with applications
so<00:03:09.210> what<00:03:09.900> I'll<00:03:10.020> do<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.410> I'll<00:03:10.710> pop<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.580> few<00:03:11.850> links

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
so what I'll do is I'll pop a few links

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.340 
so what I'll do is I'll pop a few links
if<00:03:12.270> you're<00:03:12.360> interested<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.870> any<00:03:13.020> more<00:03:13.080> and
