00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hi everyone, today I would like to make you a video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.089
 all 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.710
 but it is a bit peculiar in the third 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.630
 churches have been to the pharmacy 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.880
 I decided to let you see what they are 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.299
 the products I bought so is one 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 drugstore shopping 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.900
 some of the products that I will show you in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.359
 actually we see sent and two chosen on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.519
 site that has a pharmacy and also 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.439
 the site and others are purchases I have 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.010
 I simply did everything 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.109
 together 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.420
 all the same, shy, all right 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.579
 in the info box and immediately start to make you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 see all the pigtails a lawn too 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 the first thing I bought back in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 actually therefore it is not a first time e 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.120
 half the second time I buy it is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.940
 this tito product which is the 3 believes 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 he is practically a treatment for 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.239
 hair that should be used simply 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 as you use the cream ficio 9 that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.539
 that I really like 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.059
 I had taken this treatment here 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.789
 long ago then I actually brought it to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 Milan when I went down to do something else 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.120
 I left it in the house of Milan e 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.939
 so it's been a long time since I've had it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 more therefore I had to buy it back 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.380
 the other is not finished for the non-one 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 you have seen it in finished products 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.939
 but in fact I did n't have it here it is in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 reality is a product that you like 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 very much because I like how I treat myself 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 and how it arranges your hair then seen 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 that are improving a lot 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.009
 I want to keep getting caught 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.080
 today it is possible then I bought this 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
 lip balm of the view that is the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 daily conditioner this here is a 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.729
 wonderful balm award has finished a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 couple of times if I'm not mistaken or maybe three 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.400
 in any case, it is an excellent balm 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.799
 it is very dense to spread but it goes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.630
 great especially when you go to 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.540
 scrub and then you need to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.159
 retract and blame my lips well 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.619
 I use it as a trick and a walde 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.869
 use mainly in the morning for 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.000
 this vanilla scent that I like 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.909
 very much and it seems to me just the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.159
 This morning's cuddle is here 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.930
 fantastic is true among council not me 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.670
 I remember the price because I know that between 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.280
 the other if they are 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.020
 different types but I love this here in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.720
 I will give you everything in particular 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.580
 in the info box price including why 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.920
 I do not remember, however, in 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.020
 I am going to refer to another video editing 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 which I bought at the pharmacy and which 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.870
 however, I almost always buy them this 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.080
 deodorant cream body of the bike 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.360
 this is gorgeous here it is alcohol free and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.730
 therefore without parabens 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.220
 veloster I recommend to me the hard effect 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.100
 very much and even now anyway that is 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.530
 was and therefore I definitely need 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.930
 of a deodorant that is the most tenacious 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.540
 possible I must say that with this I go 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 always on the safe side I apply it in the morning 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.060
 and in the evening nothing happened 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.510
 strange without going too far into 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.680
 so absolutely details 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.230
 highly recommended it costs a little bit though 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.810
 indeed very little indeed is required to 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.220
 me lasts 3 4 months also applying it to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.080
 sometimes twice a day 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.670
 you saw that in the video where we have 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.220
 shown what I do for 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.260
 the tan you shouted to me a lot 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.000
 because I do n't use the after-sun 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.769
 I decided to buy back my after-sun 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.530
 absolute favorite than this 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.650
 so having thermal water is a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.079
 moisturizing and soothing and for skins 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.000
 sensitive so this is fine 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.070
 also for those like me who have dermatitis 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.989
 so with this product I am 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.690
 always found very well and has it 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.739
 bought back the price is a bit high though 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.780
 let's say that in summer 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.209
 however I often have to use 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.180
 dofus all and therefore good or bad I can 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.980
 always finish it without letting it expire without it 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.989
 that the product I go has also wasted 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.780
 because in reality there is so much there 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.019
 are 400 ml of product but really 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.420
 in the summer they use so much instead on the 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.000
 jiao pharmacy site loose 4 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.940
 little products that attracted me so much 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.069
 one is the vichy concealer the dermis 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.470
 blend, however, wanted to take it in color 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.630
 35 which is the color curtains 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.630
 because what I have that I think is 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.820
 25 is too clear for now 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.370
 and even on small imperfections not 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.050
 should therefore be absolutely seen 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.959
 that I am fine with this 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.890
 corrector I wanted to try the shade 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.200
 a little darker 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.420
 I think it is a darker tone 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.220
 mine and should be fine because I have 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.350
 tried to bloom on the hand and me 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.210
 it seems that the color is perfect now 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.210
 I will also try it on the dark circles of the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.060
 roush pose I took this land 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.480
 will be worth blush is a sad practically 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.220
 composed of this earth that it is 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.010
 slightly shimmer the dwarf has very little 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.020
 this one is much more glittery than it is 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.720
 much more by evening and then if this blush 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.310
 in a very very natural color 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 I like these products because 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.330
 even just mixing all three there 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.820
 together they immediately go to illuminate the 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.030
 face and still giving its own light 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.890
 to the complexion without going to take the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.930
 skin uses them a little 11 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.990
 I love the things I answered 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.580
 lots of them as far as they are concerned 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.770
 it concerns the skin that is therefore 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.720
 I absolutely don't think it will 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.580
 disappointed but then I'll let you know 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.060
 however this is specifically the 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.070
 turn around the food red she and you 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.229
 he practically calls bronzin powder 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.360
 I can't find the number but I think 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.250
 that actually fingers an even in one 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.229
 clearer version are for ours 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.870
 lines i think this is a posture 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.650
 however I still have to try it then vi 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.050
 I'll let you know 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.600
 I took this stick again for the 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.360
 lip protection which is the capital 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.669
 soleil of vichy I must say that I 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.520
 I always forget my lips in the sense that 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.660
 I have a lot of cocoa butter but often not 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.380
 they have a protection factor 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.580
 quite high and instead the lips are 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.290
 very important to protect by chance 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.110
 not subject to many wrinkles 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.580
 especially in the contour area 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.220
 I wanted to take this here that a 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.590
 protection factor 30 and not those 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.110
 higher because already mind because this 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.840
 here however it does not remain white on 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.920
 lips which is something I hate 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.630
 see these 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.660
 lip balm type those that you 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.880
 they put in the mountains in winter by the sea 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.520
 you do n't personally like an effect 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.950
 I think it's bad to see this 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.410
 white swipe on the lips and the thing 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.870
 positive of this here also protects 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.780
 precisely but does not do this effect therefore 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.730
 absolutely wanted to take it is 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.220
 the last thing I chose was 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.930
 this face cream that made me 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.270
 it really drove me crazy 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.610
 a lot from the site is an evolution 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.390
 smoothing first wrinkles and it's called 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:43.540
 nlvana sqlite this here is the peony e 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.480
 blue lotus seeds and is an anti wrinkle but is 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.660
 also a cream that is used to almost can 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.790
 facilitate dilated pores or in any case a 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.740
 minimize skin texture therefore 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.650
 since I am always very well 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.110
 with nuxe products or oil for i 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.660
 then hair or eye contour cream 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.330
 I have several products of this brand and I 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.640
 i like them all now i'm very curious 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.400
 to find this cream is absolutely 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.830
 then see a review or otherwise ve 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.110
 I'll talk about it in some other video by 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.240
 this was all my shopping today 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.860
 obviously in the pharmacy 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.390
 some of these products I believe 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.660
 can also be found in drugstore 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.740
 but here it is a problem for me to find 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.070
 the parapharmacies 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.350
 so let's say that I usually go 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.720
 in the pharmacy but I think the point is yes 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.600
 they can easily find even the moles 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.370
 stores that still sell parapharmacy 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.140
 I hope I have given you some ideas 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.420
 interesting, in short , it seemed like one 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.270
 type of video a little different from 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.500
 however one is usually one however 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.450
 different from the usual 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.280
 in any case, I also hope to have you 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.430
 I keep a big company with you 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.550
 step and we'll see you at the next video 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.550
 Hello
