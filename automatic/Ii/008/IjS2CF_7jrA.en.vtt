something really magical about it that I

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.290 
something really magical about it that I
could<00:00:18.420> feel<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.859> began<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.730> study<00:00:23.789> it

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
could feel and so I I began to study it

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.220 
could feel and so I I began to study it
and<00:00:24.920> then<00:00:26.090> over<00:00:27.090> over<00:00:27.630> years<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:30.230> discovered

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and then over over years I I discovered

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.370 
and then over over years I I discovered
when<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> studied<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> especially<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.350> I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
when when I studied it especially when I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.299 
when when I studied it especially when I
was<00:00:34.590> studying<00:00:34.800> dance<00:00:35.899> that<00:00:37.070> something<00:00:38.070> was

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
was studying dance that something was

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.380 
was studying dance that something was
changing<00:00:38.910> inside<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.840> me<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.390> found

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
changing inside of me and so I found

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.090 
changing inside of me and so I found
that<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.070> even<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.280> fascinating<00:00:47.640> than

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
that to be even more fascinating than

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
that to be even more fascinating than
fear<00:00:50.100> itself<00:00:50.700> watching<00:00:51.390> theater<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
fear itself watching theater or the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
fear itself watching theater or the
external<00:00:53.370> aspect<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.270> thought<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.320> was

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
external aspect of it I thought what was

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.729 
external aspect of it I thought what was
going<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.829> inside<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:57.079> although<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.500> more

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
going on inside was although it was more

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.970 
going on inside was although it was more
subtle<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.680> powerful<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.829> really

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
subtle it was very powerful and really

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
subtle it was very powerful and really
interesting<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.780> changing<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
interesting because I was changing it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.160 
interesting because I was changing it
was<00:01:04.500> changing<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:10.380> aspect<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
was changing me and so that aspect of it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
was changing me and so that aspect of it
the<00:01:13.170> study<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.580> practice<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:17.240> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the study of it the practice of it is to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.260 
the study of it the practice of it is to
me<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.990> fascinating<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.729> reason<00:01:20.939> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
me really fascinating so the reason I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.160 
me really fascinating so the reason I
call<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:24.020> practice<00:01:25.020> budo<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
call this practice budo is because it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.210 
call this practice budo is because it
means<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.920> way<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.400> dance<00:01:31.159> just<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.729> the

when I saw them in the Olympics I

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.270 
when I saw them in the Olympics I
thought<00:02:09.899> they<00:02:10.080> were<00:02:10.140> completely<00:02:10.740> of<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
thought they were completely of a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.670 
thought they were completely of a
different<00:02:11.790> nature<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:13.050> different<00:02:13.470> realm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
different nature in a different realm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.400 
different nature in a different realm
than<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.209> other<00:02:15.390> teams<00:02:16.170> from<00:02:16.320> different

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
than all the other teams from different

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.830 
than all the other teams from different
countries<00:02:16.920> there<00:02:17.880> was<00:02:18.000> something<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.450> on

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
countries there was something going on

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.960 
countries there was something going on
in<00:02:19.200> them<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.740> individuals<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:22.970> subtle

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
in them as individuals that was subtle

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
in them as individuals that was subtle
and<00:02:24.240> powerful<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.470> were<00:02:25.530> practicing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and powerful they were practicing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.140 
and powerful they were practicing
something<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.880> could<00:02:27.090> see<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.640> really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
something I could see and I I really

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.840 
something I could see and I I really
admired<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> um<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.450> thought<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
admired that and so um I thought as a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.199 
admired that and so um I thought as a
teacher<00:02:35.850> teaching<00:02:36.540> dance<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:38.160> always<00:02:39.000> knew

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
teacher teaching dance I always knew

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.570 
teacher teaching dance I always knew
that<00:02:39.240> there's<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.050> way<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:41.100> there's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
that there's a way to it there's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.090 
that there's a way to it there's
something<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.480> underneath<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.410> that's

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
something going on underneath it that's

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.400 
something going on underneath it that's
really<00:02:45.000> powerful<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.480> when<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> practice

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
really powerful so so so when I practice

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.960 
really powerful so so so when I practice
and<00:02:49.620> wanted<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.890> open<00:02:50.100> my<00:02:50.880> own<00:02:51.320> studio<00:02:52.320> um<00:02:52.970> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and wanted to open my own studio um I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.000 
and wanted to open my own studio um I
