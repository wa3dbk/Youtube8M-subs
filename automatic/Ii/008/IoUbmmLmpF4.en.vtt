looks

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
looks

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
looks
but<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.989> lightly<00:00:52.260> buffing<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> color

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but I'm just lightly buffing that color

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520 
but I'm just lightly buffing that color
into<00:00:53.399> my<00:00:53.550> crease<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> top<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
into my crease and just at the top of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
into my crease and just at the top of
the<00:00:55.590> bridge<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.010> nose<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the bridge of my nose you don't have to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.500 
the bridge of my nose you don't have to
have<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> bright<00:00:59.520> colors<00:00:59.550> or<00:01:00.239> dark

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have like a lot of bright colors or dark

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
have like a lot of bright colors or dark
colors<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> create<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.739> beautiful<00:01:02.160> shapes

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
colors to create really beautiful shapes

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
colors to create really beautiful shapes
so<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> way<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> keep<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> natural<00:01:04.199> but

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
so this is a way to keep it natural but

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
so this is a way to keep it natural but
give<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.189> dimension<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:06.030> eyes<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
give a lot of dimension to your eyes so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.719 
give a lot of dimension to your eyes so
just<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:07.110> into<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> crease<00:01:07.740> keeping<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just going into the crease keeping it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
just going into the crease keeping it
more<00:01:08.850> concentrated<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> outer<00:01:10.229> half<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
more concentrated on the outer half of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
more concentrated on the outer half of
your<00:01:11.430> eye<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.700> pulling<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> then

just<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> open<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:25.340> find

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
just to open them up a little bit I find

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
just to open them up a little bit I find
that<00:01:26.520> sometimes<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.570> plain<00:01:27.960> white

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
that sometimes just like plain white

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
that sometimes just like plain white
army<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.790> grey

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.929 
army can go like kind of like a grey
color<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.110> mixing<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:31.939> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
color so I'll be mixing that into the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.130 
color so I'll be mixing that into the
darker<00:01:33.930> paint<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.380> I'll<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.560> using<00:01:34.590> later

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
darker paint that I'll be using later

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.580 
darker paint that I'll be using later
but<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> middle<00:01:37.950> pink<00:01:38.250> color<00:01:39.470> it's<00:01:40.470> got

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
crease so I'm not pushing it into the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.580 
crease so I'm not pushing it into the
crease<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.659> bringing<00:01:58.049> out<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.350> shape

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
crease but just bringing out the shape

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.280 
crease but just bringing out the shape
of<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:58.950> actual<00:01:59.369> eyelid<00:02:00.950> with<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.820> bottom<00:02:03.299> kind

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
of my actual eyelid with the bottom kind

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.649 
of my actual eyelid with the bottom kind
of<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.100> pinky<00:02:05.820> color

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
of around the pinky color

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
of around the pinky color
I'm<00:02:07.079> going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.649> sweep<00:02:07.859> that<00:02:08.099> along<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.399> lower

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
I'm going to sweep that along my lower

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119 
I'm going to sweep that along my lower
lash<00:02:09.030> line<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:10.289> carry<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> towards<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
lash line and carry it towards the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.040 
lash line and carry it towards the
center<00:02:11.280> slightly<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.390> meets<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.840> that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
center slightly so it meets with that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.740 
center slightly so it meets with that
white<00:02:13.290> color<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.730> totally<00:02:15.180> covering<00:02:15.599> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
white color but not totally covering it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.119 
white color but not totally covering it
and<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.140> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> make<00:02:16.470> my<00:02:16.709> bottom

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
and this is going to make my bottom

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.520 
and this is going to make my bottom
lashes<00:02:17.340> look<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:18.150> little<00:02:18.569> bit<00:02:18.810> thicker<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:21.530> like

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
lashes look a little bit thicker I like

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.949 
lashes look a little bit thicker I like
it<00:02:22.739> because<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.519> got<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.910> rosy<00:02:24.360> color<00:02:24.569> but

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it because it's got that rosy color but

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.699 
it because it's got that rosy color but
it's<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:26.299> matte<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.989> adds<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.379> little<00:02:28.500> bit

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
it's not matte so it adds a little bit

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.520 
it's not matte so it adds a little bit
of<00:02:28.799> light<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> mr.<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:30.959> now<00:02:31.170> I
