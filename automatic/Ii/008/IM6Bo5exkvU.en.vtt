a<00:00:31.710> mission<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.160> made<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> hacking<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> little

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
a mission they made the hacking a little

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
a mission they made the hacking a little
bit<00:00:33.750> more<00:00:33.930> complex<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.130> added<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
bit more complex and they added this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.920 
bit more complex and they added this
little<00:00:35.700> minigame<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.480> you've<00:00:36.630> played

hacking is in this game I wanted to do a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.250 
hacking is in this game I wanted to do a
little<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:44.910> more<00:00:45.180> than<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.899> wanted<00:00:46.200> to

talk about the campaign and watchdogs is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
talk about the campaign and watchdogs is
very<00:01:05.250> short<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.360> also<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
very short but it's also not that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
very short but it's also not that
interesting<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> glad<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
interesting so I'm kind of glad that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
interesting so I'm kind of glad that
it's<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.240> short<00:01:09.510> other<00:01:09.689> missions<00:01:10.049> are

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's very short other missions are

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's very short other missions are
really<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.340> repetitive<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
really really repetitive you go to this

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.670 
really really repetitive you go to this
location<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.430> red<00:01:15.110> danger<00:01:16.110> zone<00:01:16.439> which

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
location it's in a red danger zone which

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310 
location it's in a red danger zone which
means<00:01:16.920> there's<00:01:17.280> enemies<00:01:17.720> that<00:01:18.720> inhabit<00:01:19.200> this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
means there's enemies that inhabit this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.460 
means there's enemies that inhabit this
danger<00:01:19.740> zone<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.900> you're<00:01:21.900> supposed<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> take

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
danger zone and you're supposed to take

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
danger zone and you're supposed to take
them<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:23.820> hacking<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
them out and then do some hacking and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.760 
them out and then do some hacking and
then<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> end<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> mission

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
then that's the end of the mission

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.300 
then that's the end of the mission
trigger<00:01:26.729> cutscene<00:01:27.150> continue<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.229> same<00:01:29.100> old

thing every single time you do the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.289

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
missions and I don't like that I want

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
missions and I don't like that I want
some<00:01:34.460> diversity<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> once<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.060> clear<00:01:37.009> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
some diversity and once you clear the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
some diversity and once you clear the
danger<00:01:38.400> zone<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:39.390> free<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> roam<00:01:39.840> around

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
danger zone you're free to roam around

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.950 
danger zone you're free to roam around
no<00:01:40.530> sense<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.100> urgency<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.390> anything<00:01:42.570> like

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
no sense of urgency or anything like

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920 
no sense of urgency or anything like
that<00:01:43.640> really<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:45.450> talk<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that really now let's talk about the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.950 
that really now let's talk about the
l-train<00:01:46.200> shall<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.000> watchdogs<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
l-train shall we it's in watchdogs and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.510 
l-train shall we it's in watchdogs and
the<00:01:49.380> l-train<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.799> arguably<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.460> most

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the l-train is arguably one of the most

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.740 
the l-train is arguably one of the most
iconic<00:01:50.790> things<00:01:52.430> about<00:01:53.430> Chicago<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.509> did

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
iconic things about Chicago what did

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
iconic things about Chicago what did
they<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.950> copy<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.369> pasted<00:01:56.880> every

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
they do they copy and pasted every

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.990 
they do they copy and pasted every
single<00:01:58.009> station<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> L<00:01:59.729> train

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.229 
why even include a little countryside
with<00:03:40.290> pine<00:03:40.560> trees<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:40.950> mountains<00:03:41.640> when<00:03:42.120> you

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
with pine trees and mountains when you

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.630 
with pine trees and mountains when you
can't<00:03:42.480> do<00:03:42.660> anything<00:03:43.140> out<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.430> then

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
can't do anything out here but then

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.979 
can't do anything out here but then
again<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.000> can't<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.329> anything<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> city

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
again you can't do anything in the city

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.310 
again you can't do anything in the city
either<00:03:46.549> since<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.670> boring<00:03:48.320> monotonous

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
either since the boring monotonous

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.890 
either since the boring monotonous
little<00:03:50.040> playground<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.030> guess<00:03:51.510> since<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
little playground I guess since the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.150 
little playground I guess since the
developers<00:03:52.260> were<00:03:52.380> bored<00:03:52.709> with<00:03:52.920> their<00:03:53.070> own

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
developers were bored with their own

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.800 
developers were bored with their own
game<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.670> maybe<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> reason<00:03:54.780> for

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
game and maybe this is the reason for

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.840 
game and maybe this is the reason for
the<00:03:55.049> delay<00:03:55.350> they<00:03:55.799> had<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> digital<00:03:56.459> trips

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
the delay they had a digital trips

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.560 
the delay they had a digital trips
they've<00:03:57.570> got<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:57.930> called<00:03:58.200> madness<00:03:58.470> alone

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
they've got one called madness alone

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.990 
they've got one called madness alone
psychedelic<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.070> spider<00:04:02.070> tank<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.730> these

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
psychedelic and spider tank and these

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.849 
psychedelic and spider tank and these
are<00:04:03.470> very<00:04:04.470> very<00:04:05.459> boring<00:04:06.299> I'm<00:04:07.290> just<00:04:07.650> being
