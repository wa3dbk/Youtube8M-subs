00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.420

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.770
 severe injuries in the

 abandoned it must be his goal in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 to come to the national team 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.300
 the first goal is to be part of it 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.680
 he must try to the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.500
 services before the injury 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.779
 Trapp told the kicker 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.060
 24 years old fell last because of one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:35.540
 Joint injury about three months

 from kaka before contract extension

 borussia monchengladbach and the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.969
 Swiss national players want the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.219
 contract probably this week until 2019 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.860
 plus an option renew 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.829
 the kicker kakas reports 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.070
 original contract runs until summer 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.550
 2016 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.000
 the 22 year old plays since 2012 for the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000
 foal 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 klose obviously has a clause world champion 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.549
 miroslav klose can be at lazio rom 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 hopes for a new contract 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.080
 make the seasonal expiring 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 namely contract lengthens after 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 his twentieth season use 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.439
 automatically until 2016 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 This is reported by an Italian 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.960
 daily newspaper in the current game time 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.180
 The 36 year old has been running 17 times so far 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.479
 lazio, scoring five 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.479
 hit 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.640
 Blatter criticizes Uefa the current 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.350
 fifa boss has to fight for the election 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.420
 presidency the European 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.090
 football union was targeted 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.100
 you want to get rid of it all 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.570
 Unfortunately, opposition comes from the uefa 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.880
 I do not have the courage myself 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 but he has his 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.810
 mission has not been fulfilled and wanted 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.030
 another four years have to prove 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.190
 that football is far more than a game 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.880
 is said leaves at cnn 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:05.570
 the 78 year old has been president since 1998 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.399
 the fifa why has this team on 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 once what they actually did for years 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.910
 did not have a self-confidence 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.739
 how is it for you as you see today ? 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.530
 it also from the back of long special 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.390
 I think so before that for me 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.810
 The coach about it because it 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.819
 actually quite calm on the bench 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.860
 let him not spend so impulsively 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.990
 a lot of hectic in the matter purely even if 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.140
 it does not work that way 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.420
 clear in the head and that transfers 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.569
 I think you could do that completely 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.280
 easy on the individual persons too 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.280
 for example, you understand them 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.590
 martin strobel for years as 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.140
 talent 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.880
 do not unlearn 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.940
 got to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.700
 played was very good and at once can 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.640
 a team for me really well 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.350
 plays for me that is currently the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.700
 player of 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.710
 most importantly even for us that was 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.440
 super steering meets almost everyone 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.790
 time for fun, not anymore 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.670
 knows where to play just once 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.230
 throw down lower Rhine and so I believe 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.880
 we are simply closer as a team 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.590
 together so there is how know it has 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.030
 there is no superstar is one 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.070
 Pure looks, of course , that looked good 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.660
 me this Christian derailment you 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.220
 He did the derailment when it comes 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.560
 is the contact to the opponent 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.140
 record where it comes from 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.280
 is more necessary that you then another one to 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.540
 race or something is a mourning game 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 that ultimately has to do with the deadly game 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.180
 What should I say to violence there was 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.780
 Sometimes it was already a relatively long time ago 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.180
 in the game 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.090
 I think it was my third game one 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.350
 second game against flensburg 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.660
 lars christiansen got me from the beginning 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.440
 until the end really had in my bag and me 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.520
 I did not have a chance to wear a head scooter 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.299
 what do I know what was all I was 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.400
 really was about to explode 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.370
 but after that, that's also forgotten 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.050
 there is a hand and then you are one 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.130
 also got in contact what is for 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.570
 you important defense 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.430
 So you have to suffer from that too 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.850
 explain where do you say you have one 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.580
 good defense on what to leave when 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.440
 defense is very aggressive and the opponent 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.310
 puts pressure and she is fast 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.050
 have to complete 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.940
 that has a great I think he likes 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 as if one can see what the 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.960
 Goalkeeper out his death 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.900

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.310
