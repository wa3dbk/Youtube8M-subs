00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.160
 hi hello girls welcome how are you 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.219
 Today I bring you some nails 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.170
 barbie simple bikes good many 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.810
 girls asked me for a few years of barmen 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.640
 but I wanted to do something simpler here 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.280
 down in the information box I'm going to 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.950
 leave the link of the stickers if it is that 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.250
 you are interested because they are very cheap 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.900
 and very easy to apply good I hope that 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.900
 you like it so we started 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.110
 Well I put fake nails but what 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.270
 I made square and small ok I'm going to 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.820
 use a pink enamel can be 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.250
 whatever you see there and we're going to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.809
 paint the nails good in the last 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.809
 I wanted to have a white nail like that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.520
 I let it off and good I left it in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.770
 White 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.770
 and so let's do all the nails 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.050
 what then I buy these stickers in 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 ebay and well I here below I will leave 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.510
 the link we are going to cut out the one that you 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.810
 you want to use depends also the nail 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.020
 because you are think they are very small 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 and well I use the smallest one for 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 I can use it on that nail 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.630
 at the time I did not know how to apply it 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.940
 I was like moistening the paper I had 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.940
 and there it was letting go or a 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.130
 plastic so almost transparent super 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.770
 finite and then I applied it girls 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.320
 that in that part was not seen because in 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.240
 reality and I was breaking the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.830
 head to get the sticker not 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.450
 I knew how and I thought it was like a 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.150
 tattoo and in short 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.210
 it only moistens to remove it and 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.150
 then nothing else what I put it like that with the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.420
 I would act wet I put it on 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.420
 The nail 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.730
 then I put on transparent glaze but 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 I'm very careful because the enamel 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.290
 it can melt 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.840
 and then I'm going to put acrylic 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.170
 as I told you in a video on one occasion 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.080
 I do not know how to use acrylic but I like it 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.880
 experience i like to be able to try 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.640
 different things although maybe I'm not 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.740
 expert but I like to be able 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.740
 do everything 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.800
 I am using acrylic 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.800
 transparent 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.290
 and this is how we are going to pass this way 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.290
 to the entire nail 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.340
 to 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.450
 ah 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.720
 ah 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.010
 ok girls like this in this way we're going to 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.010
 do in all the nails 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.840
 ah 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.930
 ah 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.269
 then we will file the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.090
 ok well I had to take my time 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.280
 because as I nutrition or use 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.890
 the acrylic 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.640
 in some I was made some mountains 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.579
 all Swedish but but good senders and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.170
 with the lime this file is very strong in 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.950
 reality is very strong I understand it 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.200
 quijote where nails selection and good 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.480
 I had to be very careful like that 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.480
 that nothing we will file all the nails 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.030
 try to make them smooth and not 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.750
 there is not a bump neither 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:25.040
 well then I wanted to put a detail 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.100
 with acrylic I put a bow on him this is a 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.620
 tie that good I bought on ebay also 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.450
 are some accessories that I will then 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.620
 make a video and teaching him all 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.080
 the things that I bought well 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.880
 footprints and others leaving the links and everything 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.190
 everything all ok but I'll wait for me 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.390
 come the other things and well we go 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.180
 to wait for it to dry 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.180
 and then to file again that nail 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.159
 ok and then I will also use 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:57.579
 transparent enamel because it is the only thing 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:57.579
