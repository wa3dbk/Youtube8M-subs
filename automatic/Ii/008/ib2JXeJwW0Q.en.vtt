 hello to all I'm delighted to find you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.020

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.509

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.310
 beach 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.320
 so I always start by preparing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.970
 my beach bag without a joke 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.829

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.119
 purse in which I put the 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.220
 currency but I avoid everything that is 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 blue card et cetera I really take 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 the bare minimum because I do not have 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.130
 trust in the beach then I take 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.050
