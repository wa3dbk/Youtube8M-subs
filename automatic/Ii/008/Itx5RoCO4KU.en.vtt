 this time I bring you a little one 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.980
 program that does the same thing as the sap of 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.439
 player 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.360

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.150

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.190
 how to download and install it so 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's go with the video 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.070
 very good friends of youtube now yes 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.440
 let's start with the video of the day of 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.329
 today very well they are going to go here 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.829
 to the link that I will leave in the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 description of the video where they are worth 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 directed to my page the one drive 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.410
 This link is the will leave the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 description of the video and then here as 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 can see I have the various rar files 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.600
 of the 10 more videos here depends on 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.729
 files for the gta the equalizer 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 dolby theme dragon ball z well this is a 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.509
 very simple theme products also if 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.909
 that do not download a here is the one that we're going 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.180
 to occupy is this is the double windows 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.479
 player sap phone here click 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.850
 right they give you in download and then what 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.350
 located in a place where you 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 you can find me here I put it in the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.030
 desk because it's almost always where 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.440
 you should have for the test do not 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.870
 they give in extract here 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.490
 we hope and here is the program 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.050
 these two files it is important that you do not 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.060
 they will erase us because they are 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.270
 important to work the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.110
 application and for those who have windows 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.360
 8 and windows 8.1 should do this 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.910
 operation so that it works well 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.470
 program and do not fail them because this 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.570
 program is still not very well optimized 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.050
 by windows 8 then here in 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.210
 properties 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.310
 we hope and balance incompatibility 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.400
 here they give you run this program in 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.360
 Compatibility mode for and choose 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.130
 windows 7 here you give in run this 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.010
 program as administrator they give in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.330
 apply and accept what we do this for 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.340
 so that the program is optimized and 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.250
 works better with the pc because we 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.300
 we have the 8 or the 8.1 good they have 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.550
 the 7 do not need to do that 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.160
 well so then double- click 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.890
 in and 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.590
 is to do exactly exactly what 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.480
 same as the program for 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.210
 developers that comes in the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.400
 windows phone tool from the 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.090
 sdk this program is exactly what 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.490
 same and I think this is even better me 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.780
 He opened the program that brought him to sap 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.230
 files 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.830
 we wait for him to load and here they look for what 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 which is your where your files are that 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.300
 they want to load type ok sap there's who I 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.850
 I have it here my files here do not 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.390
 have and so here in this case I'm going to 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.950
 load the gta san andreas 512 mi mi 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.080
 own book the pp have open and here 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.600
 they are going to be automatically 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.270
 once ready to put you give in 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.530
 deploy and already but before I forgot 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.750
 tell them that before they open in the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.720
 program they have to have connected their 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.510
 windows phone is logical and well if he 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.660
 who deploys and that has been 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.100
 all sign was then I hope you 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.790
 I have solved your doubts 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.910
 mistakes and then anything send me 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.480

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.010
 windows hack facebook 8.1 update 1 already

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.750
 Doubts
