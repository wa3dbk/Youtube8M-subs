keep it sets of screws in separate piles

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
keep it sets of screws in separate piles
so<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.590> put<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.130> top<00:01:29.340> back

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
get stuck in there and this is where the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.630 
get stuck in there and this is where the
tweezers<00:01:48.000> come<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.770> we<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.979> use<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> tweezers

side<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.630> look<00:02:54.959> at<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.319> laptop<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.599> see

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
side and we look at the laptop so we see

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
side and we look at the laptop so we see
it's<00:02:58.019> an<00:02:58.230> LED<00:02:58.500> screen<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.610> there's<00:02:59.880> only

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
it's an LED screen because there's only

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.949 
it's an LED screen because there's only
one<00:03:00.510> connector<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.500> there<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:03.120> let's<00:03:03.810> see

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
one connector going there and let's see

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.220 
one connector going there and let's see
if<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.380> have<00:03:04.590> access<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.239> screws<00:03:06.510> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
if we have access to the screws that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.699 
if we have access to the screws that
screen<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.489> held<00:03:09.120> by<00:03:09.420> metal<00:03:09.840> brackets<00:03:10.319> on<00:03:10.500> both

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
screen is held by metal brackets on both

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.550 
screen is held by metal brackets on both
sides<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.340> there's<00:03:12.209> screws<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:12.930> both<00:03:13.260> sides

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
sides and there's screws on both sides

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.809 
sides and there's screws on both sides
here<00:03:13.859> and<00:03:14.010> here<00:03:14.310> now<00:03:14.660> with<00:03:15.660> most<00:03:16.200> laptops<00:03:16.819> it's

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
here and here now with most laptops it's

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.849 
here and here now with most laptops it's
harder<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> screws<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.620> have

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
harder to get to the screws so you have

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.490 
harder to get to the screws so you have
to<00:03:19.980> tuck<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.430> spring<00:03:20.730> forward<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.540> for

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
to tuck the spring forward on it for

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.289 
to tuck the spring forward on it for
this<00:03:22.590> particular<00:03:22.799> one<00:03:23.280> it's<00:03:23.549> real<00:03:23.850> easy<00:03:24.090> to

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
this particular one it's real easy to

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.069 
this particular one it's real easy to
get<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.900> screws<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:26.069> we<00:03:26.519> remove<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.810> two

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
get you the screws so we remove the two

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.030 
get you the screws so we remove the two
screws<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.799> each<00:03:29.160> side<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.139> once<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.620> also

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
screws on each side and once and also

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.610 
screws on each side and once and also
you<00:03:32.250> want<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.549> have<00:03:32.609> this<00:03:33.120> screen<00:03:33.930> tilted<00:03:34.410> back

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
you want to have this screen tilted back

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.259 
you want to have this screen tilted back
a<00:03:34.650> little<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.489> when<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.819> remove<00:03:35.910> all<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
a little bit so when you remove all the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.449 
a little bit so when you remove all the
screws<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.290> screen<00:03:37.590> doesn't<00:03:37.889> just<00:03:38.220> pop

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
screws the screen doesn't just pop

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:46.819 
screws the screen doesn't just pop
forward<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.950> one<00:03:42.109> two<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:45.350> same<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.590> this

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
forward on you one two and same on this

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.640 
forward on you one two and same on this
side<00:03:47.030> now<00:03:48.030> let's<00:03:48.299> see<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.630> side<00:03:48.959> has<00:03:49.260> three

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
side now let's see this side has three

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.270 
side now let's see this side has three
screws<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.400> miss<00:03:50.730> something<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.569> outside

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
screws we miss something on the outside

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.740 
screws we miss something on the outside
yes<00:03:53.280> we<00:03:53.519> did<00:03:53.700> we<00:03:53.730> missed<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.329> third<00:03:54.540> two

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
yes we did we missed the third two

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.770 
yes we did we missed the third two
screws<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.260> there's<00:03:55.850> three<00:03:56.850> screws<00:03:56.910> on<00:03:57.569> each

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
screws so there's three screws on each

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.110 
screws so there's three screws on each
side<00:03:58.139> okay<00:04:02.299> let's<00:04:03.299> go<00:04:03.480> back<00:04:03.750> over<00:04:04.079> here<00:04:04.530> and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
side okay let's go back over here and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.920 
side okay let's go back over here and
remove<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.480> screws

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
remove the screws

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.300 
remove the screws
one<00:04:09.709> by<00:04:10.129> one<00:04:10.159> as<00:04:11.409> you<00:04:12.409> can<00:04:12.470> see<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.040> is<00:04:13.280> a

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
one by one as you can see this is a

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.330 
one by one as you can see this is a
fairly<00:04:13.909> simple<00:04:14.599> laptop<00:04:15.379> to<00:04:15.620> replace<00:04:16.009> the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
fairly simple laptop to replace the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.710 
fairly simple laptop to replace the
screen<00:04:16.759> on<00:04:17.000> no<00:04:17.989> major<00:04:18.259> hangups

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
screen on no major hangups

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.460 
screen on no major hangups
which<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.900> good<00:04:21.850> okay<00:04:22.850> we<00:04:23.690> get<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.199> third

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
which is good okay we get to the third

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.350 
which is good okay we get to the third
screw

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.640 

okay<00:04:32.360> so<00:04:33.050> listen

okay so listen
but<00:04:33.890> here<00:04:34.190> comes<00:04:35.500> okay<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:36.560> next<00:04:37.070> thing<00:04:37.310> once

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
but here comes okay so next thing once

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.750 
but here comes okay so next thing once
we<00:04:38.030> do<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.510> we<00:04:38.810> tilt<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.650> screen<00:04:40.100> forward

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
we do that is we tilt the screen forward

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.870 
we do that is we tilt the screen forward
sometimes<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.570> webcam<00:04:42.050> cable<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:43.580> should

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
sometimes the webcam cable that should

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.210 
sometimes the webcam cable that should
me<00:04:44.030> show<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.270> sometimes<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:45.110> webcam<00:04:45.560> cable<00:04:46.040> is

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
me show you sometimes a webcam cable is

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.460 
me show you sometimes a webcam cable is
has<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.910> piece<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:47.780> it's<00:04:47.900> stuck<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
has a piece of and it's stuck to the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.830 
has a piece of and it's stuck to the
back<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.920> screen<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:50.000> we<00:04:50.240> do<00:04:50.360> remove<00:04:50.660> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
back of the screen so we do remove the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.290 
back of the screen so we do remove the
webcam<00:04:51.320> connector<00:04:51.890> or<00:04:52.130> we<00:04:52.580> will<00:04:52.850> cut<00:04:53.120> the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
webcam connector or we will cut the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.000 
webcam connector or we will cut the
cable<00:04:53.720> this<00:04:54.080> case<00:04:54.670> we<00:04:55.670> lift<00:04:55.910> up<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.150> cable<00:04:56.690> and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
cable this case we lift up the cable and

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.740 
cable this case we lift up the cable and
now<00:04:58.010> we<00:04:58.730> have<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.270> screen<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:01.670> this<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.180> right

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
now we have the screen so this is right

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.080 
now we have the screen so this is right
here<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.800> only<00:05:03.830> connector<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.760> we<00:05:04.910> have

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
here is the only connector that we have

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.010 
here is the only connector that we have
to<00:05:05.270> take<00:05:05.480> care<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:06.520> so<00:05:07.520> there's<00:05:07.760> some<00:05:08.060> adhesive

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
to take care of so there's some adhesive

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.520 
to take care of so there's some adhesive
tape<00:05:09.350> on<00:05:09.560> top<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.310> connector<00:05:11.080> we<00:05:12.080> remove

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
tape on top of the connector we remove

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.630 
tape on top of the connector we remove
that<00:05:12.740> first<00:05:13.010> slowly<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.800> this<00:05:16.130> is<00:05:16.280> a<00:05:16.310> pretty

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
that first slowly so this is a pretty

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.220 
that first slowly so this is a pretty
delicate<00:05:16.880> connector<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:17.750> we<00:05:17.780> don't<00:05:18.020> want<00:05:18.170> to

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
delicate connector so we don't want to

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.610 
delicate connector so we don't want to
damage<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:20.200> take<00:05:21.200> your<00:05:21.380> time<00:05:21.620> on<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:23.590> try<00:05:24.590> to

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
damage it take your time on this try to

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.680 
damage it take your time on this try to
hold<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.100> tape<00:05:25.430> down<00:05:25.700> so<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.240> doesn't<00:05:26.600> all

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
hold the tape down so it doesn't all

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.350 
hold the tape down so it doesn't all
come<00:05:26.720> off<00:05:27.080> at<00:05:27.260> once<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.740> grab<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:28.850> connector
