00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it to the power supply and see what

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.439 
it to the power supply and see what
happens<00:00:47.660> okay<00:00:48.660> let's<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.710> happens

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.689 

ecstatic<00:00:58.489> but<00:00:59.489> no<00:00:59.699> action<00:01:01.219> okay<00:01:02.219> let's<00:01:02.520> open

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
ecstatic but no action okay let's open

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.579 
ecstatic but no action okay let's open
it<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.840> fixed

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it up and see if it can be fixed

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.730 
it up and see if it can be fixed
oh<00:01:07.850> wow<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.360> warming<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> acting<00:01:10.590> like

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
oh wow it's warming up and acting like

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.649 
oh wow it's warming up and acting like
it's<00:01:10.950> trying<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.549> something<00:01:14.509> well<00:01:15.509> that's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's trying to do something well that's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's trying to do something well that's
we<00:01:15.930> maybe<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> capacitor<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.150> needed

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
we maybe we had a capacitor that needed

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
we maybe we had a capacitor that needed
some<00:01:18.689> slight<00:01:19.049> repairman<00:01:19.830> control<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
some slight repairman control now the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.420 
some slight repairman control now the
systems<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.150> clean<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> quiet<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.430> use

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
systems are clean and quiet and use

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.940

deluxe model it has six transistors in
it<00:01:47.910> instead<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.060> usual<00:01:49.479> four<00:01:49.750> or<00:01:49.960> five

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it instead of the usual four or five

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.820 
it instead of the usual four or five
okay<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.390> went<00:01:52.660> ahead<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.900> clean<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.440> volume

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
okay I went ahead and clean the volume

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.240 
okay I went ahead and clean the volume
control<00:01:54.310> with<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.729> control<00:01:55.240> cleaner<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
control with the control cleaner it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.580 
control with the control cleaner it
seems<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.729> be<00:01:57.880> working<00:01:58.090> okay<00:01:58.720> now<00:01:59.020> so<00:01:59.440> we'll

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
seems to be working okay now so we'll

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.340 
seems to be working okay now so we'll
put<00:01:59.860> it<00:01:59.950> back<00:01:59.979> together<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.990> should<00:02:02.170> be

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
put it back together and it should be

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:24.210 
put it back together and it should be
good<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.710> go

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the oldies are envy station it really

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.570 
the oldies are envy station it really
puts<00:02:28.099> out<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> lousy<00:02:28.670> signal<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.549> coupled<00:02:31.549> with

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
puts out a lousy signal and coupled with

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.580 
puts out a lousy signal and coupled with
the<00:02:31.730> radio<00:02:32.120> that's<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.930> great<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.440> begin

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the radio that's not that great to begin

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.369 
the radio that's not that great to begin
with<00:02:34.209> doesn't<00:02:35.209> make<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.690> very<00:02:35.720> enjoyable

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379
