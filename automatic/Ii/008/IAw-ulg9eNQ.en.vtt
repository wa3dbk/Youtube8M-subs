Yuri<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> question<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.600> how<00:02:18.720> much<00:02:18.870> this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
Yuri but the question is how much this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.400 
Yuri but the question is how much this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
that I think we're both cheated that's a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
that I think we're both cheated that's a
shame<00:02:24.930> because<00:02:25.140> I've<00:02:25.650> been<00:02:25.770> looking<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.130> caño

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
shame because I've been looking at caño

shame because I've been looking at caño
as<00:02:26.820> one<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.240> better<00:02:27.420> fighters<00:02:27.780> ever<00:02:28.320> no
