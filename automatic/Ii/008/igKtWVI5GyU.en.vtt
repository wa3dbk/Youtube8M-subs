total you can add up to three apartments

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
total you can add up to three apartments
which<00:00:37.890> means<00:00:38.160> you're<00:00:38.309> gonna<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.489> 60<00:00:38.879> cars

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
which means you're gonna have 60 cars

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
which means you're gonna have 60 cars
and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.260> reason<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.860> 60<00:00:41.250> cars<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and the reason you can have 60 cars is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940 
and the reason you can have 60 cars is
because<00:00:41.910> each<00:00:42.270> apartment<00:00:42.600> holds<00:00:43.110> 20<00:00:43.410> cars<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
because each apartment holds 20 cars so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.700 
because each apartment holds 20 cars so
20<00:00:44.280> times<00:00:44.489> 3<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.030> 60<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> already<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.530> 2
