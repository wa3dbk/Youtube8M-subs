00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.470
 new video is all I bring as 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.290
 teleport in gta 5 online in the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.599
 version 1.0 6 this remarked it because if 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.090
 you are in updates or things 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.080
 higher then it will be good for me I think good 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.030
 We're going to have to create you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.190
 mainly an account in social club 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 what is the rockstar games this that you 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.730
 you have to create it is very easily 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'm from a password an email 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 email you send an email to your 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.869
 hotmail and there you verify it good 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.400
 let's go for it we have to do what 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.439
 next when we have created the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.420
 account we have to do this let's go 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.730
 to the map we take the destination we want to go to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.350
 if to a race for example we go from 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.000
 the airport then to the airport 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.579
 of trevor we do not see that race as it 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.620
 flame is called to the wind as you see there 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 the left puts the wind we stay 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 with that name to know more or less 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.649
 where are you where to locate it and we are going to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 online we are going to have to go online 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.879
 list of games and create a game 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 this will leave us if you have not done the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.050
 social club account as I have already 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 said and well let's find it is there 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.300
 the wind We select and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.700
 we are going to give back so that we can 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 save the starting list 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.430
 we keep this all this I am 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 creating so there is no problem 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 by then for the comments of that and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.399
 we keep it as soon as it is saved 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 we put a name I put trevor for 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.570
 that there is no problem and I do not 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.390
 mistake another list with another 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.590
 of games I only have two so that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.319
 I'm wrong so you can see 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.000
 you here we complete it and we go 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.030
 to my list of games we choose the one of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.649
 clover and in the clover there is no longer 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.360
 we have no problem is going to do the 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.679
 kinematics without any problem is troops 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 a quick camera to you will go more 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.789
 slowly so that it makes us longer 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 video and we're here now we have 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.990
 to give to the circle and go out as you see 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.549
 we go out normal and we're already out in the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.030
 empty here we can take a charge 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.799
 bobo a titan or anything that 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.989
 you have at the airport of trevor and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.569
 is that would be very easy very fast 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.610
 so you do not have to be traveling 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.349
 the whole map that takes fifteen minutes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.729
 in going from one place to another nothing else would be 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.479
 I hope that you have liked to give 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.479
 like and see you next goodbye 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.800
