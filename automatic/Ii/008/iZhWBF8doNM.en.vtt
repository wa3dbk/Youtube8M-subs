00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.360 

biggest<00:02:27.430> thing<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:28.000> had<00:02:28.150> ever<00:02:28.450> done<00:02:29.370> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
biggest thing that we had ever done so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:41.550 
biggest thing that we had ever done so
for<00:02:30.610> us<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:31.000> about<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:40.560> think

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
for us to think about that I think

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.890 
for us to think about that I think
someone<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.519> other<00:02:42.610> day<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.660> will

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
someone the other day that this will

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.350 
someone the other day that this will
either<00:02:44.110> be<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:45.129> green<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.579> success<00:02:45.970> or<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
either be the green the success or the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.680 
either be the green the success or the
greatest<00:02:46.930> failure<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.879> I<00:02:48.970> really<00:02:49.329> mean<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
greatest failure and I really mean that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.830 
greatest failure and I really mean that
in<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.930> best<00:02:50.170> way<00:02:50.349> possible<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.540> people

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
in the best way possible for the people

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.050 
in the best way possible for the people
who<00:02:53.019> are<00:02:53.109> only<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:53.799> their<00:02:54.129> particular<00:02:54.519> stories

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
who are only in their particular stories

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.059 
who are only in their particular stories
I<00:02:55.180> think<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:55.569> still<00:02:55.750> totally<00:02:56.140> crazy<00:02:56.799> for

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
I think it's still totally crazy for

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.410 
I think it's still totally crazy for
them<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.459> know<00:02:57.579> because<00:02:57.760> they<00:02:57.940> both<00:02:58.090> see<00:02:58.329> it

and they're like what's going on over
there<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.959> make<00:03:02.170> sense<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.920> doesn't<00:03:03.069> make

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
there this make sense it doesn't make

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.400

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
right

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:05.780 
right
this<00:03:58.950> could<00:03:59.159> be<00:03:59.280> serious<00:04:04.639> everyone's<00:04:05.639> asking

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
this could be serious everyone's asking

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.789 
this could be serious everyone's asking
me<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.359> define<00:04:06.689> it<00:04:06.810> but<00:04:06.959> what<00:04:07.139> it's<00:04:07.290> not<00:04:07.500> is

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
me to define it but what it's not is

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.759 
me to define it but what it's not is
just<00:04:08.219> going<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.459> be<00:04:08.609> silly<00:04:09.290> fun<00:04:10.290> kind<00:04:10.680> of

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
just going to be silly fun kind of

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.710 
just going to be silly fun kind of
running<00:04:11.099> around<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.489> state<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.060> think<00:04:12.599> it'll

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
running around the state I think it'll

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.410 
running around the state I think it'll
have<00:04:13.489> touching<00:04:14.489> moments<00:04:14.879> and<00:04:15.030> profound

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
have touching moments and profound

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.779 
have touching moments and profound
moments<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.139> some<00:04:16.470> truths<00:04:16.769> which<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.639> the

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
moments and some truths which is the

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.509 
moments and some truths which is the
underlying<00:04:18.180> theme<00:04:18.509> of<00:04:18.870> humor<00:04:19.139> and<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
underlying theme of humor and this is a

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.360 
underlying theme of humor and this is a
quintessential<00:04:21.239> Chicago<00:04:22.049> fact<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.919> don't

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
quintessential Chicago fact I don't

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.779 
quintessential Chicago fact I don't
think<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.699> doesn't<00:04:24.210> happen<00:04:24.360> elsewhere

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789
