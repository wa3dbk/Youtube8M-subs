 motorola provides next to the terminal a micro sd card of 2 gigs what 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.610
 it is not enough to handle multimedia contents 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.870
 the good part is that it is not necessary to remove the battery to remove the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.000
 sim card or to add a new micro sd card with what you do not have to

 The terminal offers a range of 36 hours, which is why we recommend modifying 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.399
 the constant use of 3g communications 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.939
 otherwise it is a terminal that unifies the services will allow me 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.349
 be constantly connected
