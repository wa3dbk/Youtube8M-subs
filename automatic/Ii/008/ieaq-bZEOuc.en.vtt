youtube channel I am doing a review on

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.519 
youtube channel I am doing a review on
the<00:00:09.650> Elector<00:00:10.219> new<00:00:10.780> limit<00:00:11.780> electro<00:00:12.680> splash<00:00:13.100> and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:14.529 
the Elector new limit electro splash and

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.140 
the Elector new limit electro splash and
there's<00:00:15.529> only<00:00:15.650> one<00:00:15.920> other<00:00:16.070> video<00:00:16.250> on<00:00:16.460> YouTube

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
there's only one other video on YouTube

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.140 
there's only one other video on YouTube
and<00:00:17.330> it's<00:00:17.449> by<00:00:18.880> B<00:00:19.880> to<00:00:21.099> be<00:00:22.099> 2k<00:00:22.310> lighting<00:00:22.849> effects

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
and it's by B to be 2k lighting effects

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.239 
and it's by B to be 2k lighting effects
I<00:00:23.390> guess<00:00:23.539> is<00:00:23.689> what<00:00:23.839> they're<00:00:23.960> called

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
I guess is what they're called

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.269 
I guess is what they're called
I<00:00:25.509> wanted<00:00:26.509> to<00:00:26.619> thought<00:00:27.619> I'd<00:00:27.740> give<00:00:27.890> this<00:00:28.009> light

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
I wanted to thought I'd give this light

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.970 
I wanted to thought I'd give this light
a<00:00:28.310> shot<00:00:28.669> on<00:00:28.910> because<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:29.869> it<00:00:30.349> was<00:00:30.829> only

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
a shot on because it's that it was only

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.810 
a shot on because it's that it was only
like<00:00:31.720> 45<00:00:32.720> dollars<00:00:33.760> with<00:00:34.760> Free<00:00:34.940> Shipping<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.690> I

like 45 dollars with Free Shipping and I

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.480 
like 45 dollars with Free Shipping and I
when<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> saw<00:00:38.060> the<00:00:38.120> video<00:00:38.330> by<00:00:38.840> b2<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.560> thought<00:00:40.460> I

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
when I saw the video by b2 I thought I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.050 
when I saw the video by b2 I thought I
had<00:00:40.670> kind<00:00:40.850> of<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.120> nifty<00:00:41.420> little<00:00:42.850> pad<00:00:43.850> or<00:00:44.030> a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
light pattern to it it was led when I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.370 
light pattern to it it was led when I
actually<00:00:47.030> got<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.420> in<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.690> mail<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.930> thought

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
kind of like the LX 5 only the pattern

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.929 
kind of like the LX 5 only the pattern
is<00:01:15.079> slightly<00:01:15.409> different<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.249> it<00:01:16.429> has<00:01:16.670> white

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
is slightly different and it has white

is slightly different and it has white
in<00:01:16.969> it<00:01:17.240> which<00:01:17.420> is<00:01:17.570> really<00:01:17.689> cool<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.710> weight<00:01:18.920> is

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
in it which is really cool the weight is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.039 
in it which is really cool the weight is
only<00:01:19.310> one<00:01:19.609> pound<00:01:20.109> the<00:01:21.109> size<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.799> on<00:01:22.030> 7<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.270> 3/4

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
only one pound the size is on 7 and 3/4

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.969 
only one pound the size is on 7 and 3/4
by<00:01:24.289> seven<00:01:25.069> and<00:01:25.219> a<00:01:25.310> half<00:01:25.719> inches<00:01:26.979> supplying

by seven and a half inches supplying

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.899 
by seven and a half inches supplying
voltage<00:01:28.399> is<00:01:28.549> obviously<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.359> hundred<00:01:30.909> depending

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
voltage is obviously a hundred depending

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.719 
voltage is obviously a hundred depending
on<00:01:31.999> where<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.210> live<00:01:32.389> it's<00:01:32.600> 240<00:01:33.729> power

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
on where you live it's 240 power

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.730 
on where you live it's 240 power
consumption<00:01:35.299> is<00:01:35.420> only<00:01:35.479> 10<00:01:35.810> watts<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.409> beam

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
consumption is only 10 watts and beam

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770 
consumption is only 10 watts and beam
angles<00:01:37.130> actually<00:01:37.399> 30<00:01:37.880> degrees<00:01:38.240> on<00:01:38.270> which<00:01:38.659> is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
angles actually 30 degrees on which is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.499 
angles actually 30 degrees on which is
actually<00:01:39.429> pretty<00:01:40.429> decent<00:01:40.639> for<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.119> small<00:01:41.359> of

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
actually pretty decent for this small of

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.969 
actually pretty decent for this small of
the<00:01:41.569> light<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:43.729> also<00:01:43.850> came<00:01:44.149> with<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:44.979> funky

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the light it also came with this funky

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.889 
the light it also came with this funky
thing<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.609> don't<00:01:46.670> know<00:01:47.119> if<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.780> to

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
thing and I don't know if this is to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.760 
thing and I don't know if this is to
actually<00:01:48.170> hang<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.969> or<00:01:49.969> what<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.649> it's<00:01:51.649> like<00:01:51.740> a

thing that lighting effects in hover was

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.190 
thing that lighting effects in hover was
the<00:02:04.609> fact<00:02:04.880> that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200

type lighting other than that used to be
pretty<00:03:14.329> decent<00:03:14.480> light<00:03:14.900> I've<00:03:15.109> had<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.410> plugged

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
pretty decent light I've had it plugged

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.400 
pretty decent light I've had it plugged
in<00:03:15.709> let's<00:03:16.310> take<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.850> into<00:03:17.180> my<00:03:17.480> living<00:03:18.200> room<00:03:18.260> is

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
not that big but I'm going to be using

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.710 
not that big but I'm going to be using
it<00:03:20.630> tomorrow<00:03:21.250> at<00:03:22.250> another<00:03:22.639> gay<00:03:22.940> at<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.329> gig<00:03:23.690> for

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
the first time and I'm going to see what

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.210 
the first time and I'm going to see what
the<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.480> actual<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.109> see<00:03:27.739> how<00:03:27.859> much<00:03:28.010> of

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the the actual on see how much of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.539 
the the actual on see how much of
coverage<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.769> takes<00:03:30.769> up<00:03:30.980> on<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> dance<00:03:31.370> floor

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
coverage it it takes up on a dance floor

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.759 
coverage it it takes up on a dance floor
so<00:03:32.000> I'm<00:03:32.450> going<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.660> pause<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.380> let's

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
so I'm going to pause this and let's

00:03:33.769 --> 00:04:47.920 
so I'm going to pause this and let's
take<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.010> into<00:03:34.250> my<00:03:34.280> living<00:03:34.489> room<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:34.910> see<00:03:35.299> what

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.130 

then<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.350> there<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.680> go<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.040> electro<00:04:51.140> splash

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
then so there you go the electro splash

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.310 
then so there you go the electro splash
live<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.920> made<00:04:53.160> by<00:04:53.310> eliminator<00:04:53.850> um<00:04:54.320> I

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
live I made by eliminator um I

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.300 
live I made by eliminator um I
particularly<00:04:56.190> like<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:56.970> for<00:04:57.890> $45<00:04:58.890> or

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
particularly like it I for $45 or

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.180 
particularly like it I for $45 or
actually<00:04:59.640> I<00:04:59.670> think<00:04:59.760> I<00:04:59.880> paid<00:05:00.030> 41<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.860> was<00:05:02.100> like

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
actually I think I paid 41 it was like

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.190 
actually I think I paid 41 it was like
41<00:05:02.760> free<00:05:03.090> shipping<00:05:03.510> I<00:05:03.840> think<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.080> was<00:05:04.170> a

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
41 free shipping I think it was a

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.650 
41 free shipping I think it was a
special<00:05:04.470> deal<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:05.910> think<00:05:06.150> regular<00:05:06.270> price

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
special deal but I think regular price

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.770 
special deal but I think regular price
is<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.050> 59<00:05:07.980> I<00:05:08.010> think<00:05:09.860> for<00:05:11.150> for<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.180> price<00:05:12.450> like

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
is like 59 I think for for a price like

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.540 
is like 59 I think for for a price like
this<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:13.230> can't<00:05:13.470> beat<00:05:13.740> it

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
this you can't beat it

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.340 
this you can't beat it
the<00:05:14.880> pattern<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.420> look<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.750> just<00:05:15.780> particular

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
the pattern I look I just particular

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.910 
the pattern I look I just particular
love<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.770> pattern<00:05:17.130> on<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.860> said

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
love the pattern on it and like I said

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.530 
love the pattern on it and like I said
it's<00:05:20.250> light<00:05:20.520> it'll<00:05:20.790> be<00:05:20.970> real<00:05:21.120> good<00:05:21.270> for<00:05:21.420> my

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
it's light it'll be real good for my

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.820 
it's light it'll be real good for my
wife<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.900> hang<00:05:22.130> up<00:05:23.130> on<00:05:23.280> my<00:05:23.400> truss<00:05:23.730> and<00:05:24.830> won't

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
wife to hang up on my truss and won't

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.770 
wife to hang up on my truss and won't
have<00:05:25.980> to<00:05:26.130> carry<00:05:26.580> any<00:05:26.820> heavy<00:05:27.000> lighting<00:05:27.480> with<00:05:27.630> me

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
have to carry any heavy lighting with me

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.080 
have to carry any heavy lighting with me
it<00:05:28.470> seems<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:28.920> cover<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.220> pretty<00:05:29.490> decent<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:30.060> mean

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
it seems to cover a pretty decent I mean

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.470 
it seems to cover a pretty decent I mean
area<00:05:30.690> from<00:05:31.110> where<00:05:31.320> I<00:05:31.350> am<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:32.090> think<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.240> bigger

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
area from where I am I think the bigger

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.270 
area from where I am I think the bigger
you<00:05:34.200> know<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.440> farther<00:05:34.770> way<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.010> can

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
you know the farther way you can

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.000 
you know the farther way you can
actually<00:05:35.460> have<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:35.970> light<00:05:36.740> probably<00:05:37.740> has<00:05:37.980> a

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
actually have the light probably has a

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.780 
actually have the light probably has a
bigger<00:05:38.420> bigger<00:05:39.420> coverage<00:05:39.990> on<00:05:40.290> I<00:05:40.320> mean<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.520> I

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
bigger bigger coverage on I mean that I

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.760 
bigger bigger coverage on I mean that I
think<00:05:42.780> one<00:05:43.290> would<00:05:43.470> cover<00:05:44.570> at<00:05:45.570> least<00:05:45.900> us<00:05:46.170> is<00:05:46.440> at

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
think one would cover at least us is at
