00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi loves in today's video I'm going 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.410
 teach you how to do 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.690
 racing prints using justiceira 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.750
 we'll need a free fair 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.130
 ink to have had of the mold of the drawing 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.710
 of your choice of scissors sharpener 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 and a white regatta 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.070
 so let's start by trimming the whole 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.070
 our name 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.540
 Let's do it every day. 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.450
 to be 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.790
 let's enjoy only these flour 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.600
 is as if it were point of the 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.750
 sides 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.320
 let's enjoy the fans and see our 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.320
 design 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:33.620
 now let's stretch the regatta and let's 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 a wood or something a little harder 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.520
 a cardboard 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.240
 so in the middle of the race to avoid 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.340
 today melt and send the back 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.450
 the race 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 now we're going to set up our drawing 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 chosen 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.110
 Let's pretend like it's a break. 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.020
 heads are not right there 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 so that everything is like drawing 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.110
 original 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:08.119
 Now we're just going to fill our 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.710
 drawing on paper only with heading 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.040
 It looks like we're going for koji wax 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.040
 colorful unite 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.260
 now with drawings all over the park 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.950
 and we will pass the heated iron over 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.599
 thus melting today by informing our 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.599
 stamp in our race 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:06.110
 now just take the legal sheet from above 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.069
 the drawing and taking out the mold and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.810
 It's our drawing, it's our 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.019
 racing print 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.290
 Who would prefer to leave it spotted? 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.780
 Dirty and even with the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.819
 drained gets super interesting super 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.090
 beautiful but for those who do not like to be 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.090
 made little of the days we'll get to 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.200
 white fabric paint and brush 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.040
 little dolphin 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.909
 Let's go through the retouching process. 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.909
 top of the good ones 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.010
 I passed the white ink for adoption at 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.810
 You, but I confess that after I 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.680
 I spent the white paint 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.020
 I would rather leave him with the good ones. 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.410
 and got the go 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.410
 but there goes from the taste of each one of you 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.500
 and so it was ours and a cat with a stamp 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.069
 we made it ourselves you can 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.379
 to choose any design is a good ballot 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.489
 flower I chose the symbol of peace and 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.620
 I liked it more 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.109
 So I met my loves and I hope that 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.070
 You liked this super video. 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.070
 A kiss he gave
