pistol<00:02:35.600> kind<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.690> looks<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.080> same<00:02:37.290> one

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
pistol kind of looks like the same one

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.730 
pistol kind of looks like the same one
that<00:02:37.830> comes<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.370> call<00:02:38.640> fast<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.570> figure<00:02:39.900> but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
that comes with call fast the figure but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.140 
that comes with call fast the figure but
it's<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.160> different<00:02:41.370> because<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:42.030> got

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
it's a little different because it's got

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.600 
it's a little different because it's got
like<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.390> handle<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.530> trigger<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
like a handle for the trigger as a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.060 
like a handle for the trigger as a
little<00:02:45.390> longer<00:02:45.570> instead<00:02:45.870> scope<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.470> I'm<00:02:46.950> not

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
little longer instead scope on I'm not

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.250 
little longer instead scope on I'm not
sure<00:02:47.160> what<00:02:47.490> exactly<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.390> from<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.110> might

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
sure what exactly this is from it might

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.130 
sure what exactly this is from it might
be<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> new<00:02:49.590> Colt<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.280> not<00:02:50.430> sure<00:02:51.140> it's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
be a new Colt but I'm not sure it's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.780 
be a new Colt but I'm not sure it's
pretty<00:02:52.410> cool<00:02:52.560> looking<00:02:52.710> no<00:02:53.370> see<00:02:53.550> he's<00:02:53.640> got

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
pretty cool looking no see he's got

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.850 
pretty cool looking no see he's got
these<00:02:53.940> brand-new<00:02:54.300> sculpted<00:02:54.810> goggles<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:55.709> not

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
these brand-new sculpted goggles I'm not

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.170 
these brand-new sculpted goggles I'm not
sure<00:02:55.920> how<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.250> fit<00:02:56.459> him<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.700> his<00:02:56.820> head<00:02:56.970> though

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
sure how you fit him on his head though

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.320 
sure how you fit him on his head though
because<00:02:57.740> these<00:02:58.740> little<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.400> horns<00:02:59.910> he's<00:03:00.060> got

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
because these little like horns he's got

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.010 
because these little like horns he's got
but<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.770> pretty<00:03:02.040> cool-looking<00:03:02.310> oh<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.720> they

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
but the pretty cool-looking oh now they

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.630 
but the pretty cool-looking oh now they
can<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.260> used<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.680> another<00:03:05.190> figure<00:03:05.459> or

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
can be used on another figure or

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.460 
can be used on another figure or
something<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.020> using<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.500> holder

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
something but I just using the holder

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.320 
something but I just using the holder
articulations<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.310> great<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.060> this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
articulations not that great for this

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.660 
articulations not that great for this
figure<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.780> mean<00:03:13.020> he's<00:03:13.230> got<00:03:13.410> swivel<00:03:13.680> head<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
figure I mean he's got swivel head but I

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.910 
figure I mean he's got swivel head but I
think<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.090> ball<00:03:15.270> joy<00:03:15.450> did<00:03:15.690> actually<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.739> it

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
think it's ball joy did actually but it

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.010 
think it's ball joy did actually but it
can<00:03:17.040> only<00:03:17.160> swivel<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:18.600> it's<00:03:18.720> got<00:03:18.870> vaulted

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
can only swivel then it's got vaulted

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.290 
can only swivel then it's got vaulted
shoulders<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.070> then<00:03:20.580> his<00:03:20.730> elbows<00:03:21.120> are

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
shoulders and then his elbows are

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.600 
shoulders and then his elbows are
supposed<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.810> ball<00:03:22.320> jointed<00:03:22.770> but<00:03:23.070> mine

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
supposed to be ball jointed but mine

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.190 
supposed to be ball jointed but mine
won't<00:03:23.790> move<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.209> all<00:03:24.330> they're<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.080> like

won't move at all they're just like
stuck<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.650> position<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.280> don't<00:03:26.850> know

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
stuck in the position I don't know

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.830
