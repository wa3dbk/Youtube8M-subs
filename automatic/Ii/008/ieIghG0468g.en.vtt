00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
yeah I'm not sure I mean I mean does the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.369 
yeah I'm not sure I mean I mean does the
public<00:03:53.090> think<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.659> oh<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.019> is<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.199> team

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
public think that oh this is the team

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:58.659 
won 10 games and they'll snap out of it
I<00:03:57.530> mean<00:03:57.650> Oakland<00:03:57.979> hasn't<00:03:58.340> been<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.639> the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
I mean Oakland hasn't been to the

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.580 
I mean Oakland hasn't been to the
playoffs<00:03:59.030> in<00:03:59.180> forever<00:03:59.509> so<00:03:59.629> I'm<00:04:00.199> not<00:04:00.409> sure

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
playoffs in forever so I'm not sure

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.199 
playoffs in forever so I'm not sure
which<00:04:00.799> where<00:04:01.009> the<00:04:01.129> public<00:04:01.489> is<00:04:01.669> going<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:02.030> go

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.959 
here I think the last I checked at crisp
it<00:04:05.150> was<00:04:05.299> kind<00:04:05.569> of<00:04:05.629> maybe<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.229> know<00:04:06.349> 63<00:04:07.040> 37<00:04:07.310> on

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.020 
I'm just wondering does the line not
make<00:04:24.169> you<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.320> little<00:04:24.530> bit<00:04:24.650> nervous<00:04:24.860> why<00:04:25.759> is<00:04:25.820> it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
make you a little bit nervous why is it

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.360

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
where it is well I think it is where it

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.399 
where it is well I think it is where it
is<00:04:28.460> from<00:04:28.610> last<00:04:28.880> year<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.270> know<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.169> power

is from last year you know the the power

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.230 
is from last year you know the the power
ratings<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.370> teams<00:04:31.610> going<00:04:31.940> into<00:04:32.120> the

ratings of the teams going into the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.909 
ratings of the teams going into the

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
season I mean clearly you know the

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.860
