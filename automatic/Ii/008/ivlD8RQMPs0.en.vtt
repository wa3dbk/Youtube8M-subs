00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.670
 or the obese smugglers today I 'm going to 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.280
 talk about the indycar as well indicates the 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.350
 title of the video because it is about to 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.570
 start the season and we come from two 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.400
 collective training days where 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.890
 we have tested the new kits 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.870
 aerodynamic wave and chevrolet to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.400
 it seems the gringos have grown tired of 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.200
 to be criticized for having a 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.330
 body simpler than the mechanism 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.879
 of a pacifier for all the equipment and 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.039
 Then come have said that each manufacturer 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.960
 a design occurs and this is the 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.999
 result that has been taken out of the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.820
 manga and this other is the work of 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:45.039
 chevrolet as you see they have filled everything 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.679
 of appendix parts briefcases and 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.800
 various attachments in the style of bmw 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.620
 Sauber 2008 to see the idea is not bad 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600
 but I think they have gone a little 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.129
 hahahahaha with so much flap has added 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.199
 you will have to keep an eye on the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.359
 races because any touch will be 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.819
 susceptible to fuck you half car and 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.250
 fill the debris track and in the 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.440
 pit stops but blocks the car 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.360
 on your site you can hit them a host 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.220
 to your mechanics or you can even 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.600
 cut into pieces as if they were a 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.330
 pepperoni fuck 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.549
 Here I leave a picture of my car that I know 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.740
 that you are wanting it beyond 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.240
 aesthetic considerations field in the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.430
 that you already know that I am everything 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.590
 Professor, the truth is that if we take 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.840
 a look at the combined times of 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.640
 the two days of testing we see that the six 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.680
 first and eight of the first ten 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.570
 they were drivers of chevrolet teams 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.970
 so they seem to be one step 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.130
 in front of the waves right now for bad 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.310
 lucky for me and the first six 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.440
 four are the penske men though 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.780
 Well obviously we will not give the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.850
 battle for loss before starting now 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.490
 that my tenth best time is not an evil 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 starting point and by the records that 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.700
 have been given it seems that the new 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.119
 cars are going to be two or even three 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.399
 seconds faster than those of 2014 by 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.350
 true these new aerodynamic kits 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.270
 will not be used in the ovals where 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.640
 those plane ailerons will follow 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.380
 ties of always and that you know that 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.179
 they have also been trying 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.799
 position indicators in the part 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.780
 side of the cars with the 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.209
 intention to use them from 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.920
 indianápolis took the opportunity to comment 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.240
 other current issues of the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 category 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.560
 for the ass of the cntu not as ya 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.080
 I said in the introductory video to the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.150
 indy sergio caramba was confirmed as 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.030
 the fourth pilot of desire and at least 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.240
 for the first race I missed saying and 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.280
 if he does not deny me what xd xd but now 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.350
 the kid has broken a hand to the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.690
 look after doing a handful 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.360
 so maybe it's going to have to 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.070
 be left with the desire to run two 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.200
 the ass as god 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.030
 simón to the wild whose attempt by 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.770
 run in formula 1 with your credit 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.780
 unsuccessful returns in indie with 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.380
 andretti also at least in the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.020
 first race and 3 you put it andres the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.610
 dale coyné team has done it again 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.920
 usual platform for presumed 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.140
 pilots whose only endorsement is to provide 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.450
 a good pasture this year has not been lacking 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.550
 to his tradition and he presents us with an eye 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.340
 data on the one hand to Carlos the gardener 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.900
 a pilot who already competed for the same 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.150
 team last year and achieved a 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.530
 amazing victory in houston thank you 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.710
 to the rain and a lucky one 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.960
 strategy but other than that just 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.040
 got in twice between the 10 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.810
 first 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.030
 and that in urban circuits or 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.010
 permanent because the ovals came 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 as big as my shirts 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.780
 total falete that we already have a car 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.519
 broom for the ovals if not 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.250
 abandons before by decomposition 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.079
 irreversible bowel here I have to 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.970
 make a parenthesis so as not to lose 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.819
 visualizations of colombia 'that I'm 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.799
 getting this year to see friends what 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.379
 I feel but your compatriot is wrong and I 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.389
 things as they are but to see 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.400
 I fall you well too them 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.040
 I'll say the other carlos a nice name 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 by the way the stump is a very top driver 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.889
 I close parentheses and on the other hand and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.049
 even worse turned off an Italian dragon 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.840
 that was already in the category in 2010 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.669
 making a fool of himself in two races and 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.439
 that in the tests has been last and with a 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.629
 abysmal difference 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.329
 in a few words banana version 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.109
 male in short that has been all for 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.470
 today 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.579
 to see if I exceed the 500 reproductions 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.579
 greetings and happy weekend
