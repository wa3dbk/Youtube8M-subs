00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.190
 If I deaf, I recommend that you pass it 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.879
 because it is like messy medium the 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.879
 quarter hair 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.730
 if you are dad I'm fine do not worry about 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.630
 see what party understand that leave me in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.630
 peace a second 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.900
 if aggressions to the guests 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.900
 I missed 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 and although it is taken out as I saw it is not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 the study you want to know how were you 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 I can pass it's not a good idea to enter 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.059
 how this let me go the girlfriend of your 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 dad yes I did tell him he brought homework but 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.050
 she told me something of the history of the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.960
 music I did not understand that I said yes 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.579
 but like she is not very awake not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.859
 let's say she is not very awake 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.230
 I appreciate you worrying about me 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.240
 but this I do not have it well 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.570
 if that's what you need to be a while 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570
 alone 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.890
 and one that what you need to go out to 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.679
 to be here that happens there was a bomb in 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.530
 your closet not only try to order it 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:23.039
 but it remains but it does not matter the things 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.039
 outdoors are better 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.039
 yes 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.799
 and it is the idea of â€‹â€‹the sample to compose a 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.860
 everyone who loves love song 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.600
 impossible I love the idea liam that 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.689
 is father I wrote a song for 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 a ours to sing the continuous and so 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.440
 you realize that it's not you who's the one 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.049
 It makes you feel that way, it's you and your connection 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.539
 with good music I prefer not to talk 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.539
 of that the idea was to leave to clear 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.470
 of those of sat a few bicycles and 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.470
 we go around 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.860
 yes, what happens is that I can not walk 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.860
 seriously bicycle 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.330
