00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.640
 hello everyone I come today 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.039
 in a new video for you waiting 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.510
 bedtime learning for your 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.490
 dog 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.970
 so first of all I use a method 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.779
 that I saw on a facebook status that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.809
 from ben ali dsr i think sanofi like 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.820
 that I'm not sure where al explained 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.500
 how he had learned to lie down to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 his ben ali who is besides 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.790
 beautiful and I admire them it's 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.230
 besides the miss paste 2013 or 2012 I 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.640
 do not know anymore and I was inspired by his 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.719
 method to take it 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.649
 so I got a great deal 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.410
 simplicity 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.230
 strangely to take it to Pegasus because 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.480
 that already Swiss cams elsewhere since 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.710
 always I know only me but we have 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.300
 still tend to grant 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.610
 easily our confidence under the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.130
 eggs and as in addition he loves himself 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.619
 rolling and being that was super easy 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 for us but I know it takes 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.290
 take a lot of time with some 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.020
 horses like I'm trying 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.390
 to take it with fenty I have a lot 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.920
 more harm than with these gases but it's okay 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.549
 come 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.439
 so first of all the first step 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.009
 is that wants that horse agrees to 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.329
 roll close enough to you that he has 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.520
 no need to wait until you are 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.200
 gone to roll it's important 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.820
 it is a beautiful proof of confidence of 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.509
 his share because he is very vulnerable in 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.509
 this position 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020
 Yes 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 then you have to know how to study 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 the way to move from your 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.200
 horse like me I know that these gases i 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 he sniffs the ground and he flexes hard 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.660
 members night falls ill same defect 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.130
 the image case what is it and like that I 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.130
 recognize when he goes to sleep 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.140
 once he was down at the beginning 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.360
 without nikon without anything I observed it and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.680
 emotional and semih I was going to give it 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.640
 a reward for them to understand 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.640
 that this rolled in front of me was good 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.940
 then I put a halter but without 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 lanyard to be able to approach him more 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.690
 easily 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.260
 so I approach I give him the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.860
 carrot 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.709
 I caress him and while giving me 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 rewards I tell him to go to bed 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.830
 bedtime and bedtime it's for kim is 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.080
 bad 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.090
 memories the order I learned everything but 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.570
 circuit tours like that with the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.380
 gas and as and when I said 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.840
 bedtime he started to gather and 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.940
 they are rolling so for example it will be 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.260
 to roll if I tell him to sleep he stops 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.260
 and I will reward them 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.489
 cost 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.200
 then I put a lanyard on him 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.820
 halter and I take him to the abalone market 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.620
 dress I know he likes getting rolled so 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.300
 it seems you must have studied a little 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.420
 little behavior of your horse 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.490
 to be able to fairness and once 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.350
 that I see who are starting to flex a 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.890
 little bit I repeat to him sleeping and lying down 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.200
 and lying down and m when he is 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.880
 lying I read the reward is just 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.780
 like that until he agrees to 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.780
 sleep to order 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.230
 when he is on the ground always the 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.910
 reward as it should be because 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.250
 it is a beautiful proof of confidence and 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.510
 it's very difficult for a horse to 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.970
 give you so much confidence 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.620
 so that's it then you should 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.180
 remind them not to put them 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.950
 in places where they feel 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.230
 vulnerable to teach them this trick 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.750
 because they do not cooperate if 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.550
 some do not have to do at the fall of 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.620
 life for learning because 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.190
 they still have some instincts 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.250
 wild etc. moment there are predators 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.350
 and it's not going their way then me must 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.240
 not do it when it's dark and have 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.470
 led the one place where you know they 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.200
 like to roll often you put a 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.580
 little bit of you all that and especially do not 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.080
 do not lose hope when you 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.060
 learn because I thought that 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.340
 these gases never went to the coast 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.860
 is and would always seek to flee and 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.120
 finally in the space of three weeks 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.320
 he stays by my side while lying down and 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.610
 it's hot in the heart of 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.860
 realize that he gives us as much 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.410
 of trust so I hope this 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.110
 method will work for you I do not 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.020
 not going to talk to you about methods of 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.300
 jean franÃ§ois pinion and all because 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.770
 that I do not know them and I think he 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.320
 it has unleashed youtube videos 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.850
 to explain this method 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.280
 So here I am making you lots of kisses 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.560
 and I hope it worked for 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.330
 you get up very small pictures in 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.810
 comments or on the facebook page 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.810
 kisses
