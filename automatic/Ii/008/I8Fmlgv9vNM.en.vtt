00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
hair leg frizzy it was no good this

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.710 
hair leg frizzy it was no good this
stuff<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:41.019> is<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
stuff this is this is it this is the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.069 
stuff this is this is it this is the
hair<00:02:44.379> cream<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:46.269> that's<00:02:46.540> why<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.810> get<00:02:46.959> this

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
hair cream and that's why you get this

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.110 
hair cream and that's why you get this
massive<00:02:47.590> bottles<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.519> big<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.790> my<00:02:48.909> head

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
massive bottles as big as my head

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.479 
massive bottles as big as my head
because<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.530> takes<00:02:50.739> me<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.040> year<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> go

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
because it takes me one year to go

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.910 
because it takes me one year to go
through<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:53.409> I<00:02:53.769> will<00:02:54.040> go<00:02:54.220> through<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.540> I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
through it and I will go through it so I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.589 
through it and I will go through it so I
probably<00:02:56.920> use<00:02:57.220> about<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.970> quarter<00:02:58.329> size<00:02:58.569> amount

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
probably use about a quarter size amount

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.839 
probably use about a quarter size amount
of<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.409> don't<00:02:59.590> need<00:02:59.739> too<00:02:59.980> much<00:03:00.190> again<00:03:00.579> it

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
of that I don't need too much again it

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.860 
of that I don't need too much again it
will<00:03:01.180> weigh<00:03:01.359> my<00:03:01.540> hair<00:03:01.569> down<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:04.510> this

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
will weigh my hair down and then this

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.979 
will weigh my hair down and then this
