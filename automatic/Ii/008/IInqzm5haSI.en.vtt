00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.150
 Today another opening finally 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.140
 because it was quite a long time ago and 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.730
 for today I have three different ones 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.519
 boosters 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.380
 namely two old fines of heartgold 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.619
 soulsilver series 1 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.470
 andante a striking and one of the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.699
 newest the plasma blast and i have this 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.739
 chosen 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.229
 the janice act artwork because i have 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:28.569
 heard the janice act packets more 

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:31.119
 have bburago but i don't know what 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.490
 below is anyway so it is always 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.110
 a surprise but I thought I'd take the 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.410
 janice act just me and then we watch 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.280
 well i'm going to start from old to 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.920
 new 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.200
 and I'm going to start with Dantes 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.150
 I am not whether germ is from earlier than 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.160
 a band it but i just start with 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.840
 a bath 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.570
 because I almost completely miss that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.060
 just a few prime and the alf 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.579
 little graph 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.470
 so and yes those are pretty hard to 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.640
 will hopefully put it here 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.739
 nicest 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.739
 and have a look 1 2 3 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:11.939
 so 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:11.939
 and we start with a slowbro 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:22.060

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.039

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.200
 is one and combing and my hair is rival 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.209

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.039
 not so that's nice 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.380
 I thought I was one at the 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.030
 had completeness but I still miss this 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.579
 I know I miss a few chances 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.450
 but i thought i was already a fresh one 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.539

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.869
