 Hello in this video I would like to show you very briefly how you like a text 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.800
 in which the browser is simply Rakitic 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.769
 it goes and 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.769
 already said dead 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.169
 No 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.169
 It offers to join him and wait 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.290
 and here you will find a category of thermal beds 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 how they click on Unions is in this moment 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.580
 then someone has to finish the "What we need now is the knee more 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.440
 Title is benefited 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.880
 and this time there is a title for the first time 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.610
 within this category 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.240
 Let's see what it's all about here and declare text ads dead 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.580
 Hong Kong 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.310
 we continue the contracts 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.250
 Preparing text messages and not getting any nicer on the back 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
 a website with a message a shock 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.180
 I sprinkle it down for its piece No, for example, now sits here 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.600
 This text rakes power for their website so they achieve organic goal 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510
 not rare would 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.660
 and what the eu governments see is different 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.180
 the little text 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180

 her text ad lovers account very powerful 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.820
 Israel's somebody down so finding his text is a harder one too 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.940
