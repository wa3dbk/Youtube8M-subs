00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.690 

okay<00:00:05.180> this<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.330> my<00:00:06.480> egg<00:00:06.660> drop<00:00:06.960> project<00:00:07.700> that's

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
okay this is my egg drop project that's

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.930 
okay this is my egg drop project that's
my<00:00:08.880> egg<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:11.929> my<00:00:12.929> idea<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.519> take<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
my egg and my idea was to take a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.540 
my egg and my idea was to take a
triangle<00:00:15.710> like<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.300> one<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:19.550> they

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
triangle like so one right there they

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.000 
triangle like so one right there they
make<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> triangle<00:00:21.119> around<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.420> egg<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.010> then

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
make a triangle around the egg and then

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.550 
make a triangle around the egg and then
make<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> second<00:00:24.300> triangle<00:00:24.720> layer<00:00:25.050> around<00:00:25.260> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
make a second triangle layer around it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.870 
make a second triangle layer around it
because<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.519> egg<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
because as you can see the egg is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
because as you can see the egg is
touching<00:00:27.830> like<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:31.040> bump<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
touching like this little bump in the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.090 
touching like this little bump in the
egg<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.700> set<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> down<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:34.200> touches<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
egg if you set it down it touches and it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.069 
egg if you set it down it touches and it
rotates<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> rolls<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.719> can't<00:00:36.960> have

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
rotates and rolls and you can't have

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.369 
rotates and rolls and you can't have
that<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.510> I'm<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> second<00:00:40.230> layer

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that so I'm going to make a second layer

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.979 
that so I'm going to make a second layer
of<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:41.370> triangle<00:00:41.790> around<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> egg<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.070> then

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
of a triangle around the egg and then

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.240 
of a triangle around the egg and then
you<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.260> two<00:00:46.379> layers<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.649> triangles<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
you have two layers of triangles on the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.950 
you have two layers of triangles on the
egg<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> protect<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
egg to protect it and then I'm going to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
egg to protect it and then I'm going to
put<00:00:51.960> some<00:00:52.199> boxes<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:54.030> box<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.480> from<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
put some boxes that box out from it so I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
put some boxes that box out from it so I
should<00:00:58.079> help<00:00:58.230> protect<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.609> that's<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
should help protect it so that's the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.260 
should help protect it so that's the
basic<00:01:00.149> design<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:04.729> right<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:08.270> drop

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
basic design and this right here is drop

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
basic design and this right here is drop
project

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.210 

yeah<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:48.940> that's<00:01:49.090> pretty<00:01:49.300> much<00:01:49.390> it<00:01:49.980> that's<00:01:50.980> my

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
yeah so that's pretty much it that's my

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.560 
yeah so that's pretty much it that's my
design<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.990> my<00:01:53.080> prototype<00:01:53.650> I<00:01:53.800> got<00:01:53.950> started

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
design to my prototype I got started

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.540 
design to my prototype I got started
looking<00:01:55.570> on<00:01:55.690> at<00:01:55.990> home<00:01:57.450> okay

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
looking on at home okay

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.150 
looking on at home okay
until<00:02:00.550> next<00:02:00.790> time
