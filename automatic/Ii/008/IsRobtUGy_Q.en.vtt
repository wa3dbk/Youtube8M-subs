a<00:03:23.820> little<00:03:24.120> bit<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:24.540> my<00:03:24.690> fingers<00:03:25.080> are<00:03:25.110> really

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
a little bit but my fingers are really

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.850 
a little bit but my fingers are really
cold<00:03:25.560> right<00:03:25.860> now<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:27.000> got<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> bit<00:03:27.420> more

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
cold right now so it's got a bit more

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.130 
cold right now so it's got a bit more
slide<00:03:28.860> than<00:03:29.070> usual<00:03:29.489> but<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.269> usually<00:03:30.660> wear<00:03:31.019> this

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
