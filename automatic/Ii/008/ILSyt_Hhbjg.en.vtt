give<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> same<00:00:42.420> water<00:00:42.690> had<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.590> make

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

elected<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.949> drops<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> then

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
elected all the drops and then

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
elected all the drops and then
discovered<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> each<00:00:48.390> individual<00:00:48.989> leaders

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
discovered that each individual leaders

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.700 
discovered that each individual leaders
different<00:00:49.829> images<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> same<00:00:50.820> water<00:00:51.710> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
different images from the same water you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
different images from the same water you
can<00:00:52.859> see<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> results<00:00:53.640> yes<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
can see the results yes there on the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
easily be reproduced but you would never

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.240 
easily be reproduced but you would never
have<00:01:13.080> thought<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.530> you're<00:01:13.680> also<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.160> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
have thought this you're also on the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
have thought this you're also on the
same<00:01:14.460> water<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.450> compare<00:01:15.870> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
same water because when you compare the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
same water because when you compare the
images<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> different<00:01:16.980> people<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.520> see

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
images from the different people you see

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.170 
images from the different people you see
some<00:01:17.910> big<00:01:18.090> differences<00:01:19.670> then<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.820> undertook

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
some big differences then we undertook

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.000 
some big differences then we undertook
experiments<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.050> find<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.770> things

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
experiments to find out what the things

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.890 
experiments to find out what the things
changed<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.820> put<00:01:24.150> something<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
changed when we put something into the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.310 
changed when we put something into the
water

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
water

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.710

the<00:01:26.310> real<00:01:26.700> flowers<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.450> placed<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> water

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
the real flowers was placed in the water

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
the real flowers was placed in the water
while<00:01:30.720> later<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.200> took<00:01:31.230> a<00:01:31.470> drop<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> water<00:01:32.010> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
while later we took a drop of water and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.960 
while later we took a drop of water and
here<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.120> can<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.480> one<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.870> pictures<00:01:34.970> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
here you can see one of the pictures and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
here you can see one of the pictures and
you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.750> picture<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.890> the

you can see it in this picture it's the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
you can see it in this picture it's the
typical<00:01:38.490> image<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.910> get<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> put<00:01:39.660> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
typical image you get when you put a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.040 
typical image you get when you put a

glass of course that can be reproduced
and<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.340> significant<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.900> were<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> put<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and has significant if you were to put a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.110 
and has significant if you were to put a
different<00:01:49.560> flower<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.160> here<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.610> example<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
different flower in here for example the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.090 
different flower in here for example the
Sweet<00:01:51.360> William<00:01:51.390> flower<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.950> the

Sweet William flower and then all the
drops<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.550> this<00:01:53.700> water<00:01:53.940> would<00:01:54.180> look<00:01:54.360> like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
drops of this water would look like

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.930 
drops of this water would look like
sweet

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.430 

and<00:02:01.940> that<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.330> statement<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.810> water<00:02:03.170> has<00:02:03.410> a

and that the statement that water has a
memory<00:02:03.740> practically<00:02:04.700> changes<00:02:05.180> our<00:02:05.330> whole<00:02:05.570> way

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
memory practically changes our whole way

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.980 
memory practically changes our whole way
of<00:02:05.840> looking<00:02:06.140> at<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> world<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:06.830> course<00:02:07.990> let's

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
of looking at the world of course let's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.420 
of looking at the world of course let's
travel<00:02:09.259> down<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.649> Rhine<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.130> figurative

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
travel down the Rhine in the figurative

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.390 
travel down the Rhine in the figurative
sense<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.990> much<00:02:12.170> water<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.710> flowing<00:02:12.740> down<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
sense so much water is flowing down the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.640 
sense so much water is flowing down the
Rhine<00:02:13.600> sticking<00:02:14.600> up<00:02:14.720> information<00:02:15.350> everywhere

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
Rhine sticking up information everywhere

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.400 
Rhine sticking up information everywhere
it<00:02:15.920> goes<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.690> water<00:02:17.900> has<00:02:18.170> more

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
it goes so the water has more

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.140 
it goes so the water has more
information<00:02:19.070> at<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> mouth<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.880> Rhine

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
information at the mouth of the Rhine

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.800 
information at the mouth of the Rhine
that<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.810> had<00:02:21.050> at<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> source<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.600> Dutch

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that it had at the source and the Dutch

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.930 
that it had at the source and the Dutch
living<00:02:24.470> at<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.680> mouth<00:02:24.860> when<00:02:25.280> they<00:02:25.400> drink<00:02:25.700> that

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
living at the mouth when they drink that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.670 
living at the mouth when they drink that
water<00:02:26.090> they're<00:02:26.450> also<00:02:26.630> drinking<00:02:26.960> all<00:02:27.650> that

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
water they're also drinking all that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.280 
water they're also drinking all that
information

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
information

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.720 
information
thus<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.650> world's<00:02:30.920> oceans<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:31.580> no<00:02:31.700> longer

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
thus the world's oceans would no longer

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.550 
thus the world's oceans would no longer
