00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello everyone and welcome again 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:09.600
 broad agronomy for fifth class this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.170
 is a company produces compost for 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.120
 various uses mainly for the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.650
 conventional agricultural production 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.199
 for now gardening and cabbage fields 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.710
 receive materials from the most diverse 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.369
 to be processed remains of animals or 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 digital agroindustrial waste 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.920
 municipal pruning organic products 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.640
 that fatty papers have been recycled 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.900
 proteins all these materials can 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.870
 be solid and liquid waste 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.680
 the most difficult to deal with are the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.200
 liquid waste from the beginning to 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.760
 the end the elaboration process 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.309
 it lasts about 6 months 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.949
 the process begins with the revision of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.679
 type of core product so that the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.649
 product can be received must 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.290
 have a content analysis because it does not 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.770
 can enter anything and it is also 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.500
 necessary to have the type of product and its 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.409
 analysis to know how to treat it if it is 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 that you need to take it immediately 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.659
 to a life to deal with along with it 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.840
 You can also know if it is a 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.479
 hazardous or non- hazardous waste because 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.940
 the second one is possible to take it to a 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 treatment plant like this one for 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.100
 make compost 2 once the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.549
 product is proceeded with the heavy the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.119
 truck enters a dumbbell where you take the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.920
 initial weight vs. end when and 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.350
 has deposited the product 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.439
 to help a record what they enter 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.600
 and what the company should pay for 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.000
 comes to throw your garbage some 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.780
 materials from which they enter need 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.060
 be processed for example is the case of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.570
 the pruning remains that are cleaned by 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.330
 a threshing machine and this sawdust 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.990
 that are produced serves as the structure of 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.660
 the batteries or trucks 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.450
 for the case of products that come with 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.570
 a very strong pain state are treated 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.120
 as immediate as possible the vast majority 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.020
 of the materials are in another place 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.840
 to be used in the assembly of the battery 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.120
 the assembly process consists of placing 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.470
 a quantity of material suitable for 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.040
 the good nutrition of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.560
 microorganisms and also achieve a good 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.930
 compost but in general terms each 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.330
 pile must have at least one of each 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.060
 waste with which you work 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.460
 daily the size of the pile will go 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.170
 depending on what you look for in it and 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.260
 of the materials used for its 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.660
 conformation for example in the case of 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.750
 the liquid waste is used more batteries 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.080
 high to produce better compost 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.630
 quality lower batteries are used 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.270
 bad smells of the product at the time of 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.680
 Arming are a product of decomposition 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.890
 Initial materials arrive from the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.590
 trucks but as the months go by these 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.480
 odors decrease until you reach a 90 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.930
 percent of less amount of pain 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.720
 after the armed comes the maintenance of 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.420
 the battery in general it turns over every 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.450
 15 days since the oxygen is running out 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.830
 and the temperatures are going up that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.380
 provoke 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.290
 the conditions are not favorable for 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.080
 the development of microorganisms also 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.790
 the batteries are watered at least once 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.460
 per week to maintain humidity 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.400
 relative between 40 to 60 percent 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.370
 flipping a row causes the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.310
 aerobic driving that makes 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.970
 leave co2 alone since not to turn the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.280
 batteries combustion happens to be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.520
 anaerobic called fermentation 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.190
 leaving co2 and methane producing with 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.620
 them bad smells the advantage of the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.490
 aerobic combustion in addition to not 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.160
 produces pain is that it generates a lot of heat 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.250
 temperatures of 60 degrees celsius that 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.320
 Kills the eggs of the flies and also 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.590
 destroy microorganisms that cause 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.520
 harm to the health of man and that helps 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.210
 much personal hygiene and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.240
 customers in addition to the management of this 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.699
 type of batteries is much easier 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.190
 but the disadvantage is that there is a 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.310
 tendency to loss of nutrients be 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.759
 together during the maintenance also 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.979
 does that stack recharge that is to say 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.039
 open the heart of the pile and place 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.949
 new materials and especially products 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.410
 difficult to manage to give 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.120
 food to microorganisms and that 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.180
 can continue the process 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.860
 composting efficiently and for 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.500
 finish well in the process 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.039
 ripening and harvesting the process 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.389
 ripening at the stage where the 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.970
 conditions for these 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.150
 microorganisms that are the majorities of 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.520
 morphy we lower their population and this 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.560
 compost can make concessions after 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.900
 of the aerobic combustion process 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.270
 bacteria die and they start 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.240
 mushrooms appear as you can 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.080
 appreciate at the end you get a product 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.720
 with 90 percent less odor 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.820
 putrefaction compared to 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.550
 matter 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.980
 the compost focused for the farmer 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.350
 It has many specifications 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.020
 physicochemical although you have to have 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.440
 be careful because some companies tend 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.750
 to lie for that in the face of doubt ask for a 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.449
 second opinion before buying a 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.059
 product 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.729
 On the other hand, garden compost is 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.309
 much less informative because the lady 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.680
 of the house he cares that the product 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:02.100
 it only works here you can 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.660
 to appreciate 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.680
 a study that was done with the 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.620
 product and seeing roughly you can 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.050
 build that like all products this 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.630
 it works better if it is used as 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.200
 ground complement as used of 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.200
 training 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.340
 and that we see in the next video 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.340
 see you soon
