and<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.619> thought<00:00:26.770> it<00:00:26.890> was<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.009> great<00:00:27.279> initiative

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
and I thought it was a great initiative

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.370 
and I thought it was a great initiative
and<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.939> great<00:00:28.150> moment<00:00:28.360> also<00:00:28.720> for<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.080> company

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
and a great moment also for the company

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.859 
and a great moment also for the company
to<00:00:29.529> open<00:00:29.920> up<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.160> doors<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.759> for<00:00:31.599> an<00:00:31.660> audience

daily<00:00:35.710> life<00:00:35.739> of<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.309> dancer<00:00:36.460> particularly<00:00:37.300> my

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
daily life of a dancer particularly my

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.009 
daily life of a dancer particularly my
experience<00:00:38.320> myself<00:00:38.769> as<00:00:39.280> an<00:00:39.370> audience<00:00:39.610> member

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
experience myself as an audience member

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.830 
experience myself as an audience member
if<00:00:41.019> you<00:00:41.080> see<00:00:41.559> people<00:00:42.070> on<00:00:42.160> stage<00:00:42.460> they<00:00:43.330> can<00:00:43.360> look

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
if you see people on stage they can look

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.110 
if you see people on stage they can look
almost<00:00:44.110> like<00:00:44.530> untouchable<00:00:45.280> gods<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:45.940> then

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
almost like untouchable gods and then

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.910 
almost like untouchable gods and then
you<00:00:46.330> see<00:00:46.570> them<00:00:46.720> at<00:00:46.930> work<00:00:46.960> in<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.410> studio<00:00:47.680> do

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
you see them at work in the studio do

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.619 
you see them at work in the studio do
you<00:00:47.949> realize<00:00:48.580> they're<00:00:48.760> human<00:00:49.059> beings<00:00:49.089> and

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
you realize they're human beings and

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.860 
you realize they're human beings and
that<00:00:49.720> they<00:00:50.229> eat<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:51.190> they<00:00:51.370> might<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.780> a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
that they eat and that they might have a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.479 
that they eat and that they might have a
bit<00:00:52.989> of<00:00:53.080> hard<00:00:53.229> time<00:00:53.409> staying<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.920> day<00:00:54.100> and

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
bit of hard time staying the day and

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.979 
bit of hard time staying the day and
then<00:00:54.610> they<00:00:54.760> have<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.120> flourishing<00:00:55.540> moment

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
then they have that a flourishing moment

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.780 
then they have that a flourishing moment
in<00:00:56.080> the<00:00:56.170> day<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:56.890> think<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.430> kind<00:00:57.670> of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
in the day so I think that kind of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.750 
in the day so I think that kind of
connection<00:00:58.120> with<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.680> dance<00:01:00.280> life<00:01:00.549> is<00:01:00.729> I

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
connection with the dance life is I

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.399 
connection with the dance life is I
think<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.150> is<00:01:01.239> very<00:01:01.449> valuable<00:01:01.750> if<00:01:02.229> you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
think this is very valuable if you

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.320 
think this is very valuable if you
understand<00:01:02.860> what<00:01:03.190> happened<00:01:03.670> before<00:01:04.000> that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
understand what happened before that

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:16.469 
understand what happened before that
moment<00:01:04.780> gone<00:01:05.140> seeing<00:01:06.070> people<00:01:06.310> on<00:01:06.400> stage<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
moment gone seeing people on stage so

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.149 
moment gone seeing people on stage so
ground<00:01:16.720> technique<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.439> training<00:01:17.860> method

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
ground technique is the training method

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.859 
ground technique is the training method
that<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.369> developed<00:01:18.790> for<00:01:18.820> dancers<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.659> it

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
that I developed for dancers and it

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.990 
that I developed for dancers and it
helps<00:01:20.229> dancers<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:21.010> warm<00:01:21.280> up<00:01:21.460> their<00:01:21.610> bodies

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
helps dancers to warm up their bodies

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.170 
helps dancers to warm up their bodies
really<00:01:22.360> carefully<00:01:22.900> for<00:01:23.200> rehearsal<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.820> also

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
really carefully for rehearsal and also

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.020 
really carefully for rehearsal and also
for<00:01:25.360> performance<00:01:25.960> afterwards<00:01:26.680> so<00:01:27.010> in<00:01:27.940> a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
for performance afterwards so in a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.060 
for performance afterwards so in a
company<00:01:28.540> class<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.990> dancers<00:01:29.320> first<00:01:29.710> start

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
company class the dancers first start

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.670 
company class the dancers first start
working<00:01:30.430> really<00:01:30.790> slow<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.750> then<00:01:31.930> slowly<00:01:32.380> by

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
working really slow and then slowly by

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.160 
working really slow and then slowly by
repetition<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.310> movements<00:01:33.820> go<00:01:34.570> faster<00:01:35.050> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
repetition of movements go faster and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.600 
repetition of movements go faster and
faster<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.620> by<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.740> end<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.070> class<00:01:36.250> they

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
faster and by the end of the class they

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.780 
faster and by the end of the class they
fly<00:01:36.910> all<00:01:37.180> over<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.540> place<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.130> count

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
fly all over the place and count

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.520 
fly all over the place and count
technique<00:01:40.120> works<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> very<00:01:41.200> different

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
technique works with a very different

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.080 
technique works with a very different
principle<00:01:41.950> than<00:01:42.130> old<00:01:42.400> Kentucky<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:42.940> dance

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
principle than old Kentucky and dance

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.580 
principle than old Kentucky and dance
techniques<00:01:43.540> all<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.990> contemporary<00:01:44.440> dance

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
techniques all the contemporary dance

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.350 
techniques all the contemporary dance
techniques<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.070> work<00:01:45.370> with<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.940> notion<00:01:46.330> that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
techniques we work with the notion that

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.570 
techniques we work with the notion that
you<00:01:46.600> keep<00:01:47.080> your<00:01:47.170> control<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:48.190> your<00:01:48.400> body

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
you keep your control in your body

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.700 
you keep your control in your body
through<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.909> center<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.960> income<00:01:50.320> technique

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
through a center and income technique

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.470 
through a center and income technique
will<00:01:50.950> work<00:01:51.159> with<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.610> distribution<00:01:51.970> of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
will work with the distribution of

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.920 
will work with the distribution of
weight<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:53.140> space<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.850> implies<00:01:55.360> always

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
weight in space and that implies always

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.620 
weight in space and that implies always
energy<00:01:56.530> directions<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.340> opposite<00:01:58.120> to<00:01:58.150> energy

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
energy directions and opposite to energy

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.510 
energy directions and opposite to energy
directions<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.860> if<00:01:59.950> my<00:02:00.100> head<00:02:00.280> goes<00:02:00.490> up

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
directions so if my head goes up

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.219 
directions so if my head goes up
actually<00:02:01.060> my<00:02:01.180> feet<00:02:01.420> at<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.630> same<00:02:01.659> time<00:02:02.050> go

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
actually my feet at the same time go

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.230 
actually my feet at the same time go
down<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:02.740> my<00:02:02.920> shoulders<00:02:03.280> go<00:02:03.460> sides<00:02:03.820> both

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
down if my shoulders go sides both

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.510 
down if my shoulders go sides both
shoulders<00:02:04.690> go<00:02:04.870> sides

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
shoulders go sides

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.080 
shoulders go sides
thought

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.910 

what<00:02:14.090> we're<00:02:14.299> doing<00:02:14.599> now<00:02:14.629> is<00:02:15.109> we<00:02:15.319> actually<00:02:15.680> do

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
what we're doing now is we actually do
