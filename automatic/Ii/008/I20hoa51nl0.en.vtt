00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.120

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.370
 country like yours that thousands of years ago 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.240
 the season of good wine 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 It is true that wine is part of 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.530
 French culture and that's why we 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 as a French alliance and as a center 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.040
 cultural 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.210
 we want to share with Nicaraguans 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.360
 that normally good tradition after 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.090
 of the wine harvest should be expected 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.840
 about two three and sometimes thirty years 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.060
 before consuming the wine itself but 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 there is a special wine called the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.759
 donkey you just coming from a 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.009
 French department of the booklet that 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.220
 You can consume the same year of your 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:21.030
 production and well that's a very party 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 popular in France but it is a young wine 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.420
 that does not age right good if you 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 can take in the 34 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 it is the harvest of the year if it is the harvest 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 nouveau from the new wine but also 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.740
 of celebration of the coming harvest 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:54.020
 of very old times because always 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.159
 in Europe and several countries have 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.920

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.960
 supposedly successful production of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.659

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.840

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.350
 bandoneon and last year was the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.000
 managers and this year it will be 80 the 80 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.720

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.720

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.430
 in France it is not the same as 22 of 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.700
 November in Managua at the temperature 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.860
 of this video managua which should be 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.160
 an excellent question in france 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.850
 we always say that 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.720
 Red wine should be taken at 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:41.780
 room temperature is to say around 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:45.440
 of 18 or 19 degrees here for region 27 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.630
 if we have to put the wine on the ice 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.340
 first then because the temperature 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.620
 ideal consumption is 18 19 degrees for 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.660
 white wine - of course and I'll leave 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.180

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.680
 only red wine and for being a wine 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.490
 new then that has not matured much 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.580
 It is a wine that has less alcohol than 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.460
 a wine more more grade then you can 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.350
 drink more there is no consumption limit 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.400
