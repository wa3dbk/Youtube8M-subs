Wow<00:01:17.220> how<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> works<00:01:18.570> you've<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> 12-volt

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
Wow how it works you've got a 12-volt

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
Wow how it works you've got a 12-volt
fan<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> locate<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.850> fan<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> either

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
fan you can locate the fan on either

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.370 
fan you can locate the fan on either
side<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:23.240> whatever's<00:01:24.240> more<00:01:24.450> convenient<00:01:24.840> for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
side here whatever's more convenient for

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
side here whatever's more convenient for
ventilation<00:01:25.890> unless<00:01:26.430> yeah<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.150> looks<00:01:27.330> like

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
ventilation unless yeah that looks like

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.859 
ventilation unless yeah that looks like
visually<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> dozen

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
visually and then there's a dozen

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.010 
visually and then there's a dozen
different<00:01:30.960> ways<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.710> ventilate<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.659> as<00:01:33.659> far<00:01:33.930> as

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
different ways to ventilate it as far as

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.929 
different ways to ventilate it as far as
the<00:01:34.110> outside<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.860> use<00:01:35.040> vents<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the outside you can use vents you can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.819 
the outside you can use vents you can
use<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.420> old<00:01:36.570> holding<00:01:37.020> tank<00:01:37.290> which<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.530> what

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
use the old holding tank which is what

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.400 
use the old holding tank which is what
I've<00:01:37.920> done<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.369> art

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
I've done in my art

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.160 
I've done in my art
you<00:01:40.410> can<00:01:40.590> hook<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.010> solar<00:01:41.280> event<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.170> have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you can hook up a solar event and have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
you can hook up a solar event and have
the<00:01:43.350> fan<00:01:43.620> run<00:01:43.950> through<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.820> VIN<00:01:45.000> itself<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the fan run through the VIN itself and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.020 
the fan run through the VIN itself and
then<00:01:45.870> not<00:01:46.050> have<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.440> hook<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.160> you<00:01:47.880> can

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
then not have to hook up here you can

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.790 
then not have to hook up here you can
hook<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.570> 12<00:01:48.930> volt<00:01:49.170> 110<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.760> so<00:01:51.330> on<00:01:51.800> okay

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
hook this up 12 volt 110 or so on okay

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.330 
hook this up 12 volt 110 or so on okay
so<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:54.180> first<00:01:54.420> question<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:55.170> probably<00:01:55.770> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so the first question you probably get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.050 
so the first question you probably get
is<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.990> reference<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.620> smell<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.700> supposed

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
is in reference to smell it's supposed

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.290 
is in reference to smell it's supposed
