00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.170
 hello that such friends today I will show you 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.939
 a little about how the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.040
 four motorcycle carburetor 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.219
 times let's see some of his 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.890
 external parties and then let's talk a 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.890
 little about how it works 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.970
 well in this part of here below you 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:25.210
 they call Cuba or they are called deposit 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.029
 gasoline has a mechanism that when 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.150
 It is completely filled with a float 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.980
 internal closes the passage of gasoline 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.260
 so that already 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.579
 have keep a level of gas 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.359
 forever 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.149
 this part above is where the needle goes 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.670
 of the carburetor remember that the function 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.429
 of the accelerator is by means of a water already 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.290
 raise the needle to make way for the 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.810
 gasoline and can mix with the air 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.240
 this part of here is the one that goes 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.280
 directly to the engine yes by where already 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.280
 passes our air mixture with air 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.620
 fuel and then I would go directly 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.590
 to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.009
 inside the piston 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.170
 we have this part that is the entrance to 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.170
 air yes with your blind 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.070
 here is the part of each connects to 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 filter the air either be the filter 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.290
 normal or a high flow filter 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.290
 and we have this lever 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.660
 which is known as the crash we're not going 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.150
 to explain a bit how the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.210
 shock this is the normal position of the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.119
 carburetor when it is without shock 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.010
 then there goes directly into the air 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.690
 mixes with the fuel passes 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.210
 direct to the engine 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.280
 when we have problems igniting 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.400
 the motorcycle is said that the motorcycle is due 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.690
 collide then what we do is go up 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.670
 this lever 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.500
 and we see that what she does is that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.630
 completely closes the air passage 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.450
 so that more gas comes in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.760
 engine and achieve greater combustion and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 manages to turn on the motorcycle it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.540
 turn on the motorcycle it must be accelerated 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.760
 the motorcycle and then remove it again 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.970
 of shock so that again in position 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.980
 normal 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.880
 these are emergency cases 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.890
 When the motorcycle is very cold or 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.710
 let 's say it 's freshly washed and a 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.790
 little water to good fuel 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.070
 different factors can not that the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.650
 motorcycle is badly synchronized and has 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.880
 ignition problems have very little 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 different gasoline passage in different 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.420
 reasons why we should use the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.930
 shock then many people 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.819
 they talk about the choking choke 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.940
 the good gas I've heard 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.540
 different 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.610
 different things on the street that you can 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.350
 what they do is confuse the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.930
 people not really what the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.810
 shock is to close the air passage to 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.950
 that enter 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.170
 more gasoline directly to the engine and what 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.849
 we must turn on the motorcycle there 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.360
 that obviously remove the shock to 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.220
 get to ride the motorcycle because what 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.110
 what's going to happen is that he's not going to have a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.819
 very good combustion because all 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.700
 we know that for there to be good 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.620
 combustion air is needed only 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.220
 for the ignition we can never walk 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.760
 with the shock put this hose that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.549
 we see here it's a fire hose 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.280
 its function is when there are too many 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.680
 gases in the carburetor as it is a 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.200
 small exit for what 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.390
 have is like a little escape 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.709
 this entry that we see here is the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.520
 fuel inlet which is 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.070
 directly 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.070
 of the tank the carburetor 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.560
 and we have this screw here which is the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:08.590
 screw 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.900
 let's say drain or is to empty the tank 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.489
 of the carburetor for example when we go 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.340
 to wash the carburetor or when we're going 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.500
 to dismantle it is important to empty it 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.049
 because then we're going to have gas 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.440
 inside and we can spill the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.800
 this screw here screw well 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.159
 important is the pitch screw 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.669
 air in the carburetor adjustment video 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:38.909
 we see how to adjust the air passage 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.490
 and here we can see it much more 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.319
 detailed 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.740
 what I told them to put a 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.740
 marquilla 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.130
 to know how many rounds are given if 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.770
 one and a half turns two turns two 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.610
 turns and a half 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.240
 etc 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.360
 So here we can detail it from 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.770
 best way because many people I 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.129
 they said that he did not look very good 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.800
 screw in the previous view 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.209
 and then I hope they have only 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.429
 some of the future ones that have 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:14.489
 learned a little more about their 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:17.089
 motorcycle and see you in the next 

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:17.089
 video
