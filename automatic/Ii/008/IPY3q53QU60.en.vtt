ugly table with an outlet and shooting
dirty<00:03:39.799> looks<00:03:40.010> at<00:03:40.159> people<00:03:40.280> who<00:03:40.609> have<00:03:40.730> better

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
dirty looks at people who have better

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.399 
dirty looks at people who have better
tables<00:03:41.329> so<00:03:41.510> when<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.659> start<00:03:41.900> writing<00:03:42.109> around

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
tables so when I start writing around

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.610 
tables so when I start writing around
3:00<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.260> probably

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
3:00 and then I have to probably

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.140 
3:00 and then I have to probably
download<00:03:45.950> more<00:03:46.099> music<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.669> get<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:46.939> mood

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
download more music to get in the mood

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.819 
download more music to get in the mood
so<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.659> generally<00:03:47.840> start<00:03:48.109> actually<00:03:48.650> writing

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
so I generally start actually writing

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.490 
so I generally start actually writing
around<00:03:49.159> 11:00<00:03:49.639> p.m.<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:50.299> write<00:03:50.599> all<00:03:50.750> night

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
around 11:00 p.m. and write all night

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.880 
around 11:00 p.m. and write all night
in<00:03:53.280> terms<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.730> writing<00:03:53.940> tips<00:03:54.420> uh<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.350> thought

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
in terms of writing tips uh I thought

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.470 
in terms of writing tips uh I thought
that<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> knew<00:03:56.460> how<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.700> write<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.910> book<00:03:57.090> because

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
that I knew how to write a book because

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.510 
that I knew how to write a book because
I'm<00:03:57.600> also<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.930> book<00:03:58.290> editor<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.130> assumed<00:03:59.430> that

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
I'm also a book editor so I assumed that

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.250 
I'm also a book editor so I assumed that
writing<00:03:59.970> my<00:04:00.120> first<00:04:00.390> book<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.870> hunt<00:04:01.140> room

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
writing my first book the hunt room

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.230 
writing my first book the hunt room
would<00:04:01.350> be<00:04:01.380> really<00:04:01.650> easy<00:04:01.850> it<00:04:02.850> was<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.060> most

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
would be really easy it was the most

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.930 
would be really easy it was the most
difficult<00:04:03.360> thing<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.050> have<00:04:04.500> ever<00:04:04.800> done<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
difficult thing I have ever done but the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.450 
difficult thing I have ever done but the
main<00:04:06.120> thing<00:04:06.360> was<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.470> kept<00:04:07.950> wanting<00:04:08.160> to

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
main thing was that I kept wanting to

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.370 
main thing was that I kept wanting to
stop<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.060> start<00:04:09.270> over<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.750> make<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.960> perfect
