00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.760
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.800
 yes yours 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.680
 in this new video we will see the unboxing 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.330
 of the hyperx genesis a range kit 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.950
 of the kingston's vate performance 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.990
 these rams are the fruit of one 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.240
 collaboration with the online shop at 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.250
 hang stitch you find the link down in 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.310
 description we get caught shortly 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.890
 with the unboxing good guys here we are with 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.030
 the package containing the ram 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.580
 on the upper label we find the 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.739
 mark the latency frequency pattern e 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.900
 other specifications we pass immediately to 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.059
 open the package we put a 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.720
 aside the banks of ram that 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.159
 we will examine shortly put aside 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.930
 the packaging 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.900
 inside we have this little book 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 this leaflet with various 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.760
 illustrations instructions for the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.620
 assembly and various information 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.420
 let's put it aside and here are the ram 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.159
 front and back kill are produces three 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.470
 series of ram those for systems 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.630
 specific ie computers to determine i 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.180
 producing the beautiful you ram ie ram 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.890
 you have these standards for hicks 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.110
 ie high performance 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.390
 heri erix are produced in different 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.090
 series and kits we have dual channel kits 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.160
 like these triple channel quad channel 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.410
 with frequencies to the third and more or less 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.670
 high voltages more or less high e 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.980
 different capacities 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.440
 this particular branch kit is 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.350
 composed of two ddr3 banks of 4 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.600
 gigabyte then a dual channel kit of 8 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.710
 gigabytes belonging to the hyperx series 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.540
 genesis 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.090
 as you can see they have a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.610
 this low profile blue sink 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 here he is, I show him more from 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.870
 close in detail in this way not 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.850
 will prevent the use of heat sinks 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 very large aftermarket 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.330
 the frequency is 1,600 megahertz cl9 a 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.310
 1.65 face with xmp profile activated 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.340
 while if left automatically yes 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.819
 they will therefore comply with the gedeck standard 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.830
 1333 megahertz cl 91.5 times warranty 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.690
 life like all kingston ram in 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.180
 performance terms however changes 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.250
 very little to activate the prof 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.680
 imp you can see very light 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 improvements only by doing benchmarks o 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.629
 in some very dependent application 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.040
 from the ram or if you use the apu amd are gods 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.680
 processors with integrated graphics 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.659
 pretty powerful the topic or otherwise 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.609
 we will face this kit in the future 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.650
 particular came out when the first one was born 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.359
 series of runs to files and ice and good 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.049
 therefore they have the profile voltage 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:46.260
 xmp 1.65 face from sandy bridge onwards 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.969
 the recommended voltage has dropped to 1.5 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.980
 but no problem since as I already have 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.590
 said before thanks to the gedeck standard 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.109
 the ram if we do not activate the xmp profile 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.709
 they will go to standard frequency working 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.750
 at 1333 megahertz and 1.5 volts therefore 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.220
 perfect for sandy ivy bridge e 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.230
 probably for the next ones 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 architectures surely you will stay 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.950
 asking why I chose from iem pc 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.109
 puntoit a ram kit of the first 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.329
 file generation and seven per 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.819
 come with the xmp profile from the voltage 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.069
 out of specification for sandy and ivy bridge is 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.930
 simple nowadays the genesis with 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.909
 xmp profile compatible with new ones 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.579
 architectures are produced from 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.019
 16 gigabytes rather a quantity 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.280
 useless for my needs 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.560
 so I chose the generation 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.169
 previous I could have chosen others 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.090
 copper veil but she genesis as well as of the 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.790
 great ram we talk about kingson after all 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.949
 I like them very aesthetically for the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.060
 blue color and above all for the part 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.220
 silver 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.500
 I don't know if you can see it in relief 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.000
 the standard gedeck then does so 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.400
 make them compatible with architecture 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.709
 that I use what to say therefore of these ram 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.750
 I am certainly very positive 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.430
 the use of low profile heat sinks 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.069
 in this way there will be no problems 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.389
 in the assembly of big the heatsinks 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.370
 aesthetically as mentioned before canceled 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.189
 to say I really appreciate the style of these 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.889
 ram especially as the part already said 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.599
 at least the kit in relief silver 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.680
 apparently it seems to be realized 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.970
 with great care 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.189
 what kings are has us 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.019
 defects used over the years 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.120
 more of the company than the ram is 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.579
 definitely the lack of kit production 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.039
 genesis and for sandy and ivy bridge from 8 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.320
 gigabytes are indeed available as 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.560
 said before starting at 16 gigabytes with 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.969
 native xmp profile to 1.5 face not 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.310
 but everyone can spend a sum 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.090
 rather high we speak of over 100 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.040
 EUR 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.930
 among the 16 gigabytes of ram a 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.150
 quantity that still matters not 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.710
 so many people so really not 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.810
 I understand why not cover the band 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.400
 of 8 gigabytes with genesis 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.470
 certainly there is to say that this band 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.870
 ecofesta from the p empi another series of 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.460
 ram belonging to ai brics but maybe 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.470
 to someone the case with window 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.960
 it would have been better to have the ram 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.180
 blue like these here rather than gray 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.070
 like pmp obviously this is more a 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.210
 aesthetic and performance whim 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.919
 since between the old and new 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.960
 generation to performance are 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.310
 identical but as we all know too 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.050
 the eye wants its part above all 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.510
 when one says a spend figures 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.669
 rather important these copper le 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.620
 found online on alien pc point of life ad 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.389
 a price of around 60 euros 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.160
 thank you once again for the bikes 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.960
 the rams find the site link down in 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.720
 description well the unboxing guys 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.580
 of the kingston hyperx genesis ends 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.500
 here I hope you enjoyed it I hope so 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.539
 been useful I want to remember that on my 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.400
 first channel luigi longo you can find 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.050
 many other video tutorials and tips 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.760
 useful in the IT world 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.740
 while on my second channel 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.479
 gamer of which you can find the link down 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.310
 in description you can find many 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.810
 gameplay commented on by me there 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.120
 I recommend follow me also on twitter 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.380
 i'm youtuber there we peck at a 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.590
 next video
