00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
think most people that run where you say

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.450 
think most people that run where you say
an<00:01:18.330> offensive<00:01:18.869> porygon<00:01:19.229> z<00:01:19.560> most<00:01:20.130> likely<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
an offensive porygon z most likely a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.520 
an offensive porygon z most likely a
running<00:01:20.729> adaptability<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.689> hyper<00:01:21.990> beam<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
running adaptability with hyper beam and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.789 
running adaptability with hyper beam and
try<00:01:23.250> attack<00:01:23.630> could<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.500> that

possibility of the of the I think crunch

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.710 
possibility of the of the I think crunch
has<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.560> side<00:05:45.550> of<00:05:45.580> like<00:05:45.759> that<00:05:45.940> loads<00:05:46.270> of<00:05:46.360> defense

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
waterfall and it was resistant so

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:56.909 
waterfall and it was resistant so
