ice<00:01:02.610> you<00:01:02.640> still<00:01:03.150> have<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.750> standard<00:01:04.170> sonar

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
ice you still have your standard sonar

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219 
ice you still have your standard sonar
which<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.280> nice<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.080> have

which is really nice and then you have
your<00:01:07.380> flasher<00:01:08.570> which<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:09.900> used<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
your flasher which if you're used to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.219 
your flasher which if you're used to
using<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.890> great<00:01:11.840> personally<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
using it's great personally I don't I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.800 
using it's great personally I don't I
don't<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.560> using<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:15.619> these<00:01:16.619> LCD

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
don't like using it with these these LCD

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
don't like using it with these these LCD
displays<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.530> slight<00:01:19.860> lag<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.729> you're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
displays there is a slight lag so you're

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
displays there is a slight lag so you're
not<00:01:21.000> getting<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.320> exact<00:01:22.799> real-time<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
not getting the exact real-time as you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.970 
not getting the exact real-time as you
would<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> flasher<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> mark

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
would with with a flasher like a mark

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.450 
would with with a flasher like a mark
oom<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.900> does<00:01:28.050> work<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.370> really

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
oom but it does work and it is really

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.900 
oom but it does work and it is really
nice<00:01:30.320> at<00:01:31.320> least<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.550> that's<00:01:32.700> what

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
nice at least to have if that's what

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.180 
nice at least to have if that's what
you're<00:01:33.060> used<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:34.490> personally<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.300> prefer

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
you're used to personally I prefer

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.399 
you're used to personally I prefer
what's<00:01:38.190> called<00:01:38.400> split<00:01:38.909> zoom<00:01:39.210> we're<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
what's called split zoom we're on the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.750 
what's called split zoom we're on the
right-hand<00:01:40.860> side<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.550> show<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
right-hand side it's going to show you

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
right-hand side it's going to show you
from<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.720> ice<00:01:42.870> down<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.830> your<00:01:43.950> bottom

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.750 

and<00:01:50.020> then<00:01:50.440> on<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.620> left-hand<00:01:50.920> side<00:01:51.160> it's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
and then on the left-hand side it's

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.550 
and then on the left-hand side it's
going<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.030> show<00:01:52.180> me<00:01:52.210> from<00:01:52.600> 4<00:01:52.900> feet<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
going to show me from 4 feet to the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.910 
going to show me from 4 feet to the
bottom<00:01:53.710> that's<00:01:54.520> about<00:01:54.730> half<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.650> your<00:01:56.650> depth

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
bottom that's about half of your depth

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.120 
bottom that's about half of your depth
is<00:01:57.160> going<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.370> be<00:01:58.290> magnified<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.950> left

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
is going to be magnified on the left

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.460 
is going to be magnified on the left
hand<00:02:00.340> side<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:00.720> if<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.810> get<00:02:02.050> something<00:02:02.410> that

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
hand side so if you get something that

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.719 
hand side so if you get something that
moves<00:02:02.860> in<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:04.180> could<00:02:04.390> possibly<00:02:04.540> be<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.080> fish

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
moves in this could possibly be a fish

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.370 
moves in this could possibly be a fish
it's<00:02:06.729> going<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:06.970> show<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.330> zoomed<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.020> if

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
it's going to show that zoomed in if

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.870 
it's going to show that zoomed in if
there's<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> lot<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.920> clutter<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.459> bottom

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
there's a lot of clutter on the bottom

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.060 
there's a lot of clutter on the bottom
it<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.660> gives<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.990> little<00:02:11.200> magnification

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
it just gives you a little magnification

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.150 
it just gives you a little magnification
to<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:13.380> bb-better<00:02:14.380> decipher<00:02:14.920> what's

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
to the bb-better decipher what's

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.390 
to the bb-better decipher what's
directly<00:02:15.550> underneath<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
directly underneath you so that's the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.010 
directly underneath you so that's the
difference<00:02:18.550> between<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> split<00:02:19.570> zoom<00:02:19.810> and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
difference between the split zoom and

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.530 
difference between the split zoom and
the<00:02:20.080> split<00:02:20.410> flasher<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.070> alors<00:02:21.640> Ansel<00:02:21.940> e7<00:02:22.360> has

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
the split flasher the alors Ansel e7 has

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.320 
the split flasher the alors Ansel e7 has
both<00:02:22.810> those<00:02:23.050> options<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.700> whatever's<00:02:25.060> your

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
both those options so whatever's your

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.520 
both those options so whatever's your
liking<00:02:25.720> yeah<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.930> know<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.350> go<00:02:26.440> ahead

what's<00:02:35.350> down<00:02:35.530> underneath<00:02:35.980> me<00:02:36.250> if<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.970> need<00:02:37.570> to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
what's down underneath me if I need to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.610 
what's down underneath me if I need to
drop<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.830> jig<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> wax<00:02:40.000> worm<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:41.200> finesse

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
drop a jig with a wax worm and finesse

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.710 
drop a jig with a wax worm and finesse
the<00:02:41.800> fish<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.340> been<00:02:42.550> really<00:02:42.790> cold<00:02:43.090> lately

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the fish it's been really cold lately

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.690 
the fish it's been really cold lately
today<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.200> first<00:02:44.470> day<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:45.459> little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
today is the first day of a little

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.030 
today is the first day of a little
warmer<00:02:46.030> weather<00:02:46.209> but<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.500> fishing

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
warmer weather but the the the fishing

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.300 
warmer weather but the the the fishing
has<00:02:48.160> been<00:02:48.340> very<00:02:48.640> scarce<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.720> slow<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:51.280> you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
has been very scarce and slow so you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.270 
has been very scarce and slow so you
might<00:02:51.670> need<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.030> get<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.330> wax<00:02:52.630> worm<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.250> a

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
might need to get a wax worm with with a

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.600 
might need to get a wax worm with with a
jig<00:02:54.549> head<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.209> kind<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.540> finesse<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.049> fish

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
jig head and kind of finesse the fish

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
jig head and kind of finesse the fish
this<00:02:57.610> really<00:02:57.940> helps<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.810> know<00:02:58.930> when<00:02:59.080> you're

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
this really helps you know when you're

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.530 
this really helps you know when you're
doing<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.209> really<00:03:01.330> nice

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
doing that so it's a it's a really nice

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.100 
doing that so it's a it's a really nice
thing<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:03.630> haven't<00:03:04.630> marked<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.930> lot<00:03:05.049> of

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
thing to have I haven't marked a lot of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.810 
thing to have I haven't marked a lot of
fish<00:03:05.350> today<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:05.650> I'm<00:03:05.890> marking<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.370> couple<00:03:06.670> now

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
fish today but I'm marking a couple now

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.310 
fish today but I'm marking a couple now
so<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.120> kind<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.780> show<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.049> what

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
so I just kind of like to show you what

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.610 
so I just kind of like to show you what
that<00:03:08.350> looks<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:10.630> know<00:03:10.660> even<00:03:10.959> mate<00:03:11.140> mate

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.020 

minnows<00:03:14.620> getting<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> couple<00:03:15.310> nibbles<00:03:15.640> but<00:03:15.850> a

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
minnows getting a couple nibbles but a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.130 
minnows getting a couple nibbles but a
lot<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.269> small<00:03:16.660> stuff<00:03:17.100> right<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:20.019> we're

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
lot of small stuff right now but we're

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.360 
lot of small stuff right now but we're
seeing<00:03:20.320> some<00:03:20.500> pretty<00:03:20.620> good<00:03:20.799> color<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.130> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
seeing some pretty good color on the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.090 
seeing some pretty good color on the
screen<00:03:21.700> here<00:03:22.230> that's<00:03:23.230> basically<00:03:23.500> what<00:03:23.980> it's

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
screen here that's basically what it's

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.550 
screen here that's basically what it's
going<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.340> look<00:03:24.400> like<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.600> fish<00:03:26.049> don't<00:03:26.200> appear

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
going to look like the fish don't appear

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.130 
going to look like the fish don't appear
as<00:03:26.650> arches<00:03:27.160> as<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.360> probably<00:03:28.690> have<00:03:28.930> seen

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
as arches as you probably have seen

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.580 
as arches as you probably have seen
before

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
before

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.640 
before
but<00:03:30.160> that's<00:03:30.310> just<00:03:30.430> because<00:03:30.730> we're<00:03:30.910> stationary

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
but that's just because we're stationary

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.900 
but that's just because we're stationary
so<00:03:32.650> they're<00:03:32.799> gonna<00:03:32.890> appear<00:03:33.310> as<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:33.730> these

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
so they're gonna appear as just these

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.530 
so they're gonna appear as just these
these<00:03:34.720> lines<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:36.610> different<00:03:37.150> color

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
these lines and the different color

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.330 
these lines and the different color
palettes<00:03:38.049> can<00:03:38.170> show<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.040> different

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
palettes can show you the different

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.759 
palettes can show you the different
densities<00:03:39.820> which<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:40.959> help<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.260> decipher<00:03:41.739> a

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
densities which can help you decipher a

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.160 
densities which can help you decipher a
larger<00:03:42.280> fish<00:03:42.459> from<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.730> smaller<00:03:43.060> fish<00:03:43.360> like

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
larger fish from a smaller fish like

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.390 
larger fish from a smaller fish like
here<00:03:44.380> we've<00:03:44.560> probably<00:03:44.769> had<00:03:44.980> like<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.250> small

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
here we've probably had like a small

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.710 
here we've probably had like a small
perch<00:03:45.820> coming<00:03:46.209> up<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.420> check<00:03:46.600> out<00:03:46.750> my<00:03:46.900> minnow

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
perch coming up to check out my minnow

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.699 
perch coming up to check out my minnow
yeah<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:49.840> wanted<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.170> show<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.410> what<00:03:50.560> that

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
yeah I just wanted to show you what that

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.400 
yeah I just wanted to show you what that
looks<00:03:50.920> like<00:03:51.100> very<00:03:51.700> clear<00:03:52.180> screen<00:03:52.540> awesome

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
looks like very clear screen awesome

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.610 
looks like very clear screen awesome
colors<00:03:53.769> very<00:03:54.670> bright<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.329> with<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.260> seven

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
colors very bright and with the seven

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.520 
colors very bright and with the seven
inches<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:58.420> know<00:03:58.540> even<00:03:58.900> though<00:03:59.050> I<00:03:59.080> have<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.440> in

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
inches you know even though I have it in

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.369 
inches you know even though I have it in
a<00:03:59.590> split<00:04:00.010> mode<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.489> could<00:04:00.640> have<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:01.540> split<00:04:02.170> motor

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
a split mode I could have a split motor

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.970 
a split mode I could have a split motor
