00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
okay a couple of first impressions the

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.279 
okay a couple of first impressions the
chamber<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.450> doing<00:00:15.599> really<00:00:15.750> well<00:00:15.839> its

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
chamber is doing really well its

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.630 
chamber is doing really well its
handling<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> light<00:00:16.980> really<00:00:17.310> well<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> think

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
handling the light really well I think

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.630 
handling the light really well I think
and<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.630> some<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.680> all<00:00:19.770> things<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.189> good

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and it's some all in all things are good

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.450 
and it's some all in all things are good
however<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.539> ebf<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.050> pretty<00:00:22.320> slow<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:23.400> is

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
however the ebf is pretty slow it is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.269 
however the ebf is pretty slow it is
very<00:00:23.910> difficult<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.510> anticipate<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.800> moment

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
very difficult to anticipate the moment

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.580 
very difficult to anticipate the moment
and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.849> shoot<00:00:27.000> early<00:00:27.390> now<00:00:28.230> every

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and you have to shoot early now every

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
and you have to shoot early now every
camera<00:00:28.890> every<00:00:29.160> DSLR<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.779> this

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
camera every DSLR you have to do this

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.350 
camera every DSLR you have to do this
with<00:00:31.430> you<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> figure<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.120> how

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
with you have to kind of figure out how

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.680 
with you have to kind of figure out how
to<00:00:33.420> tune<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.930> your

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
to tune in your

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.930 
to tune in your
a<00:00:35.719> fingertip<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:37.340> be<00:00:37.460> connected<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:37.850> your

a fingertip to be connected to your

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.279 
a fingertip to be connected to your
brain<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:38.359> such<00:00:38.539> a<00:00:38.570> way<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:38.719> don't<00:00:38.930> that<00:00:39.109> this

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
brain in such a way you don't that this

brain in such a way you don't that this
sort<00:00:39.680> of<00:00:39.739> thoughtless<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:41.120> just<00:00:41.300> shoot<00:00:41.510> when

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
sort of thoughtless to just shoot when

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.740 
sort of thoughtless to just shoot when
the<00:00:42.170> time<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.469> right<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.390> certainly<00:00:44.390> tennis

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
the time is right and certainly tennis

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.139

volleyball<00:00:45.039> these<00:00:46.039> are<00:00:46.190> sports<00:00:46.430> where<00:00:46.760> a

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
volleyball these are sports where a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.540 
volleyball these are sports where a
single<00:00:47.839> frames<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.620> much<00:00:48.860> more<00:00:49.070> important

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
single frames is much more important

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.869 
single frames is much more important
than<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:50.059> motor<00:00:50.659> drive<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.100> I'm<00:00:52.489> having

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
than a motor drive and so I'm having

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.399 
than a motor drive and so I'm having
some<00:00:53.030> difficulty<00:00:53.510> but<00:00:53.719> it's<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.199> something

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
some difficulty but it's it's something

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.500 
some difficulty but it's it's something
I'll<00:00:54.469> pick<00:00:54.680> up<00:00:54.829> I'll<00:00:54.979> learn<00:00:55.129> it<00:00:55.269> but<00:00:56.269> you<00:00:56.390> have

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
I'll pick up I'll learn it but you have

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.969 
I'll pick up I'll learn it but you have
to<00:00:56.600> shoot<00:00:56.719> pretty<00:00:57.019> early<00:00:57.199> much<00:00:57.620> earlier<00:00:57.949> than

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
to shoot pretty early much earlier than

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.209 
to shoot pretty early much earlier than
you<00:00:58.190> would<00:00:58.280> ever<00:00:58.339> have<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.610> do<00:00:58.850> on<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:59.000> DSLR<00:01:00.219> but

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
you would ever have to do on a DSLR but

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.969 
you would ever have to do on a DSLR but
it's<00:01:01.339> not<00:01:01.519> insurmountable<00:01:01.699> for<00:01:02.570> sure<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.649> to

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
it's not insurmountable for sure and to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.850 
it's not insurmountable for sure and to
get<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.309> big<00:01:04.489> file<00:01:04.789> in<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.299> low<00:01:05.690> light<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.500> a

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
get the big file in a low light is a

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.570 
get the big file in a low light is a
pretty<00:01:07.460> good<00:01:07.640> trade-off<00:01:07.850> for<00:01:07.970> right<00:01:08.270> now<00:01:08.300> so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
pretty good trade-off for right now so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.859 
pretty good trade-off for right now so
so<00:01:10.580> far<00:01:10.729> I'm<00:01:10.850> impressed<00:01:10.970> I'm<00:01:11.570> really
