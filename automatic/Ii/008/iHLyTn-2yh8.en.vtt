 all finished number one because 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.599
 they are very easy to apply number two 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.570
 because they are opaque so with a little 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.850

 mate but you do not have a lipstick at hand 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.569
 for any reason use eyeliner for 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.150

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.519
 Also put it under your lipstick to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.370

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.799
