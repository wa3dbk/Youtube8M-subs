you'll get this blank cinema 4d and
you'll<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.620> some<00:00:34.950> two<00:00:35.309> textures<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:36.270> here

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you'll get some two textures down here

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080 
you'll get some two textures down here
now<00:00:37.590> first<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.219> all<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
now first of all we're just going to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.280 
now first of all we're just going to
create<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> basic<00:00:40.350> shape<00:00:40.969> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.110> I

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
create the basic shape of the kind of I

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.520 
create the basic shape of the kind of I
guess<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.739> call<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:43.980> water<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.670> ice<00:00:44.850> effect<00:00:45.530> in

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
guess you call it water or ice effect in

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.279 
guess you call it water or ice effect in
this<00:00:46.890> render<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.579> light<00:00:48.539> room<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.020> really

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
this render the light room is really

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.110 
this render the light room is really
really<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.010> why<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.309> comes<00:00:50.820> out<00:00:50.940> like

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
really good that's why it comes out like

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.520 
really good that's why it comes out like
this<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.379> exactly

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
this so you're not going to get exactly

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
this so you're not going to get exactly
the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.280> effects<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the same effects is what I'm going to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.540 
the same effects is what I'm going to
get<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.410> plane<00:00:55.860> lightroom<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> we're

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
get in a plane lightroom that we're

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.020 
get in a plane lightroom that we're
going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.870> with<00:00:57.870> no<00:00:58.050> lighting<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.649> all<00:00:59.030> but

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
going to use with no lighting at all but

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to use with no lighting at all but
we'll<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> basic<00:01:00.780> shape<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
we'll get the basic shape and then you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
we'll get the basic shape and then you
can<00:01:01.739> use<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> fuel<00:01:02.820> light<00:01:03.059> rooms<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:04.140> put

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
can use that fuel light rooms to put

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.429 
can use that fuel light rooms to put
into<00:01:04.530> text<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.250> things<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> once<00:01:07.260> you've

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
into text and things so once you've

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
into text and things so once you've
opened<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.250> light<00:01:08.580> room<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.000> um<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
opened up this light room that um the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
opened up this light room that um the
download<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> description<00:01:11.010> well<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
going to double click on each arm of the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.789 
going to double click on each arm of the
dots<00:01:49.890> which<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:50.790> make<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:50.970> um<00:01:51.649> invisible<00:01:52.649> in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
dots which will make it um invisible in

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.319 
dots which will make it um invisible in
the<00:01:52.920> render<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> also<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:55.770> view<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:57.299> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the render and also in this view and I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.179 
the render and also in this view and I
just<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.770> bit

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
just want to make this a little bit

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.410 
just want to make this a little bit
smaller<00:01:59.640> say<00:02:00.600> ninety<00:02:01.170> percent<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.490> so

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
smaller say ninety percent about that so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.200 
smaller say ninety percent about that so
it's<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.689> inside<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.920> bits<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.490> still<00:02:05.939> come

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it's just inside so bits can still come

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.479 
it's just inside so bits can still come
out<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.530> shove<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
out now we're going to shove on the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.969 
out now we're going to shove on the
space<00:02:09.000> texture<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.229> that's<00:02:10.379> good<00:02:10.530> space

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
space texture the one that's good space

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.690 
space texture the one that's good space
which<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.000> white<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.450> onto<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.020> bottom

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
which is the white one onto the bottom

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.860 
which is the white one onto the bottom
on<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.330> made<00:02:15.140> first<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:16.720> we're<00:02:17.720> looking

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
on that we made first and we're looking

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.530 
on that we made first and we're looking
good<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:19.459> we're<00:02:19.879> just<00:02:19.910> going<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.239> create<00:02:20.420> a

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
good so now we're just going to create a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.259 
good so now we're just going to create a
cloner<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.170> mograph<00:02:21.680> cloner<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.910> we're<00:02:23.180> just

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
cloner so mograph cloner and we're just

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.020 
cloner so mograph cloner and we're just
going<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.540> create<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.959> basic<00:02:24.230> sphere<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.340> shapes

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
going to create a basic sphere so shapes

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.809 
going to create a basic sphere so shapes
and<00:02:26.769> sphere<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.310> we're<00:02:28.489> going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.640> make<00:02:28.760> this

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
and sphere and we're going to make this

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.229 
and sphere and we're going to make this
pretty<00:02:29.300> small<00:02:29.750> if<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:31.430> go<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.790> if<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.120> click

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
pretty small if you go in if you click

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.780 
pretty small if you go in if you click
sphere<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.900> go<00:02:33.170> into<00:02:33.349> object<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.580> change

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
sphere and go into object just change

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.500 
sphere and go into object just change
this<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.360> go<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:36.319> 1.8<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.300> can<00:02:38.480> see

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
this to go for 1.8 and as you can see

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.120 
this to go for 1.8 and as you can see
that<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:39.050> really<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.560> small<00:02:39.799> we<00:02:40.099> can

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
that is really really small we can

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.119 
that is really really small we can
change<00:02:40.549> that<00:02:41.170> depending<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.319> how<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.650> want<00:02:42.799> it

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
change that depending on how you want it

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.670 
change that depending on how you want it
we<00:02:43.700> can<00:02:43.879> change<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.299> after<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.290> just

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
we can change that after this I just

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.380 
we can change that after this I just
want<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.890> drag<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.340> sphere<00:02:46.730> onto<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> cloner

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
want to drag the sphere onto the cloner

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.979 
want to drag the sphere onto the cloner
and<00:02:47.720> when<00:02:48.500> you're<00:02:48.680> clicked<00:02:49.519> on<00:02:49.700> krona<00:02:49.989> change

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
and when you're clicked on krona change

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.789 
and when you're clicked on krona change
the<00:02:51.200> mode<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:52.209> object<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.480> then<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.709> just

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
the mode to object and then you just

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.039 
the mode to object and then you just
want<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.069> drag<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.970> landscape<00:02:56.510> which<00:02:56.750> we

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
want to drag the landscape which we

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.199 
want to drag the landscape which we
change<00:02:57.410> that's<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.040> red<00:02:58.220> 2<00:02:58.489> which<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> one

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
change that's the red 2 which is the one

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.210 
change that's the red 2 which is the one
that's<00:02:59.360> I'm<00:02:59.599> invisible<00:03:00.049> onto<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.069> object

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
that's I'm invisible onto the object

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.910 
that's I'm invisible onto the object
while<00:03:01.970> you're<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.299> cloner<00:03:02.569> like<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.230> and

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
while you're on the cloner like so and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.039 
while you're on the cloner like so and
you<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.310> want<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.519> go<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:05.150> distribution

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
you just want to go to a distribution

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.240 
you just want to go to a distribution
and<00:03:06.769> change<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.910> volume<00:03:08.799> now<00:03:09.799> as<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.130> can

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
and change this to volume now as you can

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.220 
and change this to volume now as you can
see<00:03:10.310> if<00:03:10.730> we<00:03:10.849> click<00:03:10.970> on<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.239> cloner<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.079> a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
see if we click on the cloner it's a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.160 
see if we click on the cloner it's a
little<00:03:12.620> bit<00:03:12.860> some<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.489> dots<00:03:13.730> inside<00:03:14.269> there<00:03:14.599> now

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
little bit some of dots inside there now

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.319 
little bit some of dots inside there now
i'm<00:03:15.829> in<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.010> mistake<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.670> we<00:03:16.849> should<00:03:16.910> kind<00:03:17.180> of

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
i'm in a mistake here we should kind of

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.900 
i'm in a mistake here we should kind of
up<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:18.049> radius<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.100> not<00:03:19.190> really<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.459> mistake

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
up the radius it's not really a mistake

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.750 
up the radius it's not really a mistake
i<00:03:19.940> guess<00:03:20.269> if<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:21.079> depends<00:03:21.859> on<00:03:22.010> how<00:03:22.730> you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
i guess if you it depends on how you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.530 
i guess if you it depends on how you
want<00:03:22.910> this<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> as<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.739> can<00:03:24.859> see<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.540> color

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
want this so as you can see the color

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.970 
want this so as you can see the color
little<00:03:26.750> balls<00:03:26.959> are<00:03:27.139> in<00:03:27.230> there<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:27.769> just

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
little balls are in there so if we just

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.670 
little balls are in there so if we just
quickly<00:03:28.310> render<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:28.790> out<00:03:29.200> all<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.560> low

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
quickly render this out all of the low

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.800 
quickly render this out all of the low
balls<00:03:30.950> kind<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.370> come<00:03:31.639> through<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.540> if<00:03:32.630> we

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
balls kind of come through and if we

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.330 
balls kind of come through and if we
look<00:03:33.019> back<00:03:33.230> at<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.470> render<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:33.859> can<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.250> all

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
look back at the render you can see all

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.410 
look back at the render you can see all
the<00:03:34.370> Bulls<00:03:34.760> like<00:03:35.000> flying<00:03:35.389> out<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:37.180> kind<00:03:38.180> of

the Bulls like flying out of the kind of

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
space kind of thing the main object now

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.340 
space kind of thing the main object now
it<00:03:43.310> depends<00:03:44.150> how<00:03:44.420> big<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:44.810> want<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.019> make<00:03:45.170> this

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
it depends how big you want to make this

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.530 
it depends how big you want to make this
if<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.709> want<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:46.010> objects<00:03:46.430> actually<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.239> come

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
if you want the objects actually to come

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.140 
if you want the objects actually to come
out<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.959> fly<00:03:48.350> around<00:03:48.380> I'm<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.670> click<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:50.030> the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
out and fly around I'm just click on the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.270 
out and fly around I'm just click on the
landscape<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.989> invisible<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.190> just

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
landscape this invisible and you just

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.530 
landscape this invisible and you just
want<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.579> increase<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.120> size<00:03:53.359> like<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:53.989> and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
want to increase the size like so and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.000 
want to increase the size like so and
you<00:03:56.540> want<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.780> drag<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.260> other<00:03:57.530> material

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
you want to drag the other material

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.900 
you want to drag the other material
which<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.160> Matt<00:04:00.010> 49<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.489> want<00:04:01.639> to<00:04:01.700> drag

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
which is Matt 49 you just want to drag

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.210 
which is Matt 49 you just want to drag
that<00:04:02.060> onto<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.630> sphere<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.290> will<00:04:03.859> render

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
that onto the sphere and will render

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.319 
that onto the sphere and will render
this<00:04:04.340> out<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:06.609> as<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.760> can<00:04:07.880> see<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.150> balls

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
this out and as you can see the balls

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.569 
this out and as you can see the balls
are<00:04:08.420> actually<00:04:08.660> flying<00:04:08.930> out<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.590> now<00:04:10.220> I'm

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
are actually flying out of this now I'm

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.020 
are actually flying out of this now I'm
what<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.090> find<00:04:11.419> best<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.319> I'll<00:04:13.069> definitely<00:04:13.519> use

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
what I find best is I'll definitely use

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.759 
what I find best is I'll definitely use
the<00:04:14.209> space<00:04:14.450> texture<00:04:14.930> onto<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.319> main<00:04:15.500> thing

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
the space texture onto the main thing

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.620 
the space texture onto the main thing
but<00:04:16.190> these<00:04:16.310> little<00:04:16.669> balls<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:17.090> can<00:04:17.329> kinda

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
but these little balls you can kinda

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.140 
but these little balls you can kinda
mess<00:04:17.750> around<00:04:17.900> with<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.349> and<00:04:18.620> on<00:04:19.130> this<00:04:19.700> render

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
mess around with that and on this render

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.140 
mess around with that and on this render
I've<00:04:20.329> actually<00:04:20.510> used<00:04:20.750> kind<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.349> like<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:22.130> mat<00:04:22.849> to

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
I've actually used kind of like a mat to

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.070 
I've actually used kind of like a mat to
to<00:04:23.450> material<00:04:24.349> that<00:04:24.500> has<00:04:25.039> a<00:04:25.070> bit<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.580> reflection

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
to material that has a bit of reflection

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.339 
to material that has a bit of reflection
that<00:04:27.289> adds<00:04:27.470> nice<00:04:27.830> effect<00:04:28.340> I'm<00:04:29.080> also<00:04:30.080> to

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
that adds nice effect I'm also to

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.700 
that adds nice effect I'm also to
improve<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.789> want<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.300> while<00:04:33.110> clicking<00:04:33.379> on

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
improve if you want to while clicking on

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.510 
improve if you want to while clicking on
the<00:04:33.860> cloner<00:04:34.129> if<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.460> go<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.639> McGrath<00:04:35.389> effector

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
the cloner if you go to McGrath effector

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.119 
the cloner if you go to McGrath effector
random<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.020> simply<00:04:39.020> just<00:04:39.259> add<00:04:39.469> in<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.770> random

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
random and simply just add in a random

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.830 
random and simply just add in a random
like<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.610> or<00:04:40.879> you<00:04:41.090> can<00:04:41.240> mess<00:04:41.419> around<00:04:41.449> with

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
like that or you can mess around with

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.330 
like that or you can mess around with
the<00:04:41.960> settings<00:04:42.550> see<00:04:43.550> how<00:04:43.729> you<00:04:43.759> like<00:04:43.909> it<00:04:44.090> and

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the settings see how you like it and

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.770 
the settings see how you like it and
yeah<00:04:46.340> that's<00:04:46.580> really<00:04:47.060> about<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.509> for<00:04:47.689> this

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
yeah that's really about it for this

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.749 
yeah that's really about it for this
tutorial<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.009> can<00:04:49.189> then<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.639> apply

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
tutorial and you can then just apply

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.270 
tutorial and you can then just apply
this<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.389> your<00:04:50.449> text<00:04:51.139> or<00:04:51.349> whatever<00:04:51.949> you<00:04:52.099> want

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
this to your text or whatever you want

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.219 
this to your text or whatever you want
it<00:04:52.400> coming<00:04:52.610> out<00:04:52.849> of<00:04:52.879> and<00:04:53.449> depending<00:04:54.020> on<00:04:54.139> the

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
it coming out of and depending on the

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.719 
it coming out of and depending on the
light<00:04:54.349> room<00:04:54.590> it<00:04:54.740> can<00:04:54.860> add<00:04:55.039> some<00:04:55.219> really<00:04:55.639> really

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
light room it can add some really really

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.390 
light room it can add some really really
nice<00:04:56.000> effects<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:57.740> that's<00:04:57.949> about<00:04:58.069> it<00:04:58.219> for

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
nice effects so that's about it for

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.480 
nice effects so that's about it for
today<00:04:58.610> guys<00:04:58.849> I<00:04:59.330> hope<00:04:59.659> you<00:04:59.840> enjoyed<00:05:00.139> it

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
today guys I hope you enjoyed it

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.529 
today guys I hope you enjoyed it
remember<00:05:01.490> you<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:01.789> you<00:05:02.030> don't<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.389> two

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
remember you can you don't have two

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.080 
remember you can you don't have two
tasks<00:05:02.990> fears<00:05:03.259> in<00:05:03.500> here<00:05:03.650> either<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.280> suppose<00:05:04.909> you

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
tasks fears in here either I suppose you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.379 
tasks fears in here either I suppose you
could<00:05:05.770> switch<00:05:06.770> us<00:05:07.069> to<00:05:07.340> maybe<00:05:07.639> if<00:05:07.909> you<00:05:08.060> want<00:05:08.240> a

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
could switch us to maybe if you want a

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.510 
could switch us to maybe if you want a
capsule<00:05:08.870> in<00:05:08.990> there<00:05:09.199> let's<00:05:09.979> make<00:05:10.159> it<00:05:10.190> bit

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
capsule in there let's make it bit

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.730 
capsule in there let's make it bit
smaller<00:05:10.879> and<00:05:11.240> we'll<00:05:11.509> drop<00:05:11.719> the<00:05:11.780> capsule<00:05:12.440> onto

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
smaller and we'll drop the capsule onto

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.820 
smaller and we'll drop the capsule onto
the<00:05:12.830> cloner<00:05:13.129> like<00:05:13.819> so<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:15.530> want<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.710> make

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
the cloner like so and you want to make

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.689 
the cloner like so and you want to make
sure<00:05:15.860> random<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.759> on<00:05:16.909> this<00:05:17.090> as<00:05:17.300> well<00:05:18.580> but<00:05:19.580> you

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
sure random is on this as well but you

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.269 
sure random is on this as well but you
get<00:05:19.819> the<00:05:19.879> idea<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.650> this<00:05:21.650> could<00:05:21.919> look<00:05:22.069> really

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
get the idea and this could look really

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.170 
get the idea and this could look really
really<00:05:22.580> nice<00:05:23.110> if<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.430> actually<00:05:25.430> spend<00:05:26.029> the

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
really nice if you actually spend the

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.290 
really nice if you actually spend the
effort<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.919> make<00:05:27.919> it<00:05:28.069> look<00:05:28.250> good<00:05:28.279> so<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:29.120> hope

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
effort and make it look good so I hope

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.600 
effort and make it look good so I hope
you<00:05:29.449> enjoyed<00:05:29.689> this<00:05:29.810> guy's<00:05:30.279> back<00:05:31.279> again
