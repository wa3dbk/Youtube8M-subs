they didn't have I haven't figured out
if<00:01:42.270> these<00:01:42.450> were<00:01:42.630> used<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.990> practice<00:01:43.500> or

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
if these were used in practice or

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.060 
if these were used in practice or
anything<00:01:43.759> or<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:46.619> helmet<00:01:46.860> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
anything or what but this helmet is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
anything or what but this helmet is
missing<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.460> few<00:01:47.610> things<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:48.090> normally<00:01:48.810> like

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
missing a few things like normally like

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
missing a few things like normally like
this<00:01:49.259> will<00:01:49.439> say<00:01:49.590> hogs<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.640> just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
this will say hogs up here so I'm just

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.100 
this will say hogs up here so I'm just
guessing<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:51.780> used<00:01:51.960> in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
guessing this was probably used in

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
guessing this was probably used in
practice<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.420> let<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> players

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
practice and they just let the players

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
practice and they just let the players
or<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> mean<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.619> let<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> fans<00:01:56.640> buy

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
or I mean they just let the fans buy

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.929 
or I mean they just let the fans buy
these<00:01:58.070> another<00:01:59.070> thing<00:01:59.369> that's<00:01:59.549> kind<00:01:59.820> of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
these another thing that's kind of

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.660 
these another thing that's kind of
driving<00:02:00.420> me<00:02:00.509> crazy<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.670> metal

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
driving me crazy right now is this metal

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
believe like you know on some of the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.710 
believe like you know on some of the
rebel<00:03:38.160> speeds<00:03:38.459> they<00:03:39.060> actually<00:03:39.300> have<00:03:39.390> like<00:03:39.570> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
rebel speeds they actually have like the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.630 
rebel speeds they actually have like the
black<00:03:39.989> lining<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.709> think<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.070> may<00:03:41.190> look<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.550> get

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
black lining I think I may look to get

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.789 
black lining I think I may look to get
the<00:03:41.790> actual<00:03:42.150> black<00:03:42.570> lining<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.650> tell

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
the actual black lining I can tell

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.590 
the actual black lining I can tell
that's<00:03:43.920> probably<00:03:44.220> been<00:03:44.370> taken<00:03:44.670> out<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.030> from

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
that's probably been taken out and from

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.300 
that's probably been taken out and from
what<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> people<00:03:46.080> told<00:03:46.260> me<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:47.010> bought

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
what the people told me that I bought

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.270 
what the people told me that I bought
this<00:03:47.489> from<00:03:47.700> they<00:03:47.910> did<00:03:48.120> take<00:03:48.390> all<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.959> out

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
this from they did take all that out

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.620 
this from they did take all that out
just<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.430> they<00:03:50.549> could<00:03:50.730> sell<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.420> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
just so they could sell it like that and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.990 
just so they could sell it like that and
I<00:03:51.660> guess<00:03:51.810> they<00:03:51.959> keep<00:03:52.170> their<00:03:52.410> black<00:03:53.100> lines<00:03:53.430> for
