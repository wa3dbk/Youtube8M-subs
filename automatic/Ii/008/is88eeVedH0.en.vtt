00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.110
 sheets of white fabric purchase 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 as you can see on one side of the paper and how 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.220
 spat coupe to make it easier for you 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.860
 attach it on how many loaves 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 light side it goes printed 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.730
 side i put the paper cage up 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.840
 printer loading hole exposing 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.860
 adjust the image to go exactly 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:02.510
 paper put the highest number and 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.510
 press the print button 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.569
 after the image is full 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.440
 print we will need to wait 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.840
 half an hour until the paint is on paper completely 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.570
 sit down so our image now 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.200
 ready and left to wait until she 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.770
 dry in half an hour I can come up and 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.340
 can already be transferred to the fabric 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.340
 first thing i do 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.250
 I turn on the iron on the hottest mode 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.760
 the maximum 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.920
 no function it's time until the iron heats up 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.730
 I will put a special sheet in order 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.350
 so that you can talk on the table 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:11.790
 the sheet is ready now i take the t-shirt 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.970
 put them on the surface ironing should 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.970
 occur on smooth and even 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.970
 surface 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.240
 after we cut we must 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.139
 It will be such a picture and before 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.410
 how to apply it we must determine 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.970
 what place will we glue 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.009
 consider that image on then you 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.410
 printout should be a mirror 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.199
 inverted feature this letter 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.300
 otherwise when we put the image 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.400
 on t-shirt 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.199
 patterned down you can be considered 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.820
 words backwards 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:00.120
 for at least 1 minute we 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.580
 We begin to smooth on the fabric 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:08.849
 images from the middle and 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.849
 smooth for now 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.689
 while the middle of the iron should 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:23.360
 go through each piece of paper with 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.909
 rewind 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.389
 but the iron is needed quite strongly 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:34.020
 press as in the given image in 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:38.150
 the fabric structure itself after you 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.680
 opened for the regiment you need to leave it on 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.639
 5-10 minutes to image 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.639
 got cold 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.770
 you now need accurate and true 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.990
 movement applying effort but at the same time 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.650
 quite often 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.650
 take a picture 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:10.219
 we can you see now what a beauty 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.219
 I eventually got 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.290
 and so now you know how to do 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.870
 such beauty at home but with 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.810
 this is almost nothing to persecute 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.600
 just an hour of your time and 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.100
 T-shirt is ready and ready for your 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.410
 individuality and rip your 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.350
 custom design and such a t-shirt 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.230
 you no longer buy the main thing after that 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.200
 as you will probably do later 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.420
 wash this thing washing should not be 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.450
 more than 30 degrees at this temperature 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.310
 well washed with ordinary powder and 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.270
 at the same time you have saved the drawing 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.700
 long enough that is no time 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.920
