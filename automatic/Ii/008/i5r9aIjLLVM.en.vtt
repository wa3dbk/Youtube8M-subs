00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.300
 Then, in light of what has been done up to now 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.090
 Next time about the pattern with the kiss 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:14.540
 I would like to explain for a moment 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.620
 Well , I will try for a while at No. 8 to 9 for the time being 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.620
 Do about between the light van 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.590
 In you as it becomes about No. 8 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.970
 Hey you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.970
 Even if it says a pattern 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.460
 I hope it got above this English Well Well 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.840
 this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.940
 This line 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.620
 I will run this line, but if I stay here I will wait for points if I get in trouble here 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.809
 In the case of q q It will be different thickness for No. 9 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.809
 In fact 9th of Well want to pocket here 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.410
 Sometimes say 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.070
 Oh dear 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.920
 I 'm going to follow this kind of course from here, especially 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.329
 I hope you'll put out line 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.859
 I will try the difference a little 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.859
 It is those who do not first twisted in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.940
 Minutes 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.080
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.800
 Well course too 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.800
 It was run-out 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.290
 Well, it would be a bit difficult to make an appeal of taking a nine ball 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.290
 I'm doing it again 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.250
 re 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.000
 I wonder if this was a little too much 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.000
 Well it's a little tight to take this course has one more time 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.400
 Hmm 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:03.750
 Even if it is somehow okay with this, by this running distance at all 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.840
 I think the relationship between the position and my goal of a cue ball has been found is that coming very different 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.719
 I will 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.719
 I liked to say know next is a wine of Tteyuu 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.899
 It says I line 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.130
 Pocket and 9 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.270
 I can not enter this course 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.460
 But I guess it's easiest to get in this course 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.480
 It says that a small error which put out line also angularly 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.480
 Let's do it for a moment 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.160
 In that case 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.590
 As I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to eat this kind of course just above 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.460
 Put it in the corn cushion first from here 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.900
 Close to a conspiracy 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.329
 You can use our shop this lower left 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.329
 It is doing but is good even weakened Well 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.310
 par rar 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.880
 By doing so 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:07.490
 I 'm approaching for 9th but it's coming soon 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:10.360
 Even if there is only a book from the power , there is almost no change 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.360
 I'm doing it again 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.010
 Crown of head lower left Re 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.510
 this 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.210
 In this way, 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.300
 But I have one 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.300
 Oh 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.690
 r 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.290
 I think this way, we will towards from Kano cushion once 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.970
 Because 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.840
 If you say the order of magnitude of the order q Even if the force of one train drops 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.620
 Oh dear 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.660
 It is safer not to affect both 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.660
 It is to say that it is more practical
