probed<00:00:08.250> by<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.670> topo<00:00:09.440> specifically<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.590> terms

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
probed by my topo specifically in terms

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.589 
probed by my topo specifically in terms
of<00:00:11.010> hooking<00:00:11.309> up<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:12.150> GPS<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.130> software

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
of hooking up your GPS to the software

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.480 
of hooking up your GPS to the software
I'm<00:00:15.599> using<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:16.020> USB<00:00:16.170> cable<00:00:16.529> I've<00:00:17.010> already<00:00:17.279> put

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
I'm using a USB cable I've already put

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.970 
I'm using a USB cable I've already put
it<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:18.470> remember<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.590> when<00:00:19.710> you're<00:00:19.830> hooked

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it in remember that when you're hooked

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.310 
it in remember that when you're hooked
into<00:00:20.189> your<00:00:20.550> USB<00:00:20.730> cable<00:00:21.240> you're<00:00:21.689> not<00:00:21.869> using<00:00:22.109> the

into your USB cable you're not using the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.599 
into your USB cable you're not using the
battery<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.160> don't<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.460> to

to the top under the GPS menu send to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.960 
to the top under the GPS menu send to
GPS<00:01:27.270> send<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> markers<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
GPS send the markers and this is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
GPS send the markers and this is
standard<00:01:30.390> Windows<00:01:31.670> operating<00:01:33.619> approach<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
standard Windows operating approach so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
standard Windows operating approach so
I'm<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> shift<00:01:35.490> click<00:01:35.750> choose<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.990> four

I'm going to shift click choose all four

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.840 
I'm going to shift click choose all four
but<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.799> control<00:01:38.130> click<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> pick<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
but I could control click to pick the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.569 
but I could control click to pick the
ones<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.180> want<00:01:39.479> or<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.810> them<00:01:39.930> individually

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
ones I want or do them individually

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
ones I want or do them individually
there<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.119> let's<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.960> check<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.200> out

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there now there let's just check it out

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.700 
there now there let's just check it out
to<00:01:43.590> make<00:01:43.619> sure<00:01:43.770> they<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.880> indeed<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:46.340> find

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
to make sure they are indeed here find

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.670 
to make sure they are indeed here find
waypoints<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.630> there<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.649> can

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
waypoints and there they are and we can

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920 
waypoints and there they are and we can
navigate<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.659> I'm<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.869> to

send<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.920> GPS<00:02:10.429> since<00:02:10.640> there's<00:02:10.819> only

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
send it to the GPS since there's only

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.820 
send it to the GPS since there's only
one<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.480> go<00:02:11.690> all<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.870> way<00:02:11.989> down<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.500> bottom

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
one I go all the way down to the bottom

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
one I go all the way down to the bottom
of<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> menus<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.580> route<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:14.000> GPS<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:15.770> done

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
of the menus and route the GPS it's done

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.390 
of the menus and route the GPS it's done
let's<00:02:16.580> check<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:16.940> out<00:02:19.810> menu<00:02:21.760> wraps<00:02:24.250> there<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
let's check it out menu wraps there it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.750 
let's check it out menu wraps there it
is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.600 
is
let's<00:02:26.120> make<00:02:26.330> sure<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.630> looks<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.790> map<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
let's make sure it looks like it map and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.550 
let's make sure it looks like it map and
you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.150> see<00:02:32.360> how<00:02:32.660> zoom<00:02:32.989> in<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> little<00:02:33.349> bit

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
you can see how zoom in a little bit

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.789 
you can see how zoom in a little bit
here<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:35.780> pulled<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:37.340> four<00:02:38.590> waypoints<00:02:39.590> for

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
here it pulled in the four waypoints for

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.949 
here it pulled in the four waypoints for
each<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.220> four<00:02:40.459> corners<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.090> then<00:02:41.780> it

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
each of the four corners and then it

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.490 
each of the four corners and then it
pulled<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:43.030> legs<00:02:44.030> as<00:02:44.269> well<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.200> we'll<00:02:45.350> back

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
pulled in the legs as well so we'll back

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.979 
pulled in the legs as well so we'll back
out<00:02:49.720> back<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.959> satellite<00:02:51.260> page<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:53.750> we'll

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
out back to the satellite page now we'll

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.900 
out back to the satellite page now we'll
do<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.200> track<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:55.549> gosh<00:02:55.819> when<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.720> go<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.989> GPS
