 Well , it is also made under android but 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.080
 put his programs sleep for android 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.520
 it's not worth it 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:37.140
 Determines how to set the phone ear 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.260
 magazine contacts 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.960
 well chosen so nothing 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.550
 for calls incoming and outgoing it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.920

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:27.600

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.230
 dollars right now we'll go to the menu 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.580

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.480

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.459

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.940

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.930
 that you will not see to configure something 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.820

 works trying to turn on writes to us here 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:25.370
 such nonsense, but he is waiting for that 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.370
 nothing comes out of us 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.550

 regular telephone for calls 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.160
