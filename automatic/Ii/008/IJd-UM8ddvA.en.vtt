00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 What's up with kids here ? 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.210
 commenting today I bring notebook a 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.160
 grand theft auto 5 online and this trick 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.010
 is to put us in passive mode when 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.610
 give us a reward worth and so 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.859
 keep the money and even if they kill us 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 they can kill us by appropriating us 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 they will not give you the reward so when 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 spend the time that has to happen to us 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.060
 they will give the money to us good what 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.369
 first we have to do is that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 someone give us a reward is worth and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.059
 As you can see now, I'm going to select 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.950
 turn passive mode and tells me not 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.270
 I can because I have a good reward 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 Well we give star online good to be 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 online options and we place place of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 Garage reappearance is worth it and now we give it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.410
 to look for a new session once that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.820
 let's find the new session we look forward to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 I'll carry this, I'll pass it on 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 camera and good once I load the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.050
 session when we are in our garage 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.180
 the only active ceretÃ© monotype and as 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.250
 I said we will be in passive mode and with 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 the reward once we have 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.909
 post we have put the mod 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.249
 to the players 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 it seems that we have a reward worth 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:13.740
 just the space like that and as I said 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.509
 admit they do not give the reward me 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.250
