00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.210
 my desire in any case to go beyond 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.770
 the simple drum demonstration and 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.720
 to try to make it easy 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.460
 a show around the drums 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.860
 in particular by performance or by 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.150
 humor or by plane 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.129
 at first we started to incorporate 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.019
 just a few gags like that a little 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.659
 shyly and then little by little 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.100
 realized that in the end people 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.690
 that's what they preferred 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.850
 so we left a little bit 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.920
 take it by that and then a few 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 games pass seven years later this is a 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000
 show that still serves the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.289
 battery as a base like point of 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.850
 departure but that is really a lot 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.530
 plus a humorous show 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 an all-public show a show 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 only for debate 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.010
 it 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.360
 all the drummers who come to see us 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.410
 are really happy to see that 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.240
 actually we manage to put the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.560
 battery in the front row and that's it 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.150
 happens to be playful for at least 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.530
 an hour and a quarter we like to say that we 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.120
 is justiciers of the battery a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 small who put the battery back to 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.540
 center 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.640
 then to the people who make the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.580
 performance one stings at the level of 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 drummers at the level of humor in the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.819
 battery good no no to our references of 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.870
 battery since it was our job 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.310
 first in over fifteen years we had the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.989
 luck by before meeting but 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.880
 like like manu katche yvias at 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.070
 show and it was with the gratifying 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.650
 to have to hear some great feedback from 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.030
 his share in humor down here is 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.620
 after that is all and all the cassettes 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.730
 and the DVDs we watched for 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.530
 hours on the road or on my 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.650
 computer while we're doing little 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.540
 not despite kilometers are given 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.370
 poelvoorde françois damiens and like 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.370
 michel courtemanche also good side nîmes 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.970
 in fact a show that uses the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.230
 percussion but ultimately the message 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.890
 it's a lot it's a message that is 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.740
 very that will touch a little everyone 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.600
 just try to get people going 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.070
 finally who love each other what 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.290
 that they love who who hate each other 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.580
 who prick the chopsticks that has 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.790
 really hungry is life what 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.790
 finally
