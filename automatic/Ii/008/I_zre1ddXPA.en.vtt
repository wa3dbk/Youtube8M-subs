relationship<00:00:38.100> they're<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.059> two<00:00:39.210> entwined

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
relationship they're all in two entwined

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.690 
relationship they're all in two entwined
but<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:42.090> makes<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.950> volatile<00:00:43.950> so

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
but it also makes it very volatile so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
but it also makes it very volatile so
it's<00:00:44.969> um<00:00:46.370> it's<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.520> easy<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.110> it's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it's um it's not easy is it it's it's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's um it's not easy is it it's it's
more<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.670> arena<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:53.010> that's<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.520> be

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
more like a an arena and that's can be

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.180 
more like a an arena and that's can be
both<00:00:54.120> entertaining<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
both entertaining but also a lot of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.110 
both entertaining but also a lot of
blood<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:57.090> built<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.969> quite

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
blood is built so I think it's quite

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.070 
blood is built so I think it's quite
intense<00:01:00.590> our<00:01:01.590> relationship<00:01:02.600> another<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.930> if

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
intense our relationship another than if

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.700 
intense our relationship another than if
anyone<00:01:04.500> gives<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.710> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
anyone gives a about that but it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.170 
anyone gives a about that but it's
not<00:01:07.890> always<00:01:08.070> easy<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
not always easy but I think that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.810 
not always easy but I think that
ultimately<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.080> destructive<00:01:11.040> forces<00:01:11.490> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
ultimately the destructive forces that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.859 
ultimately the destructive forces that
are<00:01:13.460> around<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> highly

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
are around are also kind of highly

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.980 
are around are also kind of highly
creative<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:18.060> point<00:01:18.420> where<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
creative that point where you have to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.980 
creative that point where you have to
kind<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.229> step<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.920> arena<00:01:20.189> before<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
kind of step out that arena before it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
kind of step out that arena before it
drags<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.110> under<00:01:22.439> hospice<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> they're

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
drags you under hospice but they're

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
drags you under hospice but they're
ultimately<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.869> very<00:01:25.110> creative<00:01:25.380> places

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
ultimately they are very creative places

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.929 
ultimately they are very creative places
to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.950> find<00:01:29.369> making

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to be in as well but you do find making

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.850 
to be in as well but you do find making
art<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.259> therapy<00:01:31.740> as

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
art is this is it kind of therapy as

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490 
art is this is it kind of therapy as
well<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.729> find<00:01:33.509> we're<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.810> making<00:01:34.229> art

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
well when we find we're not making art

trashed everything and then we throw it
away<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.690> then<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.720> woke<00:02:38.990> up<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> next<00:02:39.350> morning

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
away and then I woke up the next morning

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.300 
away and then I woke up the next morning
and<00:02:40.040> thought<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.820> really<00:02:40.940> good<00:02:41.330> material

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and thought this is really good material

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.510 
and thought this is really good material
because<00:02:43.310> we<00:02:43.490> we<00:02:44.000> use<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> lot<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.630> trash<00:02:45.400> well<00:02:46.400> we

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
because we we use a lot of trash well we

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.880 
because we we use a lot of trash well we
everything<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.330> possible<00:02:47.750> material<00:02:48.410> isn't

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
everything is a possible material isn't

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.080 
everything is a possible material isn't
it<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.410> making<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.620> work<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.860> art<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.790> it

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
it to use in making a work of art so it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.730 
it to use in making a work of art so it
just<00:02:53.180> felt<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.570> waste<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.960> throw<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.200> away<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.440> we

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
just felt a waste to throw it away so we

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.410 
just felt a waste to throw it away so we
bought<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.160> back<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.340> again<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.820> then<00:02:55.970> we

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
bought it back in again and then we

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.760 
bought it back in again and then we
built<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.720> sculpture<00:02:57.080> from<00:02:57.170> it<00:03:02.620> somebody<00:03:03.620> would

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770

happens<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:31.130> circumstances<00:04:32.000> came<00:04:32.270> about

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
happens the circumstances came about

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.379 
happens the circumstances came about
because<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:33.580> time<00:04:34.580> we<00:04:34.699> were<00:04:34.820> working<00:04:35.060> with

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
because a time we were working with

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.719 
because a time we were working with
lights<00:04:36.550> very<00:04:37.550> bright<00:04:37.940> lights<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.479> neon<00:04:38.720> and

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
lights very bright lights and neon and

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.379 
lights very bright lights and neon and
to<00:04:40.729> get<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:42.310> situation<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.849> a<00:04:44.030> kind<00:04:44.330> of

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
to get that situation in a kind of

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.330 
to get that situation in a kind of
working<00:04:44.840> environment<00:04:45.380> which<00:04:45.500> sealed<00:04:45.830> off<00:04:46.070> all

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
working environment which sealed off all

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.740 
working environment which sealed off all
the<00:04:46.520> windows<00:04:46.910> there<00:04:47.210> were<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.300> lot<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.509> big

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
the windows there were a lot of big

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.879 
the windows there were a lot of big
windows<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:50.080> we'd<00:04:51.080> sealed<00:04:51.440> them<00:04:51.680> off<00:04:53.889> so

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
windows and we'd sealed them off so

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.159 
windows and we'd sealed them off so
there's<00:04:55.099> no<00:04:55.220> natural<00:04:55.430> light<00:04:55.940> enough<00:04:56.419> in<00:04:57.020> our

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
there's no natural light enough in our

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.080 
there's no natural light enough in our
working<00:04:57.409> space<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.889> was<00:04:57.979> very<00:04:58.130> dark<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:58.909> any

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
working space it was very dark so any

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.550 
working space it was very dark so any
light<00:04:59.389> created<00:04:59.960> very<00:05:00.199> intense<00:05:00.560> shadows<00:05:01.130> I

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.779 

think<00:05:06.560> that's<00:05:06.740> Paul<00:05:06.979> of<00:05:07.099> these<00:05:07.250> where<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.699> was

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
think that's Paul of these where it was

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.270 
think that's Paul of these where it was
kind<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.060> born<00:05:08.440> there<00:05:09.440> was<00:05:09.560> our<00:05:09.710> shadows<00:05:10.099> being

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
kind of born there was our shadows being

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.129 
kind of born there was our shadows being
projected<00:05:10.580> onto<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.150> walls<00:05:11.389> and<00:05:11.750> we've<00:05:11.900> kind

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
projected onto the walls and we've kind

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.620 
projected onto the walls and we've kind
of<00:05:12.199> just<00:05:12.500> drew<00:05:12.740> around<00:05:13.039> them<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.360> sort<00:05:14.599> of

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
of just drew around them and it sort of

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.029 
of just drew around them and it sort of
happened<00:05:15.409> like<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:16.479> that's<00:05:17.479> good<00:05:17.919> don't<00:05:18.919> win

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
happened like that that's good don't win

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:25.450 
happened like that that's good don't win
I'm<00:05:19.130> off<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:20.720> lose<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:21.229> lose<00:05:23.949> it's<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.099> Orient

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
I'm off you lose I lose it's the Orient

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.970 
I'm off you lose I lose it's the Orient
