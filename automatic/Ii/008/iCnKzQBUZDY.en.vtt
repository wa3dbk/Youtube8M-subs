00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
here I'm going to get a piece of

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.570 
here I'm going to get a piece of
gunpowder<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.770> can<00:02:59.950> turn<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.190> other<00:03:00.400> one

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
gunpowder so I can turn this other one

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.949 
gunpowder so I can turn this other one
into<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.820> splash<00:03:01.060> potion<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:04.870> basically

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
into a splash potion and so basically

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.630 
into a splash potion and so basically
once<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.560> make<00:03:05.770> these<00:03:05.980> things<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.489> pretty

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
once you make these things it's pretty

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.190 
once you make these things it's pretty
much<00:03:06.790> regular<00:03:07.180> poach<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.600> stuff<00:03:07.780> where<00:03:07.989> you

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
much regular poach and stuff where you

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020 
much regular poach and stuff where you
can<00:03:08.350> make<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.739> longer<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.549> make<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.790> I

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
can make it longer you can make it I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.380 
can make it longer you can make it I
think<00:03:10.660> stronger<00:03:11.080> I'm<00:03:11.320> not<00:03:11.500> really<00:03:11.620> sure<00:03:12.390> but

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
think stronger I'm not really sure but

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.130 
think stronger I'm not really sure but
yeah<00:03:14.350> so<00:03:14.709> pretty<00:03:15.010> much<00:03:15.160> that's<00:03:16.090> what<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.780> um

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
yeah so pretty much that's what it is um

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.729 
yeah so pretty much that's what it is um
it's<00:03:18.299> extremely<00:03:19.299> hard<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:20.290> give<00:03:20.440> these<00:03:20.530> two

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
it's extremely hard to give these two

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.740 
it's extremely hard to give these two
