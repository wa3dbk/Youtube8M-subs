00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 know here in at nintendo of europe in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.550
 Frankfurt 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.410
 and yes we are here on an offer from 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.410
 you which is organized sony center 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.379
 Libor is a figurine of that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.600
 nintendo universe what are they 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 main characters I would say and the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 you can play in different 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 use since there are now synonymous 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.149
 a relatively large number of mario left the cat 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 and of course you can, on the one hand 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.780
 to stand in his glass cabinet 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.309
 because they still look pretty 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 but on the other hand they have too 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 damn many functions in the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:08.880
 So if you play the individual 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.590
 then you bought it out and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.819
 can it on the gamepad top left 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.649
 position and then it will be read 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.649
 have to give then you can with the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.140
 fight and it's pretty sour ki the 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.060
 Mexican special moves and tries 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.959
 also to remember this grid and the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.909
 to find gaps 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:26.250
 You can stop it in super smash bros 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.050
 level up and then do some crafts 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.970
 give it better 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.100
 example because here the captain pack the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.800
 is he fast so i can say that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.330
 I train him and he tells me to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.250
 attack more defense have fast 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.410
 is he anyway with you can 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.420
 they fight against them they can up 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.690
 to reach 50 learn to do so 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 sometimes even strategies of pro 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.740
 player 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.970
 you can with your amigo you can like 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.500
 turn them into spring partners 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.120
 you can say well I take a 3ds with 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.560
 come meet us data can interpret 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.000
 already on the way to my example 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 train is already playing you can 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.810
 also outside of course play air without 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.220
 that one says yes we must recognize well 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 now sitting somewhere at home with us 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.009
 You can train it by yourself 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.989
 he just makes him matches first 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.540
 starts with level 1 tooth and can do that 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.480
 Achieve 50 is something totally great 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.480
 which many gamblers approve of 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.329
 There were fights up there where you can with his 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.739
 ebook against other people and their - 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.439
 So fight two against two 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.989
 live with three for eight minutes without 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.459
 items together with his amigo the man 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.000
 He trains the man himself 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.569
 has totally together in the bedroom 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.569
 cool thing 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.670
 in that amigos at the tournament 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.260
 is also a very involved 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.640
 big new factor with arisen on 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.750
 every case so i have mine 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.670
 different things considered I 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.049
 wanted to train the goods were 1 x men 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.360
 start against certain characters or 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.150
 also arrive well on pages 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.549
 And that was definitely right on 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.540
 level really does learn from zero on 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.769
 they play characters 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.720
 For example, they have never been before 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.879
 then it can be fast 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.879
 that they are very destroyed 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.359
 I first have equipment danger with 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.799
 the victory then I'm the lister 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.450
 gone through and saw what 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.400
 Kroepmanns my opinion 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.530
 the strongest was the one I have mine 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.959
 mami given so far and now at 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.549
 My tactics were only on the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.799
 right player to go and the 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.750
 ignore your opponent's offer because 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.620
 I think that I am a player 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.620
 better than all 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.020
 the
