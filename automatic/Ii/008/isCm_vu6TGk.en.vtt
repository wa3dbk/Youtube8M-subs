you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.700> run<00:01:26.850> through<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.119> corner<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you can run through that corner it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
you can run through that corner it's
absolutely<00:01:28.200> incredible<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.710> useful<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
absolutely incredible how useful this is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.120 
absolutely incredible how useful this is
now<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.380> take<00:01:31.380> out<00:01:31.560> enemy<00:01:31.950> air

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
now it can also take out enemy air

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.679 
now it can also take out enemy air
support<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.329> only<00:01:33.509> does<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
support that's right so not only does it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.090 
support that's right so not only does it
take<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:33.990> equipment<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.500> also<00:01:34.650> does<00:01:34.920> air

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
take out equipment it also does air

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890 
take out equipment it also does air
support<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:36.119> need<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> launch<00:01:36.720> on

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
support so you don't need a launch on

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.450 
support so you don't need a launch on
your<00:01:36.930> back<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.350> anything<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.310> can

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's incredible how versatile this thing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.940 
it's incredible how versatile this thing
is<00:02:13.590> now

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
is now

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.699 
is now
the<00:02:14.069> thing<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.120> range<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.870> absolutely

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
the thing is is the range is absolutely

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.620 
the thing is is the range is absolutely
crazy<00:02:16.920> check<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.520> right<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:17.700> Bosch<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
crazy check this out right here Bosch is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.600 
crazy check this out right here Bosch is
halfway<00:02:18.900> across<00:02:19.470> one<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> bigger<00:02:20.190> maps<00:02:20.430> in

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
halfway across one of the bigger maps in

halfway across one of the bigger maps in
the<00:02:20.670> game<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:21.060> can't<00:02:21.599> quite<00:02:21.959> hack<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.500> c4<00:02:22.950> from

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the game I can't quite hack as c4 from

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.800 
the game I can't quite hack as c4 from
right<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.120> inch<00:02:24.330> forward<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
right here but if I inch forward a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.050 
right here but if I inch forward a
couple<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.170> feet<00:02:25.410> boom<00:02:26.099> right<00:02:26.550> there<00:02:26.819> that's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
couple of feet boom right there that's

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
couple of feet boom right there that's
how<00:02:27.360> long<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.750> range<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.410> thing<00:02:28.590> it's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
how long the range is on this thing it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.170 
how long the range is on this thing it's
absolutely<00:02:29.430> incredible<00:02:29.520> there's<00:02:29.849> no<00:02:30.000> way<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
absolutely incredible there's no way you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.580 
absolutely incredible there's no way you
would<00:02:30.300> ever<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.750> hack<00:02:31.050> something<00:02:31.319> from

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
would ever have to hack something from

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.530 
would ever have to hack something from
that<00:02:31.709> far<00:02:31.920> away<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.370> technically<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> range

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that far away so technically the range

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.020 
that far away so technically the range
on<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.840> thing<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.830> limitless<00:02:35.220> now<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.700> one

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
on this thing is is limitless now a one

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
on this thing is is limitless now a one
other<00:02:36.270> strategy<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.020> use<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.560> if

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
other strategy you can use it for is if

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
other strategy you can use it for is if
you<00:02:38.040> put<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> engineer<00:02:38.970> perk<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.420> your<00:02:39.540> third

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you put the engineer perk in your third

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
you put the engineer perk in your third
tier<00:02:39.959> perk<00:02:40.230> slot<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:41.040> way<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.550> see

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
tier perk slot that way you can see

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.850 
tier perk slot that way you can see
enemy<00:02:42.120> equipment<00:02:42.330> through<00:02:42.750> walls<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.349> then

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
enemy equipment through walls and then

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.380 
enemy equipment through walls and then
you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.459> know<00:02:44.519> hack<00:02:44.760> claymores<00:02:45.239> or

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
you can you know hack claymores or

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.640 
you can you know hack claymores or
buddies<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.720> know<00:02:45.810> whatever<00:02:45.959> else<00:02:46.230> through
