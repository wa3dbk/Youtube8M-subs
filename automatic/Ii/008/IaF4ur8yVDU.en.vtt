00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.509
 this one can and I felt 11 but today the show how voice 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.419
 such a match on his island of vista 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.049
 angola certain regions this moment 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.349
 I'm training very very nice so for that you'll open a page 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.179
 internet etc 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.929
 mozilla firefox 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.980
 and you scored precisely and sicce like its big your screen 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.929
 but with a space between the bo and the title 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.279
 you bring in 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.500
 and you go on the first row 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.760
 so if he is tourist osx official site 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 you clicked on it 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.000
 and so the sum you 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.210
 we are on a page 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.920
 on this page if since the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.090
 besides his show 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 on this page so you go from one or two 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 so the next but read here from the other 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.380
 and then of you will have reproduced in meeting this file I doubt that this 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.380
 the man you're going to see trojans who go this file 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.950
 so it's normal 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.730
 32-bit windows vista 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.080
 hope this show 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.120
 it's on a media fayat 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.260
 but of 64-bit vista 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.850
 the only show 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.470
 but what media does yesterday 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 and windows vista 32 bits its union list 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.950
 so to find out if you have a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.040
 at a mixing point small steps in 64 bits on the spectrum at least 32 bits 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.430
 it risks euros 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.460
 so you start 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.670
 on my computer you're going to right click 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 museum to make property 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.050
 and therefore gold on the neck 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.700
 2 if you are on the service pack 1 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.590
 does this mark you on the spectrum if nothing is written if you are on the spot 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.300
 siro 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 so I'm on the spinnaker of 0 because there's nothing shouting at all 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.240
 and after to find out if you're 32-bit or 64-bit 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 we're going to criticize the system 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.220
 and for that a big me I'm 32-bit operating system 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 obviously because I am and what I can say 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.180
 so that if you have a 32 bit on the spectrum or clicked on it 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.449
 the immolation takes us on a media beach done yesterday 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.540
 ellaone no longer dare the titis 6% no it was loading all pulling in 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.869
 the world 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:25.359
 if you are afraid 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.169
 but just his tube beat this show is a story set of 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.629
 channels 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.909
 walnut click read all alone all go from london 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.639
 and if like me you initiated on October 17, 2010 at the age of 10 years or more 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.969
 who kills 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.909
 and there you go haiti who surfs river 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.849
 the presence of NATO in a number of times and 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.329
 you will be able to start small change 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.720
 so here is once again re-created bob swaim so your downloads 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.299
 be in your offices to dedicate Europe 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.099
 so what about things so metals or downloading in this 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.419
 moment added 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.349
 the menu 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.349
 we will see it or and sixt 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.599
 so that's it if you reject sure 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.869
 and after in a clip done on the fight continues to realize 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:22.039
 if you say do what we all explained to continuing care 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.189
 continue to accept 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.529
 we want us it is very very simple 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.519
 so after the day of the dead is this asks you in India 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.620
 according to m at the end of the download will ask you to restart your 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.999
 computer 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.140
 so it's not automatically that we're going to start 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.869
 the title the echo of the tides 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:46.299
 he will want it and then govern jacques tÃ¨ne which will apply to the conti 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.639
 this place 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.899
 and as for the tide times saffron still not I love you like that 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:51.770
 how ol 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.149
 you will always have the theme of vista 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.219
 bm and you will see that you will have noticed a punk icon 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.319
 this one also saw that steel 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.319
 it will be enough to click on it double-click on it 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.969
 you select also existed that I love you 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.109
 you do not pity the foot 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.109
 and that will put this theme to you to submit the 32 10 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.239
 and she says she's happy waiting 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.200
 everything can be learned 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.189
 about five seconds and then it's over 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:22.279
 and you have a super nice theme 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.330
 the club the theme of a match 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.580
 but that sticks pretty well done send you have a dock 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.249
 so after the documents could not 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:33.249
 we install and others do not hover from available on the internet 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.479
 especially 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.479
 outside rocket shells I have not hurt 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.330
 the amount of the post-it basket 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.680
 it takes a RAM type 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.419
 on the original semi walk my dog 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.270
 I think I'll let it follow 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.890
 here we are what you see there the taskbar 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.529
 the baton of a match 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.759
 this man's life 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 after you said the match menus 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.770
 So here is 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.029
 this is a small video to show you 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.639
 how to see such a match 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.360
 flies over his ministry 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.550
 so here's the next video maybe it was 71
