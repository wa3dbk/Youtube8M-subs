see right now it's a why team what I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
see right now it's a why team what I
thought<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.500> pretty<00:00:22.560> neat<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.519> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
thought was pretty neat about it was the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.670 
thought was pretty neat about it was the
fact<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.000> he<00:00:24.180> used<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.050> salmon<00:00:25.500> color

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
fact that he used kind of a salmon color

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.099 
fact that he used kind of a salmon color
ah<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.580> too<00:00:26.789> many<00:00:26.939> theme<00:00:27.240> people<00:00:27.599> use<00:00:27.810> that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
ah not too many theme people use that

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.599 
ah not too many theme people use that
color<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.680> goes<00:00:28.859> real<00:00:29.070> nice<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
color but it goes real nice for the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
color but it goes real nice for the
theme<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.000> think<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> icons<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:31.019> outstanding

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
theme I think the icons are outstanding

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.100 
theme I think the icons are outstanding
I<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.219> he<00:00:32.309> did<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> great<00:00:32.730> job<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> detail

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I think he did a great job in the detail

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
I think he did a great job in the detail
of<00:00:34.380> each<00:00:34.680> icon<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.790> I've<00:00:35.969> been<00:00:36.090> saying
