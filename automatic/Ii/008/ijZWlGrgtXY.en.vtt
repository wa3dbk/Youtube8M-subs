00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.600
 now we receive yajaira 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.910
 the first time on stage I felt 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.920
 nervous because it is a new act that 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.920
 I had never done a very difficult act 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 now what happened to the quarterfinals state 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.050
 several weeks preparing and I come back 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.970
 risk because I want to continue 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.220
 impressing the judges I'm 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 preparing something very little seen and I want 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 get to the semifinal because for me 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.529
 this is all my life and because I have 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.529
 talent a lot of talent 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.860
 ah 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.860
 Y 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.120
 and in sensuality 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.510
 and as I told you last time I'm the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.510
 owner of everything that comes 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.270
 the smallest screw up to 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.020
 to the public 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.020

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.280
 like the head but the welcome one 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.550

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.020
 you go be sincere if I liked it a lot 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.540
 but I would have liked to see a little more 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.640
 of skating that you made in our 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.620
 piston hormones if I would have 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.290
 liked to do more there were complications 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.959
 with the dimensions of the ball court 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.860
 after being a ball I put on a bandana and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.860
 it does not kill you saying it 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.410

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.410

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.099
