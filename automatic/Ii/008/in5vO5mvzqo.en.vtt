00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.430
 good guys 

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.540
 it is often people ask me 'the siege' videocomponent name today is the 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.790
 singer is more or less better than sp 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.789
 and then I comment that the surplus gets better 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.269
 and as organ resolution is low 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.529
 but tevez current is the does not get cool 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.130
 heraclitus testing here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.579
 mine already what I 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.550
 yesterday by a person he bought 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.940
 he wanted it and put it to this composite video 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 o the external component 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.970
 it's a heresy 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
 is one of the first American models 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.310
 we will try 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.720
 it's paul here's the game 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.360
 for you to see this I do not know if it's going to look cool but I think so 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.460
 because the very sharp euro difference 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.050
 is about component video 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.230
 the sp 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.350
 tomato tarr no component video at 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.650
 around here 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.740
 a little land of the other embassy has dried up 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.130
 It's amazing how some people get really big 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 you will notice the cause of danger as well 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.280
 the chains became very defined and ends up leaving everything 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.610
 a little to the picture was assistant 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 thinks spd also asks for a 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 the one that was already avoided 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.580
 the fatal accident is fine 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.109
 Let's see that this side 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.020
 the image is not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.740
 and I right there inside the pants of the suit is not much 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.860
 very defined 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.200
 then it's over 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.690
 not getting so square 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.560
 in component video 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.180
 she does not have the image back either 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.500
 the competitors pd always tries to mess around a lot in the wagon and the 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.169
 of the land 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.499
 everything changed how many are not fools the title 2 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.569
 twists 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.579
 and not yet 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.990
 component video and income 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.990
 it does only for hundreds of coite country 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.829
 in the resolution that he can 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.259
 I already did when I was superintendent 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 what's up 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.539
 same thing as me 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.859
 What do you feel? 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.649
 to mess around a lot 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.649
 because the caption looks beautiful on top of 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.429
 the character 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.609
 deborah in the following 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.049
 with the front facing the 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.719
 hug 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.719
 I will save because of component 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.489
 after you've tagged 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.909
 in your component video it 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:33.769
 when I speak 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.480
 folks 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.629
 long ago 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.459
 be the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.209
 both the characters in the background and especially the triangle right there 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.589
 also for such 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589
 log in 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.629
 the shirt 7 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.629
 try the position 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.439
 there you can see a little better they not so square 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.399
 the component 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.809
 component and mouse ports 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.809
 the voice is there prof 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.729
 ronaldo can see 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.809
 it's very 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.999
 it fits well into the 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.849
 may there be staff have questions 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.840
 it's just an image of my real 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 by component video 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.620
 next time to floors 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 there was no 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.939
 correct 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.020
 among them the middle of the year bush there is a mood 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.319
 proof enough pizza the lightest sea one with a dark 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.430
 We put it on the spot. 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.809
 tomasevic 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:02.809
 This is not a proponent. 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.539
 our friend 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.139
 a little 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.710
 dc which generates a 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.529
 next year 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.259
 so that's why when people ask me 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.279
 What is better 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.059
 I sincerely 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.059
 I recommend the accident 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.960
 most expensive component 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.960
 he had a bit of charm 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.129
 of image 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.409
 on the cd everything worked out the seller gets a 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.409
 no way 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.629
 I think 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.629
 chÃ¢tel practice a notion 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.389
 d as 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.479
 and how is it? 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.389
 This is it, everyone, hugs a park.
