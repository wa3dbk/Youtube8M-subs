00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.320 
years ago and I can't run anymore so
this<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.010> brilliant<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:19.400> me<00:02:19.550> because<00:02:19.970> there's

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
this is brilliant for me because there's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.540 
this is brilliant for me because there's
no<00:02:20.450> needs<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.780> run<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.010> very<00:02:22.310> difficult

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
you start off and you know that this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.580 
you start off and you know that this
game<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:29.030> designed<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.450> get<00:02:29.599> people<00:02:29.959> have

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
game was designed to get people have
