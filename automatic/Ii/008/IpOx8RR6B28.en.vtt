I'm David Stewart I'm an engineering
manager<00:00:11.130> at<00:00:11.820> Intel<00:00:12.240> working<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> open

manager at Intel working in the open
source<00:00:13.530> technology<00:00:14.190> center<00:00:14.490> working<00:00:14.969> very

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
source technology center working very

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.510 
source technology center working very
hard<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.900> make<00:00:15.929> our<00:00:16.320> Intel<00:00:16.770> Xeon<00:00:16.800> processor

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
hard to make our Intel Xeon processor

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.269 
hard to make our Intel Xeon processor
being<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> best<00:00:18.240> choice<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.800> choose<00:00:20.010> open

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
being the best choice if you choose open

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.130 
being the best choice if you choose open
solaris<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> solaris<00:00:21.420> operating<00:00:21.539> system

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
solaris or the solaris operating system

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620 
solaris or the solaris operating system
so<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.130> something<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> i<00:00:24.060> think<00:00:24.359> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so this is something that i think is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
so this is something that i think is
very<00:00:24.720> exciting<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.400> solaris<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:26.820> had

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
very exciting because solaris has had

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.660 
very exciting because solaris has had
this<00:00:27.150> long<00:00:27.480> reputation<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> being<00:00:29.250> very

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this long reputation of being very

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.550 
this long reputation of being very
stable<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.330> actually<00:00:30.660> pretty<00:00:30.929> technically

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
stable and actually pretty technically

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.889 
stable and actually pretty technically
advanced<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.579> very<00:00:32.759> surprised<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
advanced and I was very surprised the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.569 
advanced and I was very surprised the
more<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.200> more<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.380> I've<00:00:34.739> worked<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.219> solaris

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
more and more I I've worked with solaris

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.910 
more and more I I've worked with solaris
how<00:00:35.820> incredibly<00:00:36.480> advances<00:00:37.200> an<00:00:37.500> operating

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
how incredibly advances an operating

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
how incredibly advances an operating
system<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.210> we're<00:00:39.420> coming<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.809> with

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
system and you know we're coming up with

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.240 
system and you know we're coming up with
some<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.230> advanced<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.860> hardware

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
some very advanced to hardware

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
some very advanced to hardware
technologies<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.719> fact<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
technologies to and the fact that it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.190 
technologies to and the fact that it's
open<00:00:43.920> source<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> tremendous<00:00:46.110> because

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
open source really is tremendous because

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.889 
open source really is tremendous because
we<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.850> very<00:00:47.850> much<00:00:47.910> collaborate<00:00:48.719> with

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
we can really very much collaborate with

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
we can really very much collaborate with
a<00:00:48.930> community<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> open<00:00:50.789> really

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a community do it all in the open really

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
a community do it all in the open really
make<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> clear<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.430> know

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
make it clear what it is that you know

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
make it clear what it is that you know
people<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> take<00:00:54.570> advantage<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
people can do to take advantage of this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
people can do to take advantage of this
technology<00:00:55.379> now<00:00:55.770> Intel<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.940> kind<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> go

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
technology now Intel is we kind of go

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.869 
technology now Intel is we kind of go
through<00:00:57.420> our<00:00:57.809> tick-tock<00:00:58.739> sort<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> process<00:00:59.399> of

through our tick-tock sort of process of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.849 
through our tick-tock sort of process of
you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.329> constantly<00:01:00.930> pushing<00:01:01.379> forward<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you know constantly pushing forward the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.229 
you know constantly pushing forward the
envelope<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> terms<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.760> micro<00:01:03.059> architecture

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.859 
envelope in terms of micro architecture
and<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.379> terms<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.710> process<00:01:05.220> technology<00:01:05.869> we're

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and in terms of process technology we're

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.870 
and in terms of process technology we're
kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.010> transition

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
kind of going through that transition

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
kind of going through that transition
today<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.780> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> look<00:01:10.680> forward<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
today as we kind of look forward to the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.719 
today as we kind of look forward to the
future<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.850> our<00:01:11.970> next<00:01:12.330> generation<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
future to our next generation called the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
future to our next generation called the
core<00:01:14.729> microarchitecture<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.049> new<00:01:16.170> core<00:01:16.409> i7

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
core microarchitecture the new core i7

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.499 
core microarchitecture the new core i7
microarchitecture<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> something

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
microarchitecture this is something

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.810 
microarchitecture this is something
we've<00:01:18.630> been<00:01:18.750> calling<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.200> nehalem<00:01:19.770> code<00:01:20.580> name

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
we've been calling the nehalem code name

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.120 
we've been calling the nehalem code name
and<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> lot<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> people<00:01:22.140> still<00:01:22.439> refer<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and so a lot of people still refer to it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
and so a lot of people still refer to it
as<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.450> got<00:01:24.630> an

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
as that but you know it's got an

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
as that but you know it's got an
official<00:01:25.110> name<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.770> try<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.070> use

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
official name so I want to try and use

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.679 
official name so I want to try and use
that<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> show<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> few<00:01:27.630> things

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that I want to show you a few things

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
that I want to show you a few things
that<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.200> specific<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.130> we've<00:01:29.280> done

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that are specific to what we've done

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910 
that are specific to what we've done
with<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:30.119> open<00:01:30.450> solaris<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.020> solaris<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
with with open solaris and solaris to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
with with open solaris and solaris to
really<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.400> sing<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.750> nehalem

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
really make it sing on that that nehalem

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
really make it sing on that that nehalem
processor<00:01:34.579> again<00:01:35.579> we've<00:01:36.270> already<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.810> know

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
processor again we've already you know

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
processor again we've already you know
kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> talked<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.280> processor

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
kind of talked about this a processor

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
kind of talked about this a processor
and<00:01:39.570> said<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.799> something

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and said you know this is something

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
and said you know this is something
which<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> highly<00:01:42.540> scalable<00:01:42.840> architecture

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
which is a highly scalable architecture

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.370 
which is a highly scalable architecture
from<00:01:43.890> two<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> eight<00:01:44.850> cores<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
from two up to eight cores and it's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.560 
from two up to eight cores and it's
showing<00:01:46.770> 4<00:01:47.100> processor<00:01:47.729> cores<00:01:48.030> within<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
showing 4 processor cores within the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.490 
showing 4 processor cores within the
same<00:01:48.780> chip<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> large<00:01:49.920> shared<00:01:50.399> l3<00:01:50.970> cache

same chip with a large shared l3 cache

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
same chip with a large shared l3 cache
and<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.579> integrated<00:01:54.060> memory

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and this is has an integrated memory

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
and this is has an integrated memory
controller<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.290> we've<00:01:55.439> got<00:01:55.590> memory<00:01:56.250> chips

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
controller so we've got memory chips

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.039 
controller so we've got memory chips
that<00:01:56.729> plug<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.479> essentially<00:01:57.840> are

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that plug you know essentially are

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
that plug you know essentially are
connected<00:01:58.469> directly<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.280> plug

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
connected directly to the don't plug

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.039 
connected directly to the don't plug
into<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> robot<00:02:00.060> directly<00:02:00.570> connected<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
into the robot directly connected the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.980 
into the robot directly connected the
processor<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.490> clearly<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.659> very

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
processor and so clearly we have a very

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.330 
processor and so clearly we have a very
interesting<00:02:04.079> architecture<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.250> an

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
interesting architecture this is an

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.240 
interesting architecture this is an
example<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.899> socket<00:02:07.590> system<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.099> we'd

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
example of a to socket system so we'd

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.850 
example of a to socket system so we'd
have<00:02:08.280> two<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.729> our<00:02:08.819> processors<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.860> with

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
have two of our processors here with

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
have two of our processors here with
memory<00:02:11.250> connected<00:02:11.730> etc<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.569> what's

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
memory connected etc and so what's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.760 
memory connected etc and so what's
interesting<00:02:13.230> from<00:02:13.590> an

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
interesting from an

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
interesting from an
opensolaris<00:02:14.130> standpoint<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.900> are

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
opensolaris standpoint is we are

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.600 
opensolaris standpoint is we are
actually<00:02:16.170> doing<00:02:16.500> several<00:02:17.190> interesting

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
actually doing several interesting

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.970 
actually doing several interesting
things<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.180> them<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.990> threads<00:02:19.560> that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
things one of them is the threads that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.530 
things one of them is the threads that
get<00:02:20.190> scheduled<00:02:20.730> by<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.910> operating<00:02:21.420> system

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
get scheduled by the operating system

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.720 
get scheduled by the operating system
right<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:22.590> they're<00:02:22.800> doing<00:02:23.130> things<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.670> of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
right if they're doing things kind of

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.180 
right if they're doing things kind of
naively<00:02:24.420> they<00:02:25.380> won't<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.800> take<00:02:26.040> advantage

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
naively they won't really take advantage

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
naively they won't really take advantage
of<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.610> architecture<00:02:27.150> very<00:02:27.300> well<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.630> turns

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of this architecture very well it turns

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.900 
of this architecture very well it turns
out<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.110> dispatcher<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.950> already<00:02:29.640> pretty

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
out the dispatcher is already pretty

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.900 
out the dispatcher is already pretty
well<00:02:30.830> designed<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.100> adapt<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.880> different

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
well designed to adapt to different

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.300 
well designed to adapt to different
architectures<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:35.010> know<00:02:35.040> really

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
architectures and so you know really

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.950 
architectures and so you know really
just<00:02:35.580> describing<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> dispatcher

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
just describing this to the dispatcher

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.660 
just describing this to the dispatcher
and<00:02:37.170> Solaris<00:02:37.590> or<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:37.950> able<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.400> really

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and Solaris or it's able to really

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.980 
and Solaris or it's able to really
schedule<00:02:39.180> things<00:02:39.360> very<00:02:39.570> well<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.900> this

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
schedule things very well in this

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.140 
schedule things very well in this
architecture<00:02:40.530> also<00:02:41.520> in<00:02:41.640> terms<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:42.000> these

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
architecture also in terms of these

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.790 
architecture also in terms of these
integrated<00:02:42.570> memory<00:02:42.870> controllers<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.650> is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
integrated memory controllers this is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.620 
integrated memory controllers this is
really<00:02:43.980> makes<00:02:44.250> us<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.550> non-uniform<00:02:45.180> memory

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
really makes us a non-uniform memory

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.100 
really makes us a non-uniform memory
architecture<00:02:46.320> or<00:02:46.470> Numa<00:02:46.980> system<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.110> Solaris

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
architecture or Numa system and Solaris

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.630 
architecture or Numa system and Solaris
you<00:02:49.380> know<00:02:49.470> already<00:02:49.770> has<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> technology<00:02:50.460> called

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
you know already has a technology called

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.330 
you know already has a technology called
memory<00:02:51.030> placement<00:02:51.600> optimization<00:02:52.260> or<00:02:52.320> mpo<00:02:52.710> so

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
memory placement optimization or mpo so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.760 
memory placement optimization or mpo so
again<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.270> know<00:02:54.390> by<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.870> describing<00:02:55.410> this

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
again you know by just describing this

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.250 
again you know by just describing this
to<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.190> operating<00:02:56.670> system<00:02:57.090> opensolaris<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
to the operating system opensolaris and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.230 
to the operating system opensolaris and
solaris<00:02:58.680> are<00:02:58.800> able<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.070> take<00:02:59.280> nice<00:02:59.700> advantage

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
solaris are able to take nice advantage

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.850 
solaris are able to take nice advantage
of<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.780> architecture<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.710> is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
of this of this architecture so this is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.920 
of this of this architecture so this is
really<00:03:02.040> cool<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.390> terms<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.690> power

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
really cool and now in terms of power

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.990 
really cool and now in terms of power
I've<00:03:04.230> already<00:03:04.410> kind<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.830> talked<00:03:05.250> about<00:03:05.490> turbo

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
I've already kind of talked about turbo

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.820 
I've already kind of talked about turbo
mode<00:03:06.240> which<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.690> new<00:03:06.930> feature<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.710> this

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
mode which is a new feature in this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.700 
mode which is a new feature in this
processor<00:03:08.340> very<00:03:08.910> interesting<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
processor very interesting and one that

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.870 
processor very interesting and one that
the<00:03:10.830> operating<00:03:11.190> system<00:03:11.490> can<00:03:11.640> take<00:03:11.760> advantage

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
the operating system can take advantage

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.210 
the operating system can take advantage
of<00:03:12.270> but<00:03:12.750> more<00:03:13.140> importantly<00:03:13.710> there<00:03:14.010> are<00:03:14.100> other

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
of but more importantly there are other

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.790 
of but more importantly there are other
advances<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.060> terms<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.960> know<00:03:16.080> really

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
advances in terms of you know really

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.760 
advances in terms of you know really
using<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.520> least<00:03:17.760> power<00:03:18.290> possible<00:03:19.290> when

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
using the least power possible when

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.770 
using the least power possible when
you're<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.040> doing<00:03:20.280> something<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:21.270> having

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
you're not doing something but having

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.630 
you're not doing something but having
the<00:03:21.810> most<00:03:22.140> power<00:03:22.560> available<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.520> when

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
the most power available to you when

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.310 
the most power available to you when
you're<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:24.270> busy<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.750> need<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.990> get<00:03:25.110> stuff

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
you're really busy you need to get stuff

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.290 
you're really busy you need to get stuff
done<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.740> there's<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> project<00:03:26.700> called<00:03:26.850> under

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
done and there's a project called under

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.900 
done and there's a project called under

there's a project called tesla that we

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.790 
there's a project called tesla that we
in<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> community<00:03:32.700> are<00:03:32.820> very<00:03:32.850> involved<00:03:33.390> with

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
in the community are very involved with

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.699 
in the community are very involved with
to<00:03:34.800> optimize<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.400> power<00:03:35.670> area<00:03:36.709> then

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
to optimize this power area then

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.040 
to optimize this power area then
virtualization<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> big<00:03:39.300> advance<00:03:39.690> in<00:03:39.870> terms

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
virtualization is a big advance in terms

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.840 
virtualization is a big advance in terms
of<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.290> processor<00:03:40.740> as<00:03:40.890> well<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.760> we

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
of this processor as well so you know we

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.170 
of this processor as well so you know we
all<00:03:41.910> know<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> lot<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.480> people<00:03:42.840> are<00:03:42.959> using

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
all know a lot of people are using

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.510 
all know a lot of people are using
consolidation<00:03:45.180> using<00:03:45.840> various<00:03:46.290> products<00:03:47.070> and

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
consolidation using various products and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.490 
consolidation using various products and
you<00:03:48.480> know<00:03:48.600> there's<00:03:48.930> there's<00:03:49.110> even<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
you know there's there's even the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.580 
you know there's there's even the
open-source<00:03:50.330> XVM<00:03:51.330> server<00:03:51.720> product<00:03:52.410> that's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
open-source XVM server product that's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.770 
open-source XVM server product that's
that<00:03:52.860> really<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.580> trying<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.480> take<00:03:54.630> advantage

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
that really is trying to take advantage

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.600 
that really is trying to take advantage
of<00:03:55.080> virtualization<00:03:55.740> well<00:03:55.860> we've<00:03:55.980> added<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.370> lot

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
of virtualization well we've added a lot

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.240 
of virtualization well we've added a lot
of<00:03:56.790> features<00:03:57.120> made<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.260> entry<00:03:58.740> and<00:03:58.860> exit<00:03:59.160> into

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
of features made the entry and exit into

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.400 
of features made the entry and exit into
guests<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.880> lot<00:04:00.060> faster<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:00.930> processor

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
guests a lot faster in this processor

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.860 
guests a lot faster in this processor
and<00:04:01.650> we've<00:04:02.220> added<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.730> lot<00:04:02.910> new<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.360> lot<00:04:03.720> of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
and we've added a lot new a lot of

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.440 
and we've added a lot new a lot of
reasons<00:04:04.470> why<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.670> virtualize<00:04:06.090> things<00:04:06.360> so

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
reasons why you can virtualize things so

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.270 
reasons why you can virtualize things so
you<00:04:06.480> don't<00:04:06.690> have<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.050> exit<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.500> guest<00:04:07.740> it's<00:04:08.220> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
you don't have to exit the guest it's a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.340 
you don't have to exit the guest it's a
lot<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.670> advances<00:04:09.180> here<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.600> then<00:04:10.080> finally

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
lot of advances here and then finally

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.640 
lot of advances here and then finally
the<00:04:11.340> new<00:04:11.459> instructions<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.620> counters<00:04:13.620> that

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
the new instructions and counters that

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.229 
the new instructions and counters that
are<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.850> can<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.090> if

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
are in this so that you can really if

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.699 
are in this so that you can really if
you<00:04:15.330> want<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.540> boost<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.080> processing

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
you want to boost the processing

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.310 
you want to boost the processing
performance<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.820> application<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.630> this

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
performance of your application on this

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.289 
performance of your application on this
processor<00:04:19.799> such<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.760> detect

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
processor such that you know you detect

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.300 
processor such that you know you detect
it<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.690> processors<00:04:22.260> there<00:04:22.530> why<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:22.979> can<00:04:23.190> do

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
it that processors there why you can do

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.800 
it that processors there why you can do
they<00:04:23.430> use<00:04:23.729> these<00:04:23.940> new<00:04:24.180> XML<00:04:25.110> instructions<00:04:25.890> and

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
they use these new XML instructions and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.300 
they use these new XML instructions and
really<00:04:27.169> take<00:04:27.350> advantage<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:27.980> in<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
really take advantage of that in the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.850 
really take advantage of that in the
processor<00:04:28.820> as<00:04:28.970> well<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.480> we've<00:04:30.320> got<00:04:30.500> all<00:04:30.710> that

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
processor as well and we've got all that

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.460 
processor as well and we've got all that
support<00:04:31.400> basically<00:04:31.940> in<00:04:32.150> lib<00:04:32.419> CPC<00:04:33.050> which<00:04:33.290> is

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
support basically in lib CPC which is

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.440 
support basically in lib CPC which is
where<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.830> counters<00:04:34.220> are<00:04:34.400> defined<00:04:34.790> new

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
where the counters are defined new

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.330 
where the counters are defined new
instructions<00:04:36.050> support<00:04:36.440> basically<00:04:37.010> in<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
instructions support basically in the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.830 
instructions support basically in the
the<00:04:37.639> whole<00:04:37.820> tool<00:04:38.120> chain<00:04:38.419> that's<00:04:38.600> an<00:04:38.720> open

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
the whole tool chain that's an open

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.400 
the whole tool chain that's an open
solaris<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:41.150> know<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:41.540> how<00:04:41.690> can<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:41.900> you

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
solaris and you know so how can you you

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.020 
solaris and you know so how can you you
get<00:04:42.590> advantage<00:04:42.950> of<00:04:43.130> this<00:04:43.220> how<00:04:43.520> can<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.820> take

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
get advantage of this how can you take

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.610 
get advantage of this how can you take
advantage<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.480> this<00:04:44.600> well<00:04:45.110> what's<00:04:45.350> really

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
advantage of this well what's really

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.200 
advantage of this well what's really
interesting<00:04:45.800> about<00:04:46.040> this<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:47.120> know

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
interesting about this is that you know

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.590 
interesting about this is that you know
in<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.510> new<00:04:47.720> open<00:04:48.169> solaris<00:04:48.669> 2008<00:04:49.669> point<00:04:50.210> 11

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
in the new open solaris 2008 point 11

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.840 
in the new open solaris 2008 point 11
release<00:04:50.960> that's<00:04:51.950> something<00:04:52.370> that<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.610> will

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
release that's something that you will

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.090 
release that's something that you will
really<00:04:53.150> be<00:04:53.240> able<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.510> use<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.740> know<00:04:54.770> when<00:04:54.950> that

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
really be able to use you know when that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.060 
really be able to use you know when that
gets<00:04:55.280> released<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:56.510> be<00:04:56.630> able<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:57.050> see<00:04:57.889> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
gets released to be able to see the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.310 
gets released to be able to see the
source<00:04:58.669> code<00:04:58.910> and<00:04:58.940> have<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.810> know<00:04:59.930> finished

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
source code and have a you know finished

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.590 
source code and have a you know finished
complete<00:05:00.740> distribution<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:02.000> will<00:05:02.180> support

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
complete distribution that will support

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.750 
complete distribution that will support
these<00:05:02.780> processors<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:03.650> that's<00:05:04.550> very

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
these processors and that's very

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.610 
these processors and that's very
exciting<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.389> not<00:05:05.810> only<00:05:05.900> will<00:05:06.080> support<00:05:06.440> them

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
exciting and not only will support them

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.070 
exciting and not only will support them
but<00:05:06.740> will<00:05:06.889> be<00:05:07.010> optimized<00:05:07.520> for<00:05:07.550> them<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:09.050> know

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
but will be optimized for them you know

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.370 
but will be optimized for them you know
we'll<00:05:09.410> also<00:05:09.560> have<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:10.040> solaris<00:05:10.490> 10<00:05:10.610> update

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
we'll also have the solaris 10 update

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.830 
we'll also have the solaris 10 update
that<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.590> coming<00:05:13.190> out<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.430> fall<00:05:13.610> 2008<00:05:14.389> they

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
that is coming out the fall 2008 they

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.650 
that is coming out the fall 2008 they
also<00:05:15.229> is<00:05:16.130> optimized<00:05:16.729> for<00:05:16.760> this<00:05:17.120> processor<00:05:17.510> as

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
also is optimized for this processor as

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.540 
also is optimized for this processor as
well<00:05:17.690> with<00:05:18.050> some<00:05:18.229> of<00:05:18.320> these<00:05:18.380> technologies<00:05:18.770> so

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
well with some of these technologies so

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.219 
well with some of these technologies so
that's<00:05:19.729> pretty<00:05:20.150> cool<00:05:20.240> stuff<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.020> can

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
that's pretty cool stuff you can

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.370 
that's pretty cool stuff you can
actually<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:22.010> know<00:05:22.160> get<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.550> bits<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.389> make

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
actually you know get the bits and make

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.290 
actually you know get the bits and make
use<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.620> them<00:05:24.919> play<00:05:25.160> with<00:05:25.190> them<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.850> processor

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
use of them play with them the processor
