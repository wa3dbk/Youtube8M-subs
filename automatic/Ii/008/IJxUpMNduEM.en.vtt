answer a question in two parts and I'm

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600 
answer a question in two parts and I'm
taking<00:00:37.560> this<00:00:37.680> question<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.430> actually

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
taking this question because I actually

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
taking this question because I actually
got<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> questions<00:00:40.200> similar<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
got a lot of questions similar to this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.790 
got a lot of questions similar to this
I'm<00:00:41.460> reading<00:00:41.700> lots<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.090> questions<00:00:42.540> about<00:00:42.990> what

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I'm reading lots of questions about what

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.640 
I'm reading lots of questions about what
is<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.950> difference<00:00:44.280> between<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> Omni<00:00:46.380> diet

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
is the difference between the Omni diet

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.270 
is the difference between the Omni diet
and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.400> Paleo<00:00:47.670> diet<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.280> similarities

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and the Paleo diet or the similarities

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600 
and the Paleo diet or the similarities
and<00:00:50.490> also<00:00:51.240> raw<00:00:52.020> diets<00:00:52.500> how<00:00:52.950> do<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.220> all<00:00:53.340> fit

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and also raw diets how do they all fit

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
and also raw diets how do they all fit
in<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.450> question<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.080> is<00:00:55.290> a<00:00:55.380> two-part

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
in so the question really is a two-part

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.190 
in so the question really is a two-part
diet<00:00:56.040> because<00:00:56.510> what<00:00:57.510> people<00:00:57.630> are<00:00:57.780> wanting<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
diet because what people are wanting to

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.480 
diet because what people are wanting to
know<00:00:58.320> they're<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:58.890> confused<00:00:59.400> about

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
know they're a little confused about

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.910 
know they're a little confused about
what<00:00:59.640> diets<00:01:00.150> are<00:01:00.270> healthy<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:00.840> aren't<00:01:01.260> where

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what diets are healthy what aren't where

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.609 
what diets are healthy what aren't where
the<00:01:02.100> Omni<00:01:02.400> diet<00:01:02.670> fits<00:01:02.910> into<00:01:03.240> that<00:01:03.390> mix<00:01:03.720> first

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the Omni diet fits into that mix first

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.230 
the Omni diet fits into that mix first
of<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.829> I<00:01:04.859> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> say<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.609> the<00:01:05.700> Omni<00:01:06.030> diet

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
of all I want to say that the Omni diet

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.139 
of all I want to say that the Omni diet
is<00:01:06.509> paleo<00:01:07.200> friendly<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.399> it<00:01:08.490> doesn't<00:01:08.789> compete

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
is paleo friendly so it doesn't compete

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.560 
is paleo friendly so it doesn't compete
with<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.509> Paleo<00:01:10.020> diet<00:01:10.289> at<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.789> I<00:01:11.789> actually

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
with the Paleo diet at all I actually

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.590 
with the Paleo diet at all I actually
consider<00:01:13.109> Loren<00:01:13.439> Cordain<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.829> mentor<00:01:14.249> but<00:01:15.210> what

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
consider Loren Cordain a mentor but what

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
consider Loren Cordain a mentor but what
I<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.749> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.140> say<00:01:16.319> is<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.979> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I do want to say is that it's it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.080 
I do want to say is that it's it's
different<00:01:17.579> in<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> few<00:01:18.359> details<00:01:19.640> what<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.670> Omni

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
different in a few details what the Omni

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
different in a few details what the Omni
diet<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.539> is<00:01:21.749> it's<00:01:21.929> about<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.530> blend<00:01:23.009> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
diet is is it's about the blend it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
diet is is it's about the blend it's
about<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> balance<00:01:24.179> of<00:01:24.710> protein<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
about the balance of protein to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609 
about the balance of protein to
plant-based<00:01:26.549> foods<00:01:26.969> it's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.600> 70<00:01:28.200> %

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
plant-based foods it's a 70 %

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.120 
plant-based foods it's a 70 %
plant-based<00:01:29.189> food<00:01:29.719> diet<00:01:30.719> with<00:01:31.319> 30%

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
plant-based food diet with 30%

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.690 
plant-based food diet with 30%
high-quality<00:01:33.119> protein<00:01:33.569> whereas<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.310> Paleo

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
high-quality protein whereas the Paleo

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.609 
high-quality protein whereas the Paleo
is<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.539> about<00:01:36.659> eating<00:01:37.139> plants<00:01:37.499> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
is really just about eating plants and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.559 
is really just about eating plants and
protein<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.179> there's<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> few<00:01:39.509> other

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
protein and and then there's a few other

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.749 
protein and and then there's a few other
nuances<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:40.889> the<00:01:41.009> Omni<00:01:41.369> diet<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
nuances also the Omni diet is a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.239
