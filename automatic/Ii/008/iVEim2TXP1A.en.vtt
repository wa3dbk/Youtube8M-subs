00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.860
 I had the pleasure of meeting yesterday 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.370
 leonardo rocco here is 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.730
 It is also between 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.660
 specialist who works with many 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.050
 customers 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.990
 they are like movie stars is 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.289
 music and it's work with the products 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.680
 of soft and right now is talking about 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.660
 products that are 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.380
 they have in this keratin product 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.750
 and it's to make your hair look more straight and 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.550
 No, and I'll take away the frizz and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
 then he told me how to use the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.140
 products since I 'm going to share 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.480
 common good first you start with the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.879
 shampoo and the shampoo I like two 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 times the first time is to remove 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.640
 the first time is to remove as everything 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.579
 what remains of the product that you use as 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.859
 what he uses 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.850
 this is removed and then also removed 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.920
 as what causes me like smoke 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.619
 and everything that is in the environment 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.600
 also it helps you to remove and 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.360
 second time 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.430
 the shampoo uses it so that then the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.970
 keratin start working on that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.189
 town and when you shampoo use it from 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.220
 the stripes down or that is washed 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.189
 all the hair and then when that's finished 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.190
 he washes it and uses the conditioner and 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.740
 then it's conditioner is so that 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.350
 ration you get between what and this 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.899
 make it more straight and more scene gets 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.899
 as from here to below it would not make me 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.310
 down because what happens is that your hair 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.520
 already does 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.790
 produces oil and then if you put the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.940
 conditioned is going to be more 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.900
 oil and it's not going to look good because it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.210
 it will be very heavy 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.390
 and then after it is washed with 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.590
 conditioner dries the hair with a 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.840
 towel and then that conditioner is used 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.869
 that stays in the hair and is already the most 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 used as six of a time to say 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.350
 little one they put two brothers and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 it is used from here to down also because 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.540
 do not want to not put if you want 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.300
 will fill you up here with more than 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.510
 600 beautiful from here to down and 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.360
 then when that was just done 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.600
 you can dry your hair with the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.060
 dryer or whatever and this also will 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.160
 is going to help you not burn your hair 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.550
 If you are using as plans 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.440
 well, the dryer, then this 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.750
 Protects it so it does not burn your hair 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.370
 and then after that he will finish 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.959
 do that you can be using the will be 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.300
 then that's just used as two or 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.650
 three drops and it can be more or less 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.480
 It depends 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.659
 that the bow has its hair but like me 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.760
 I have it as well as here the sounders are 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.739
 It can be like two or three drops and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.900
 then that NomÃ¡s also get to 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.299
 down here because he does not want to because 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.370
 they already have it as oil that the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.989
 It helps that the frizz is removed and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.269
 so if it gets up then it's going to 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.510
 be very greasy then the more you put 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.849
 from here side and from the middle to the bottom and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.390
 everything is already there and these products can be 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.859
 do every day but every other day 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.859
 then how is Monday and Tuesday 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.500
 Because after that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.420
 not wanting to get a lot of hair damaged 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.330
 with this at the same time but wash it with 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.550
 ice water and not hot because what 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.370
 happens is that the hot water and then it 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.990
 He dries his hair a lot and then here 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.319
 this product again first is the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.920

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.880
 the conditioned the collider that 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.910
 use then highlights the hair 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.860
 and then the serum and this is used 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.080
 after your hair is dry or 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.000

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.560
