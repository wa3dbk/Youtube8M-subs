below you don't have to jump or anything
the<00:02:14.209> only<00:02:14.420> thing<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.990> make<00:02:15.110> sure

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
the only thing is you have to make sure

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
the only thing is you have to make sure
you<00:02:15.319> take<00:02:15.470> them<00:02:15.590> out<00:02:15.680> quick<00:02:16.010> or<00:02:16.280> else<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:17.120> they

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
you take them out quick or else if they

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.980 
you take them out quick or else if they
pass<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.000> there<00:02:20.330> one<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.630> them<00:02:20.750> went

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
pass that like in there one of them went

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.500 
pass that like in there one of them went
it<00:02:21.530> makes<00:02:21.860> them<00:02:21.980> spawn<00:02:22.280> slower<00:02:22.610> which<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.270> why

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
it makes them spawn slower which is why

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.729 
it makes them spawn slower which is why
i<00:02:23.540> didn't<00:02:23.780> realize<00:02:24.020> one<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.319> past<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.680> you

every minute or two to the right by that

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.930 
every minute or two to the right by that
big<00:02:32.450> gate<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:33.110> go<00:02:33.230> ahead<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.440> kill<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.940> you
