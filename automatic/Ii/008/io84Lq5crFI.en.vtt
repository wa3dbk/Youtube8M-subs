 actors and planters so here is so 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.440
 that you will be great spa the plane earth 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.760
 so there the plant in fact us all 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.910
 just to install it to break 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:35.450
 where you just have to connect a panel 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:39.350
 solar or an energy and then these are the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.780
 masters of dorval plants and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.720
 shoots of the ghosts so a fault the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.500
 trees are in so this plants so 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:58.250
 I do that the plants 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.200
 this is after iron grip and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.819
 diamonds of the strike's death 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.740
 careÃ¯ kettle bordel it serves to increase 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.969
 the terrain so here it is as you can 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.069
 see him learn a lot more everything 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:17.240
 around so here we go to art 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.770
 so beste the adversary what's the point 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.789
 it just serves to cut 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:30.200
 trees were going good since 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.420
 here we are 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.149
 but seeing it is abnormally 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.619
 bar planter when so is the hour 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.560
 of leicester if you put an iron 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.600
 great in the planter 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.409
 it takes absolutely morning in the art 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:52.429
 bester whose lab leicester must be 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.929
 to put in place the planter who 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:59.270
 planters to place themselves in the middle of 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:01.620
 field and hull harvester das principal at 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:09.960
 middle 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:10.530
 and at the end of the line so that's it 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.900
 to cut 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.930
 how to say to have that leaves 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.440
 his leaves there if we want to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.270
 there we have to put there is this so the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.010
 thought for the evening dowry leaves 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.310
 belote bridge engel the taste of 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.650
 weeding a ghetto so that's it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.460
 so it was m 22 30 88 for a small 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.110
 tutorial I think I rather dread about 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.170
 this mode there and on feed the beast 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.890
 entirely for example go when you 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.960
 see all modes 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 I have to do but I'm doing this little 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.740
 studio while waiting for the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.840
 patrick pac method for download 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.090
