00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
moist and you squeeze it in form sort of

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.369 
moist and you squeeze it in form sort of
a<00:02:20.980> ribbon<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.519> if<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.090> extends<00:02:22.629> out<00:02:22.750> beyond<00:02:23.140> an

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
a ribbon and if it extends out beyond an

a ribbon and if it extends out beyond an
inch<00:02:23.560> or<00:02:23.709> two<00:02:23.920> then<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.760> probably<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.540> lot

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
inch or two then you probably have a lot

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.190 
inch or two then you probably have a lot
of<00:02:25.810> clay<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.140> your<00:02:26.349> soil<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:28.120> doesn't<00:02:28.629> form

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
very far and it breaks off you probably

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.350 
very far and it breaks off you probably
have<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.599> lot<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.900> sand<00:02:32.079> in<00:02:32.319> your<00:02:32.440> soil<00:02:33.360> most

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
have a lot of sand in your soil most

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.750 
have a lot of sand in your soil most
gardeners<00:02:35.019> should<00:02:35.319> consider<00:02:35.769> giving<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.430> soil

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
sampling tube of some kind because you

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.809 
sampling tube of some kind because you

hold the soil really nicely together we

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.539 
hold the soil really nicely together we

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
the nematodes the fungi this is what is

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.289 
the nematodes the fungi this is what is
sort<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.099> the<00:03:42.220> party<00:03:42.579> in<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.819> soil<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.239> you

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
sort of the party in the soil and you

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.000 
sort of the party in the soil and you
want<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.599> keep<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.900> party<00:03:44.230> going<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.769> means

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
want to keep that party going it means

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.339 
want to keep that party going it means
less<00:03:45.250> work<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.849> because<00:03:46.599> it's<00:03:46.959> helping

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
less work for you because it's helping

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.530 
less work for you because it's helping
the<00:03:47.769> plants<00:03:48.250> get<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.549> they<00:03:48.700> need<00:03:48.910> that's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
the plants get what they need that's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.690 
the plants get what they need that's
really<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.500> plants<00:03:50.829> are<00:03:50.950> in<00:03:50.980> charge<00:03:51.310> they

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
really the plants are in charge they

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.280 
really the plants are in charge they
communicate<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.419> soil<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.840> need<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.139> little

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
communicate to the soil I need a little

communicate to the soil I need a little

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
nitrogen today I need a little

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.550 
nitrogen today I need a little
phosphorous<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.269> it's<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.870> bacteria<00:03:56.079> the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
phosphorous and it's the bacteria the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.960 
phosphorous and it's the bacteria the
life<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:56.950> soil<00:03:57.099> that<00:03:57.340> brings<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.819> them

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
life in the soil that brings it to them

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.300 
life in the soil that brings it to them
ideally<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.959> would<00:03:59.139> add<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.680> organic<00:04:00.129> matter

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
ideally you would add the organic matter

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.970 
ideally you would add the organic matter
and<00:04:00.579> mix<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.269> into<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.510> soil<00:04:01.599> about<00:04:02.590> four<00:04:02.859> to

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
and mix it into the soil about four to

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.909 
and mix it into the soil about four to
six<00:04:03.010> inches<00:04:03.400> maybe<00:04:04.209> even<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> little<00:04:04.690> more<00:04:04.919> even

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
six inches maybe even a little more even

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.249 
six inches maybe even a little more even
a<00:04:06.130> little<00:04:06.459> bit<00:04:06.759> will<00:04:07.209> help<00:04:07.479> because<00:04:07.690> there<00:04:08.109> are

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:08.259 
a little bit will help because there are

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.200 
a little bit will help because there are
