00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.570
 and today we will make a cake in the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.210
 heart shape 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.830
 so here I already hit my whipped cream the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.470
 I use chantilly amelia 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.980
 I did not leave it very firm because 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.080
 to pass up is not good to put 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:41.680
 he too thin that if he is in danger 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:43.809
 to go and crack our cake so I 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.700
 I'll pass on my cake, it's already thought of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.950
 inside the rim 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.110
 How do I spend a year? 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.410
 amount of whipped cream I'll spend 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 ruler 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.759
 so now that I'm going to move the ruler 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.700
 to be able to make this cake here in 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:15.700
 It's up to him to be well. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.110
 reminding you, want me to 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.110
 working with one hand 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.440
 good here then already picked out Eduardo and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.020
 now I'm going to pass a light layer on 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:47.470
 around him to be able to work with 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.470
 he spout and swore using 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.610
 you can see that not xr you and is with 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.290
 He that I'm going to work on the side 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.270
 how often do people think 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.450
 that rises with sheet that gives to work 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.820
 on the side of the cake does not have several types 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.240
 of nozzle that gives to work both in the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.700
 edges as his side 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.490
 so good here then 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 I already started working it around 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:32.170
 him to advance the video 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.170
 so just look at this here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 for now it gives a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.720
 a pretty good effect on the cake because he 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.340
 It's the closed pitanga button, so it does not work. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.680
 it is not just to make the edges is 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:03.520
 He can work for us too. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:09.580
 with him on the side with the same rich 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:13.060
 I'll work with making them 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.060
 making the edges 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.390
 and here in the footer too 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.980
 so here I've already spent all my 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.980
 white, right? 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.680
 on the edge of the cake in the footer too now 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:04.060
 I'll see how the tombstones here I am. 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:06.870

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.870
 and the pitanga 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.210
 Good, and now let's make the roses for 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.370

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.330

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.300
 it is the 3 5 2 it has a format of a 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.350
 duck's beak and the color I'm wearing here 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.350
