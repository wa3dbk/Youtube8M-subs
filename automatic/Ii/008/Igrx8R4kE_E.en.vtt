00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 at sport friends i am simon muscle 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.240
 make some information today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.890
 to the ironmaxx bitter alanin that is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 Of course, known as a meaningful 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 meanwhile, they have been supplementing for a long time 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 no longer controversial because it's easy 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 a proved proven effect 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.699
 that means especially in the field of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 Muscle fatigue in the muscle area 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.150
 exhaustion and the whole thing has to do 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 course with the canoe see education 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.460
 could be proven by studies 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 the beta al ani besides proven 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.640
 This is effective as a supplement 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 Whole is meanwhile also in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 athletes circles already arrived relatively 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 So relatively uncontroversial times argues 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.780
 it does not matter anymore 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030
 it does not but you actually have 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 Studies that prove to him since 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 In 1992, by the way, is just one 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 Look now for effective supplement 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 Let's go to this bed alone 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.289
 constructed by ironmaxx is from german 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.809
 production without additives without 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.690
 more additional the ingredient list the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.910
 is conceivably short 100 percent pure 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.320
 weather alanin yes what can this leaves 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.879
 long I have already said that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 delay muscle fatigue 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.180
 what can not i do that too i can 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.260
 say you can not do it for example 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 give motivation 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.680
 I can not do that with training 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.960
 for your sake in areas 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 to go in where you automatically 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.189
 do not go in that means up here in the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 Everything has to be right there if it does 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.610
 sometime around the muscles around the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 muscular level goes there can pray alone 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.740
 Proven to be the good effect 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.180
 unfold 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.770
 So I think that's very important 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.040
 bought no pot motivation or 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.970
 something like that is just not there but 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.409
 nutritional supplement which of course 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.060
 has his reason for being 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.590
 I think very important in the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 I have to take you from Peter Landes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 fairer and honestly so to say it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 At the beginning of this tingle this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 tingling under the scalp under the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 under the soles of the feet on the chest 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 In the back I've got that in the field 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.770
 shoulders on the back and finds 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.360
 it just mega uncomfortable 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.220
 that feels like back 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 hair grow and just find it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.939
 Megamäßig disgusting that just lets me along 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 the time after that it's a complete one 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.270
 harmless harmless to health 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.130
 Side Effects 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.149
 so that is not no side effect in the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 actual senses but one 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.960
 casual effect many athletes find 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.070
 I can feel good about it myself 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 just do not explain how great this is 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 but maybe I have to 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.670
 say at the beginning with two to maximum 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.259
 three grams later start on 5 grams 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 go up here is a teaspoon 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.460
 recommended and a teaspoon are like that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.530
 approximately 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.540
 5 grams in the beginning it does if you do 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.890
 this feeling of pondering under the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.940
 I just do not like it so much 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 I hope you have a few 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.880
 information and weather alanin now in 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.350
 could give this video 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.090
 under the video in the video

 description in the infobox you can find 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.420
 of course , the link directly to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.890
 us in the muscle maker shop there is 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.930
 there is still a nutrition table there 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 more info all that i am in now 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.530
