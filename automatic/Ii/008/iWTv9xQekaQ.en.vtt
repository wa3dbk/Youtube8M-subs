hey guys and welcome this video is on

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.530 
hey guys and welcome this video is on
the<00:00:02.280> plugin<00:00:02.639> chess<00:00:02.879> commands<00:00:03.240> basically

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
the plugin chess commands basically

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.300 
the plugin chess commands basically
players<00:00:04.049> type<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.589> command<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.100> they<00:00:05.160> get

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
players type in a command and they get

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.249 
players type in a command and they get
given<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.640> virtual<00:00:05.819> chest<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.629> inside<00:00:06.990> there

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
given a virtual chest and inside there

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.570 
given a virtual chest and inside there
are<00:00:07.350> different<00:00:07.620> items<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.099> when<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:08.340> click

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
are different items and when they click

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.120 
are different items and when they click
them<00:00:08.760> they<00:00:08.790> run<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> command<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.830> basically

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
them they run a command so basically

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.830 
them they run a command so basically
this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> default<00:00:12.000> config<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.719> all

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
this is the default config and it's all

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.049 
this is the default config and it's all
changed<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.730> want<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:14.940> add

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
changed in here so if you want to add

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.910 
changed in here so if you want to add
another<00:00:15.330> item<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:16.020> copy<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.440> paste<00:00:16.680> an

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
another item just copy and paste an

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.670 
another item just copy and paste an
original<00:00:17.400> one<00:00:17.869> make<00:00:18.869> sure<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.350> line

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
original one make sure it's all in line

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.250 
original one make sure it's all in line
and<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.010> change<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.580> information<00:00:21.260> so

and then just change the information so

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
and then just change the information so
I'll<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.710> change<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> title<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.609> one

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
I'll just change the title of this one

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.839 
I'll just change the title of this one

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
want it to walk this time I just want it

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.359 
want it to walk this time I just want it
to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.560> time<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.220> tell<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> current<00:00:29.939> time

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
to do time so tell you the current time

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.180 
to do time so tell you the current time
and<00:00:32.369> obviously<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> says<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:35.130> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and obviously what it says so I want it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.240 
and obviously what it says so I want it
just<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.520> say<00:00:35.670> time<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.160> then<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
just to say time and then the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000 
just to say time and then the
description<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> item<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.010> basically

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
description of the item so basically

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.030 
description of the item so basically
this<00:00:41.250> item<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.820> tell<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:43.040> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
this item will just tell you the time so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.389 
this item will just tell you the time so
show<00:00:44.789> time

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
show time

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.490 
show time
then<00:00:47.399> next<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.329> choose<00:00:48.570> an<00:00:48.690> item<00:00:48.809> ID<00:00:49.050> for

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
then next I can choose an item ID for

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.330 
then next I can choose an item ID for
this<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.860> well<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> item<00:00:52.649> ID<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.160> be

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
this as well so I want the item ID to be

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
this as well so I want the item ID to be
a<00:00:53.579> clock<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.539> I'll<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.110> down<00:00:55.289> onto<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
a clock so I'll just go down onto the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
a clock so I'll just go down onto the
wiki<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> wiki<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> list<00:01:00.359> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
wiki then on the wiki it's got a list of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
wiki then on the wiki it's got a list of
all<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> ID<00:01:00.840> codes<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.739> I'll<00:01:01.949> just<00:01:02.100> quickly

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
all the ID codes so I'll just quickly

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.500 
all the ID codes so I'll just quickly
find<00:01:02.579> clock<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.809> somewhere<00:01:05.420> there<00:01:06.420> we

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
find clock down here somewhere there we

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.830 
find clock down here somewhere there we
go<00:01:06.659> those<00:01:06.840> clock<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.720> when<00:01:09.720> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
go those clock just there so when we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840 
go those clock just there so when we
found<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.369> copy<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> code

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
found it copy the code

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.240 
found it copy the code
so<00:01:12.270> obviously<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.869> three<00:01:13.110> four<00:01:13.320> seven<00:01:13.619> solar

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so obviously it's three four seven solar

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.140 
so obviously it's three four seven solar
do<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> type<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> also<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
do is type it in here so also the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
do is type it in here so also the
position<00:01:21.330> underneath<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.170> obviously<00:01:22.650> where

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
position underneath is obviously where

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
position underneath is obviously where
it<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.280> relativity<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> chest<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it is in relativity to the chest so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
it is in relativity to the chest so
obviously<00:01:25.890> I've<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.280> five<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.610> four<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
obviously I've got five and four is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
obviously I've got five and four is
already<00:01:27.509> taken<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.290> make<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> one

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
already taken so I want to make this one

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
already taken so I want to make this one
six<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:32.340> you'll<00:01:32.460> also<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
six and then you'll also see when you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 
six and then you'll also see when you
save<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.560> reload<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> server<00:01:35.659> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
save it and then reload the server that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.940 
save it and then reload the server that
they'll<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> exact<00:01:37.470> position<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
they'll be in the exact position that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
they'll be in the exact position that
you've<00:01:38.130> listed<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.420> obviously<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.960> is

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you've listed here so obviously this is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.190 
you've listed here so obviously this is
position<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.070> next<00:01:41.340> one's<00:01:41.520> position<00:01:41.909> two

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
position one the next one's position two

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.480 
position one the next one's position two
and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> close<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> chest<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and then to close the chest is in a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
and then to close the chest is in a
completely<00:01:44.909> different<00:01:45.060> position<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
completely different position this is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.889 
completely different position this is
over<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> bottom<00:01:47.159> right<00:01:47.430> hand<00:01:47.579> corner<00:01:47.899> so

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
over at the bottom right hand corner so

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.910 
over at the bottom right hand corner so
that's<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> nine<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> six

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that's what the nine and the six

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.090 
that's what the nine and the six
indicate<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
indicate so then all you have to do is
