you

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:31.710 

you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.210 

okay<00:00:32.720> we're<00:00:32.960> here<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.380> do<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.560> test<00:00:33.680> on<00:00:34.100> the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
okay we're here to do a test on the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.280 
okay we're here to do a test on the
water<00:00:34.370> buoys<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:35.060> see<00:00:35.270> if<00:00:35.480> they<00:00:35.690> will<00:00:35.870> indeed

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
water buoys to see if they will indeed

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.740 
water buoys to see if they will indeed
hold<00:00:36.680> four<00:00:37.190> pounds<00:00:37.580> of<00:00:37.700> weight<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.690> is

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
hold four pounds of weight this is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.290 
hold four pounds of weight this is
important<00:00:39.440> if<00:00:39.650> you<00:00:39.860> have<00:00:40.190> $2,000<00:00:41.000> worth<00:00:41.150> of

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
important if you have $2,000 worth of

00:00:41.300 --> 00:01:00.849 
important if you have $2,000 worth of
quadrocopter<00:00:42.550> floating<00:00:43.550> in<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.150> bay

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:56.350 

like<00:01:01.579> it's<00:01:01.699> pulling<00:01:01.940> harder<00:01:02.449> if<00:01:02.600> anything

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.300 

I<00:01:57.040> heard<00:01:58.040> them<00:01:58.250> reinf<00:01:58.670> lating<00:01:59.800> as<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:01.040> pulled

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
I heard them reinf lating as I pulled

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.180 
I heard them reinf lating as I pulled
them<00:02:01.430> out<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.760> water<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.300> I<00:02:02.330> suspect<00:02:03.190> they

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
them out of the water so I suspect they

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.020 
them out of the water so I suspect they
don't<00:02:04.400> like<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.760> inflate<00:02:05.120> under<00:02:05.420> pressure

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
don't like to inflate under pressure

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.200 
don't like to inflate under pressure
which<00:02:08.030> could<00:02:08.210> be<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> serious<00:02:08.810> issue<00:02:10.210> test

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
which could be a serious issue test

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:26.500 
which could be a serious issue test
number<00:02:11.750> two<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> single<00:02:13.070> two-liter<00:02:25.510> well

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
number two is a single two-liter well

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.160 
number two is a single two-liter well
that<00:02:26.690> clearly<00:02:27.200> works<00:02:27.470> although<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.750> not<00:02:29.960> as

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
that clearly works although it's not as

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.410 
that clearly works although it's not as
visible

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.710 

okay<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.350> we're<00:02:38.800> going<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.370> retest<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.480> water

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
okay so we're going to retest the water

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.690 
okay so we're going to retest the water
buoys<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.290> find<00:02:41.530> out<00:02:41.740> if<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> didn't<00:02:42.400> give<00:02:42.550> them

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
buoys to find out if I didn't give them

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.970 
buoys to find out if I didn't give them
enough<00:02:42.850> time<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.420> inflate<00:02:43.810> we're<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.740> put

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
enough time to inflate we're gonna put

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.290 
enough time to inflate we're gonna put
them<00:02:45.069> in<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.459> let<00:02:45.640> them<00:02:45.730> sit<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.120> at<00:02:46.180> least

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
them in and let them sit for at least

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.670 
them in and let them sit for at least
five<00:02:46.600> minutes<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.230> if<00:02:47.260> they'll<00:02:47.470> bring

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
five minutes to see if they'll bring

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.260 
five minutes to see if they'll bring
those<00:02:47.890> four<00:02:48.160> pounds<00:02:48.520> of<00:02:48.580> weight<00:02:48.790> out

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
those four pounds of weight out

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.110 
those four pounds of weight out
to<00:02:49.690> water<00:02:50.680> buoys<00:02:51.130> with<00:02:51.459> four<00:02:51.700> pounds<00:02:52.030> of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
to water buoys with four pounds of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.790 
to water buoys with four pounds of
weight<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.510> should<00:02:52.780> float<00:02:53.080> we've<00:02:53.650> already

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
weight it should float we've already

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.949 
weight it should float we've already
tested<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.340> once<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.850> floats<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.480> whether<00:02:55.780> it

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
tested it once it floats but whether it

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.490 
tested it once it floats but whether it
inflates<00:02:56.320> on<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.590> bottom<00:02:56.920> or<00:02:57.040> not<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:57.400> unknown

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
inflates on the bottom or not is unknown

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:12.470 
inflates on the bottom or not is unknown
so<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.650> one<00:02:59.740> more<00:02:59.860> time

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.860 

tides<00:03:13.110> going<00:03:13.440> out

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.259 

so<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.650> was<00:03:21.769> about<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.040> 60-second<00:03:22.849> mark<00:03:22.879> last

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
so it was about the 60-second mark last

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.140 
so it was about the 60-second mark last
time<00:03:23.569> when<00:03:24.080> they<00:03:24.230> came<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.470> okay<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:25.879> I<00:03:25.910> had

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
time when they came up okay but I had

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.680 
time when they came up okay but I had
lifted<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.720> at<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.080> 60-second<00:03:27.769> mark<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.690> if

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
lifted it at the 60-second mark so if

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:39.330 
lifted it at the 60-second mark so if
they<00:03:29.900> don't<00:03:30.099> look<00:03:31.099> at<00:03:31.250> all<00:03:31.340> those<00:03:31.459> jellyfish

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.890 

this<00:03:40.340> isn't<00:03:40.640> looking<00:03:40.730> good<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.390> not<00:03:41.540> looking

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
this isn't looking good it's not looking

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.940 
this isn't looking good it's not looking
good<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.590> my<00:03:43.310> belief<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:44.000> that<00:03:44.500> we're<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.530> 30

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
good so my belief is that we're in 30

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.100 
good so my belief is that we're in 30
feet<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.340> water<00:03:46.520> today<00:03:46.790> because<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.750> tide<00:03:47.930> has

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
feet of water today because the tide has

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.130 
feet of water today because the tide has
gone<00:03:48.260> out<00:03:48.500> some<00:03:49.090> my<00:03:50.090> belief<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.630> they<00:03:50.810> will<00:03:50.990> not

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
gone out some my belief is they will not

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.030 
gone out some my belief is they will not
inflate<00:03:51.470> under<00:03:51.740> pressure<00:03:53.020> at<00:03:54.020> 30<00:03:54.440> feet<00:03:54.710> it's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
inflate under pressure at 30 feet it's

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.640 
inflate under pressure at 30 feet it's
an<00:03:55.280> extra<00:03:55.580> atmosphere<00:03:56.180> 14.7<00:03:57.170> pounds<00:03:57.320> so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
an extra atmosphere 14.7 pounds so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.560 
an extra atmosphere 14.7 pounds so
they're<00:03:57.890> at<00:03:58.010> 28<00:03:58.430> pounds<00:03:58.760> of<00:03:58.850> PIAT<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.270> pressure

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
they're at 28 pounds of PIAT of pressure

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.340 
they're at 28 pounds of PIAT of pressure
yeah

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
yeah

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.830 
yeah
so<00:04:00.860> it's<00:04:01.040> going<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.220> take<00:04:01.400> 60<00:04:01.880> psi<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.390> blow<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
so it's going to take 60 psi to blow the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.180 
so it's going to take 60 psi to blow the
balloon<00:04:03.080> up<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.890> any<00:04:04.100> amount<00:04:06.040> that's<00:04:07.040> not

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
balloon up to any amount that's not

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.040 
balloon up to any amount that's not
looking<00:04:07.370> good<00:04:07.670> on<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.880> test<00:04:08.210> I<00:04:08.510> think<00:04:08.690> my

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
looking good on the test I think my

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.540 
looking good on the test I think my
theory<00:04:09.410> is<00:04:09.500> correct<00:04:09.740> that<00:04:10.010> there's<00:04:10.250> just<00:04:10.430> too

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
theory is correct that there's just too

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.000 
theory is correct that there's just too
much<00:04:10.640> pressure<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.300> think<00:04:11.690> you're<00:04:11.990> right<00:04:12.110> but

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
much pressure I think you're right but

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.860 
much pressure I think you're right but
we'll<00:04:13.460> give<00:04:13.580> it<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.730> full<00:04:13.910> five<00:04:14.240> minutes

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.870 

and<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:21.500> we'll<00:04:21.709> start<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:22.070> bring<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.490> up<00:04:22.610> very

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and then we'll start to bring it up very

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.680 
and then we'll start to bring it up very
slow<00:04:23.300> okay

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
slow okay

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
slow okay
okay<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.500> am<00:04:26.890> seeing<00:04:27.370> oh<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:29.260> see<00:04:29.710> something<00:04:30.100> okay

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
okay I am seeing oh I see something okay

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.500 
okay I am seeing oh I see something okay

they're just now starting to inflate no
they<00:04:34.810> are<00:04:35.050> inflated<00:04:36.510> look<00:04:37.510> at<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.780> can<00:04:38.170> you

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
they are inflated look at that can you

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.990 
they are inflated look at that can you
see<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.650> down<00:04:38.800> there<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.070> can<00:04:39.280> see<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.460> yeah

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
let's let's try to do this with my face

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.870 
let's let's try to do this with my face
as<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.500> shadow<00:04:47.770> cuz<00:04:48.100> then<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.250> can<00:04:48.400> actually<00:04:48.550> do

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
as the shadow cuz then I can actually do

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.830 
as the shadow cuz then I can actually do
like<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.420> can<00:04:49.720> actually<00:04:49.870> see<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:51.570> so<00:04:52.570> how<00:04:52.690> much

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
like I can actually see that so how much

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.750 
like I can actually see that so how much
length<00:04:53.200> do<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.680> on<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.950> rope<00:04:54.130> know<00:04:54.370> at

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
length do you have on the rope know at

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.180 
length do you have on the rope know at
this<00:04:54.970> point<00:04:55.270> in<00:04:55.360> time<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.170> about<00:04:56.470> 12<00:04:56.920> feet

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
this point in time that is about 12 feet

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.650 
this point in time that is about 12 feet
under<00:04:57.700> there<00:04:57.880> maybe<00:04:58.150> 15<00:04:58.630> feet<00:05:00.450> okay<00:05:01.450> that's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
under there maybe 15 feet okay that's

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.540 
under there maybe 15 feet okay that's
about<00:05:01.840> 10<00:05:02.200> feet<00:05:02.440> right<00:05:02.680> there<00:05:02.950> they're

quadcopter on the end of this line you

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.929 
quadcopter on the end of this line you
would<00:05:40.139> be<00:05:40.259> hiring<00:05:40.649> a<00:05:40.710> diver<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.369> recover<00:05:41.669> it

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
would be hiring a diver to recover it

they're<00:05:52.139> still<00:05:52.349> inflating<00:05:52.860> they<00:05:53.009> don't<00:05:53.159> like

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
they're still inflating they don't like

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:00.260 
they're still inflating they don't like
any<00:05:53.580> pressure<00:05:53.909> whatsoever<00:05:58.759> now<00:05:59.759> could<00:06:00.059> it<00:06:00.149> be

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
any pressure whatsoever now could it be

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.059 
any pressure whatsoever now could it be
because<00:06:00.419> of<00:06:00.599> the<00:06:00.779> weight<00:06:00.990> doubtful

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
because of the weight doubtful

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.339 
because of the weight doubtful
shouldn't<00:06:02.490> matter<00:06:02.879> they<00:06:03.180> held<00:06:03.779> the<00:06:03.930> weight<00:06:04.080> up

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
shouldn't matter they held the weight up

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:12.790 
shouldn't matter they held the weight up
in<00:06:04.559> fact<00:06:04.830> we<00:06:05.819> test<00:06:06.089> this<00:06:06.209> again<00:06:10.490> they<00:06:11.490> float

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
in fact we test this again they float

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.769 
in fact we test this again they float
very<00:06:13.800> positive<00:06:14.369> buoyant<00:06:14.759> they're<00:06:15.479> just

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779 
very positive buoyant they're just

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.579 
very positive buoyant they're just
unable<00:06:16.199> to<00:06:16.409> overcome<00:06:16.709> the<00:06:17.459> pressure<00:06:17.849> at<00:06:18.240> depth

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:18.589 
unable to overcome the pressure at depth

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:21.320 
unable to overcome the pressure at depth
exactly<00:06:19.619> it<00:06:19.949> took<00:06:20.129> nine<00:06:20.580> feet<00:06:20.909> before<00:06:21.149> it

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
exactly it took nine feet before it

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.679 
exactly it took nine feet before it
began<00:06:21.629> coming<00:06:21.990> up<00:06:22.080> on<00:06:22.229> its<00:06:22.379> own<00:06:22.529> right<00:06:23.449> so<00:06:24.449> I'm

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:24.689 
began coming up on its own right so I'm

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:31.009 
began coming up on its own right so I'm
sold<00:06:25.110> there<00:06:27.379> these<00:06:28.379> are<00:06:28.499> not<00:06:28.949> the<00:06:29.159> answer<00:06:30.019> to
