00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.930
 surprise the enemy with the sony xperia z 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.880
 sony xperia z was from both the front 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.410
 as from the back completely made of glass 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.000
 made and there was none of the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.859
 sony smartphones since a number 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.880
 year which they actually were peacock 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.079
 with competitors 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.060
 so finally a smartphone 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.859
 introduced equal specifically from 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.169
 sat like a competitors and that when she 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.460
 has really know very well buy co 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.989
 thanks to it you can wear in the shower 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.029
 traditionally warm and also slow 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.590
 Drugs from Samsung Galaxy S4 that film 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.960
 came out because the device is so new 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.500
 January and on February at the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.420
 market 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.240
 but now is time for a 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.370
 successor and then the sony xperia z1 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.470
 and we have the first new here 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.610
 successor to the sony xperia z and his 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.380
 really a very nice phone 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.840
 I'm going to tell in this video preview 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.280
 what we think of this sony xperia z1 i 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.930
 also go briefly and as the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 functionality and what us in them 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.960
 finding is 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.060
 sony xperia z1 is also k 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.980
 specifications really a powerhouse 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.320
 if we look at these cards start 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.970
 features he came 800 you will be on 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.710
 two point two gerts is a quad core 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.840
 chip and its newest generation 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.539
 chips that are your own on the market and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.409
 this is actually so nothing is plzz 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.689
 the first smartphone 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.549
 in addition to xperia ultra naturally that kinaci 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.289
 my hand has no that also goes this tip 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.399
 what they are so important 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.630
 in this job 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.100
 of course that deletion just really good 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.119
 is just that in combination with two 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.950
 gone ram 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.780
 whatever is in this device and just 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.859
 very wide bandwidth really does matter 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.149
 very quick 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.609
 he will be provided with and lucy as standard 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.829
 point 2 has a 20 megapixel camera 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.899
 where I will come back later from a 5 inch 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.189
 screen with a full hd resolution and one 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.630
 team girls panel 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.880
 doing our panel we also find one 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.069
 xperia z ultra so a slightly better screen 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 then that of xperia z and that he really there 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.399
 you just sharp half this full hd 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.990
 really beautiful 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.880
 heroes he has reached black very well 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.380
 very good much better than with the xperia z 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.179
 actually and we think that's great 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.829
 plus the expert screen 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.450
 thought it would be a bit dull and found 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.229
 like and sometimes color range should not either 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 absolutely great 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.069
 but with this xperia z1 I just notice 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.200
 that it goes much better and if we really 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.670
 a big advantage 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.170
 expert put one also has a slightly different one 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.150
 build opportunity made of 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.160
 aluminum in euros 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.200
 the front and back still of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.700
 dragon tail glass own type of google 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.370
 glass it is very sturdy and scratch-free 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 but what advantage is that he meets the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.730
 side is therefore made more 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.500
 it is a lot more robust also 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.880
 another advantage of this new build you 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.160
 that Sony also has fewer clips on it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.690
 are so full three and half mm headphone 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
 jacket has no flap on the side 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.470
 You can find example of a pin 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.910
 it is best to put it on, but continue 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.290
 but can also charge 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.820
 That just means he's the device 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 is more secure if you are under water 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.260
 throws and this xperia z draftsman again 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.570
 again under water when she can 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.190
 to go underwater for half an hour 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.020
 and he is also fabrics and so 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.459
 waterproof and that we really really cool 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.920
 they can also take a shower under water 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.420
 that they are laughing but other thing is 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.070
 that you must xperia z you never come 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.750
 take underwater pictures 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.250
 He also has someone like that measure XPRT 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.950
 to solve they have namely one 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.480
 room button added to device but 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.510
 that's that his predecessor doesn't licks 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.830
 przy put so puts a whole can and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.360
 if you look at the top of which you 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.800
 as a camera button and thus received 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 just very quickly just in photo 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.250
 start up and just a camera 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.080
 and shoot photos and so do we 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.239
 under water and you can finally go with 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.040
 shoot your xp and underwater pictures 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.390
 that is really cool 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 and then when talking about the room 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.850
 is a new room in that 20 megapixel 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.950
 stab is this 20 megapixel camera 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.450
 also got their gls and none 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.130
 lens is proclaiming the compact 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.390
 sony cameras themselves 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.950
 The advantage of that is that you have a lot 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.780
 has a larger viewing angle so can do a lot 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.610
 taking photos below was also the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.100
 photo quality is much better and light 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.450
 on also read much better room from experts 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.470
 from one it looks really really good 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.600
 he is very fast 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.370
 but sit by photo and quality 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.150
 just really really fast and really just 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.860
 very well 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.300
 the colors are good and the view 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.739
 sharp is also very good 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.720
 well that light output also in dark 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.730
 environments that the body does 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.530
 great, but it must take a while 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.790
 say that here is even better care 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.060
 two pays off is not the final 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.980
 release 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.120
 as soon as you put them in the store so there 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.870
 need a little more effort 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.130
 to hold 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.900
 but while printed matter and such a boy 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.519
 put this room down again 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.780
 we think the camera is much better than that 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.489
 from an xperia z than android itself like 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.170
 said up and do four point two 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.180
 latest version in its latest version 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.680
 from android and their beeper 3 will too 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.019
 had arrived because Sony already has 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.799
 arrived from xperia z ultra and for the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.959
 xperia z 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.280
 so they just big that they xperia z1 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.919
 about android 4 per three in the short term 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.380
 but what is that quickly the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.580
 ailment bowl on 800 chip 2 gram 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.289
 you just don't slow down your own 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.340
 when she's just instant 'everything works 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.900
 just seamless 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.520
 whatever you yourself really like 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.750
 that sony interface is not that busy 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.220
 is you don't have it that much 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.090
 bloatware you have no non aunt things 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.440
 sit in it 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.120
 you can actually adjust everything 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.800
 almost a clean android skin actually 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.449
 with a few keys bubble here but 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.580
 nothing too much and we really find that ourselves 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.750
 very pleasant and ter for common 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.310
 really really fast 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.810
 even though this is another test phase 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.400
 quail we sitting on it 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.020
 then so against you just really hope 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.940
 very fast and just feels like you 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.840
 random application starts then goes 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.789
 it just instant 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.110
 the works really pretty cool too 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.810
 therefore takes applications 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.880
 switching is just effortless and years 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.949
 start the room because we also just a moment 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.740
 show the sleep mode 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:11.370
 that is also going to be special 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.830
 quickly and you also have to take a photo 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.780
 that also works very well, because otherwise too 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.009
 agree with this smartphone that is sorry 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.960
 few new functionality in the 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.460
 cameras or two equally fitted him 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.020
 namely added a few armies 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.460
 a camera software so that you have the camera 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.860
 software does not need to, for example 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.909
 you share photos via social media but 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.870
 are also a few other things on 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.520
 added 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.530
 so first of all you have a camera 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.210
 software also human how you added the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.310
 an example of floating mister you 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.780
 you see where buildings or information but 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.789
 can also look up information or products 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.560
 do you have glasmeier for you can you after one 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.820
 take photo of the barcode and goes 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.009
 that automatic product looking him 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.840
 told you a bit more about the other whole 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.789
 top function, we find that none 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.259
 manufacturer has so far been 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.599
 for live video streaming from you 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.229
 phone to facebook that's best 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.610
 really cool 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.190
 such a first is the manufacturer that 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.690
 has this facility has socialife and 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.580
 being able to socialize is live video 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.229
 stream to your facebook so i live 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.490
 first social life in the menu 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.199
 then select who you want 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.820
 You can invite friends to share them 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.169
 only they may see but I also say 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.610
 want everyone to see or just mine 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.690
 friends can see it all 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.219
 preset 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.870
 according to bg you stream me and still in the 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.340
 phone like a silly you videos 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.570
 stream to facebook 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.800
 there you can all your friends so that 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.659
 watch live and that was and still 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.340
 functionality and especially when you check 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.320
 this phone is also about 4g 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.940
 so ltd provides another 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.860
 would be available at the Netherlands 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.120
 with 4g you just have fun and you can 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.740
 just be silly so you videos that 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.980
 during a concert or whatever 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.380
 live to your facebook or all your friends 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.150
 conveniently taken another large 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.140
 The advantage of this xperia z1 is that it 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.950
 also has a larger battery 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.110
 received 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.360
 3000 milliamps with 3000 more than 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.380
 definitely limit your fun on it does it 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.840
 something has become heavier for us 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.560
 feeling carries the same weight z 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.610
 ultra 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.710
 slightly worse school not very much 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.300
 but it also brings the army but 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.800
 than the phone is true but whole 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.450
 sturdy and just that much longer 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.710
 must go beyond his predecessor another 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.450
 nice thing that such that also in this 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.980
 xperia z1 a seat is a big one 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.540
 speaker at the bottom 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.160
 biggest peaks is really pretty big 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.570
 did that just sound good 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.610
 We come not so well themselves can 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.990
 testing is due to the software but later 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.370
 just expect a really cheating 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.200
 very good sound will give 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.550
 it 's pretty handy well in the end 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.860
 Of course you can also change the memory 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.300
 extend to gigabyte tokens when they 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.160
 is then lived in the 16 gigabyte 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.540
 variant and more so a micro sd 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.190
 You can just order a card on the side 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.080
 nice expand to actually so much 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.790
 you want and that is big o big advantage 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.170
 for many people 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.050
 then a few practical things 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.060

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.320

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.770
 4 weeks 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.930

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.810

 that will be the suggested retail price 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.560
 and of course it is nice too 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.330
