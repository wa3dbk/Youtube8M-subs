00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:06.679 
hey guys get in a boxy for today on the

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.180 
hey guys get in a boxy for today on the
i/o<00:00:07.399> cell<00:00:07.759> net<00:00:08.269> disk<00:00:08.539> this<00:00:09.349> takes<00:00:09.680> a<00:00:09.950> regular

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
i/o cell net disk this takes a regular

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.849 
i/o cell net disk this takes a regular
hard<00:00:10.700> drive<00:00:10.760> SATA<00:00:11.389> and<00:00:11.719> turns<00:00:12.469> it<00:00:12.619> into<00:00:12.650> a

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:12.859 
hard drive SATA and turns it into a

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.220 
hard drive SATA and turns it into a
network<00:00:13.219> hard<00:00:13.609> drive<00:00:13.850> USB<00:00:14.389> and<00:00:14.840> I<00:00:15.020> believe

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
network hard drive USB and I believe

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.890 
network hard drive USB and I believe
firewire<00:00:15.820> hard<00:00:16.820> drive<00:00:17.029> I'll<00:00:17.150> be<00:00:17.269> using<00:00:17.510> is

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
firewire hard drive I'll be using is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.060 
firewire hard drive I'll be using is
this<00:00:18.849> Seagate<00:00:19.849> 1000<00:00:20.630> gigabyte<00:00:21.020> roar<00:00:21.590> terabyte

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
this Seagate 1000 gigabyte roar terabyte

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.430 
this Seagate 1000 gigabyte roar terabyte
hard<00:00:22.610> drive<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.260> install<00:00:24.260> that<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:24.619> there<00:00:24.830> so

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
hard drive so install that in there so

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
hard drive so install that in there so
let's<00:00:27.440> unbox<00:00:27.890> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.049 

Ethernet<00:00:42.790> cable<00:00:46.860> eSATA<00:00:47.860> cable<00:00:48.190> if<00:00:48.700> you<00:00:48.910> need

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
Ethernet cable eSATA cable if you need

00:00:49.059 --> 00:01:09.170 
Ethernet cable eSATA cable if you need
it<00:00:51.150> and<00:00:52.890> USB<00:00:53.890> 2.0<00:00:58.260> yeah<00:00:59.290> just<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.680> enclosure

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.440 

so<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.300> hard<00:01:10.540> drive<00:01:10.780> just<00:01:11.350> slides<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:11.979> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so the hard drive just slides in this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.990 
so the hard drive just slides in this
case<00:01:13.450> right<00:01:13.750> here<00:01:16.560> which<00:01:17.560> will<00:01:17.710> then<00:01:17.910> screw<00:01:18.910> it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
case right here which will then screw it

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.560 
case right here which will then screw it
in<00:01:19.090> right<00:01:19.630> there<00:01:20.520> he<00:01:21.520> pops<00:01:21.790> them<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.180> eSATA

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
in right there he pops them to the eSATA

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.040 
in right there he pops them to the eSATA
connection<00:01:22.780> right<00:01:23.170> there

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
connection right there

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.820 
connection right there
now<00:01:26.050> we<00:01:26.110> screw<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.680> hard<00:01:26.979> drive<00:01:27.250> back<00:01:27.640> into

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
now we screw the hard drive back into

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.700 
now we screw the hard drive back into
its<00:01:29.830> connection<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.840> after<00:01:35.080> that<00:01:35.229> we<00:01:35.440> put<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
its connection and after that we put the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.270 
its connection and after that we put the
case<00:01:35.890> on<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.910> now<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.119> enclosure<00:01:38.280> putting

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
case on so now the enclosure putting

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
case on so now the enclosure putting
this<00:01:39.399> up<00:01:39.610> here<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.259> we<00:01:41.410> should<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.590> good<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.770> go
