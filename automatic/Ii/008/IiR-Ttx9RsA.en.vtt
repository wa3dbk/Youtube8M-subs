I<00:03:40.549> need<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.120> say<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.390> crowd<00:03:41.599> were<00:03:41.840> happy<00:03:42.469> about

I need to say the crowd were happy about
that<00:03:42.829> one<00:03:42.980> would<00:03:43.129> be<00:03:43.219> an<00:03:43.280> understatement

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.370 

I<00:03:49.640> don't<00:03:50.640> believe<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.330> taken<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.720> order<00:03:54.380> which

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
I don't believe was taken in order which

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.830 
I don't believe was taken in order which
to<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:55.950> honest<00:03:56.310> leaves<00:03:56.580> him<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:57.209> very<00:03:57.720> difficult

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
to be honest leaves him a very difficult

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.949 
to be honest leaves him a very difficult
task<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.370> clean-and-jerk<00:03:59.660> to<00:04:00.660> be<00:04:00.750> 10

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
task and the clean-and-jerk to be 10

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.380 
task and the clean-and-jerk to be 10
kilos<00:04:01.350> adrift<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.640> lot<00:04:02.819> even<00:04:03.180> for

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
kilos adrift that's it's a lot even for

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.330 
kilos adrift that's it's a lot even for
a<00:04:03.540> man<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:03.990> with<00:04:04.610> Ivanov<00:04:05.610> capabilities

incidentally<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.430> Ivanov<00:04:08.820> loses<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.810> will<00:04:09.900> be

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
incidentally if Ivanov loses it will be

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.720 
incidentally if Ivanov loses it will be
the<00:04:10.050> first<00:04:10.080> time<00:04:10.470> he's<00:04:10.530> ever<00:04:10.680> lost<00:04:11.550> a

wondering<00:05:14.500> how<00:05:14.860> much<00:05:15.010> more<00:05:15.310> could<00:05:15.550> he<00:05:15.670> do<00:05:16.050> what

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
wondering how much more could he do what

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.390 
wondering how much more could he do what
he's<00:05:17.200> not<00:05:17.350> going<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.590> be<00:05:17.680> able<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:18.070> do<00:05:18.190> anymore

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
he's not going to be able to do anymore

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.160 
he's not going to be able to do anymore
because<00:05:18.700> you're<00:05:18.880> only<00:05:19.030> allowed<00:05:19.390> three<00:05:19.780> lifts

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
because you're only allowed three lifts

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.870 
because you're only allowed three lifts
and<00:05:20.290> that's<00:05:20.410> probably<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.920> as<00:05:21.070> well<00:05:21.130> because

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
and that's probably just as well because

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.760 
and that's probably just as well because
let's<00:05:22.240> hope<00:05:22.480> that<00:05:22.750> those<00:05:22.900> three<00:05:23.170> lifts<00:05:23.590> are

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770
