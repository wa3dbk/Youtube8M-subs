 I'm going to show you how we can 

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:11.809
 increase the performance of our pc to 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.990
 100% The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.420
 enter system properties 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.779

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.520
 properties 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.410

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.570
 we will enter the tab that says

 advanced options 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.390
 here what interests us is to enter 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 this part that says performance for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.450
 this is going to click on the button that

 We click and ask for a size 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.530
 initial 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.909
 and in maximum size in this part the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.170
 values ​​that we are going to put 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.340
 is the one that comes down here where it says 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.350
 recommended this value should go in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.040
 Initial size and maximum size 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 it must be exactly the same value for 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.500
 the two fields we type 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.190
 once we type 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.490
 the value we click on the button that says 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.610
 establish 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 and here they show us these values 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.789
 established 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 and here our unit appears good 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.070
 here we are going to click on the button that 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.070

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.040
 message nothing else they give to accept 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 and since we are here in this part in 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.190
 this window will appear enabled 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.180
 this button that says apply in this case 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.170
 it does not appear to me because I 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.110
 I have already modified these 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.700
 values you click on the button 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.510

 accept will ask them to restart in the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.920
 system in this case because to me I do not 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.770
 it seemed because I repeat I already did these 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.620
 modifications if you have to 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.680
 restart once they start 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.299

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.390
 will open this window that is where we 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.819
 the configuration utilities appear 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.670

 it's called no pross sorry 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.190
 here what it shows us 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.430
 is the number of cores of our 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.640
 processor in this case well I'm 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.050
 a computer that has only one 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.449
 nucleus 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.759
 if you have a processor that 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:34.590
 is 2 cores 3 or 4 here they have to 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.410
 select 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.050
 the greater number that appears 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.210
 they select and then they go to 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.600
 select this option that is called max 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.700
 mmmm the maximum memory click 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.700
 and it will automatically appear 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:57.099
 in the capacity that has to have 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.940
 installed ram memory in its 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.550
 computer 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.200
 anyway we are going to click on this 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.889
 button that has the little arrow 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.610
 up to make sure it's 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:14.350
 the maximum click and if it does not increase 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.729
 well now what we will do is 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:21.180
 see click on the button that says accept 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:24.860
 then in this window we click on the 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.530
 button that says apply ready 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.090
 here and after applied the changes 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.750
 we click on the button and serra 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.810
 and will ask them to restart 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.970
 obviously they have to restart 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.270
 and then once the system started 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.520
 will notice the changes that then 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.060
 really if it works 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.580
 hopefully and that this very useful 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.780
 tutorial I hope you liked them 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.780
