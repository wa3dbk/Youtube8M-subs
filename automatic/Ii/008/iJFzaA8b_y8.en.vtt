you'll be able to answer my questions
once<00:00:36.960> more<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.370> first<00:00:38.640> thing<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> noticed

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
once more the first thing that I noticed

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840 
once more the first thing that I noticed
with<00:00:39.809> character<00:00:40.530> creation<00:00:40.920> was<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.760> were

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
with character creation was there were

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.479 
with character creation was there were
no<00:00:42.030> more<00:00:42.059> sliders<00:00:42.510> yeah<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.250> whole<00:00:44.460> game

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
no more sliders yeah and the whole game

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
no more sliders yeah and the whole game
feels<00:00:45.210> much<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.690> intuitive<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.489> move

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
feels much more intuitive you can move

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
feels much more intuitive you can move
rooms<00:00:47.910> around<00:00:48.120> things<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.079> you

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
rooms around things like that can you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
rooms around things like that can you
tell<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.770> about<00:00:49.800> those<00:00:50.160> mechanics<00:00:50.850> yeah

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
tell more about those mechanics yeah

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700 
tell more about those mechanics yeah
absolutely<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.500> we

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
absolutely so one of the things we

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
absolutely so one of the things we
wanted<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> sims<00:00:53.760> 4<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.180> simplify

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
wanted to do in the sims 4 is simplify

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
wanted to do in the sims 4 is simplify
it<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.989> make<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.440> accessible<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.160> our

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it and make it more accessible to our

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.240 
it and make it more accessible to our
new<00:00:56.640> players<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> what

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
new players so with what with that what

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
new players so with what with that what
we<00:00:59.340> did<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.670> ended<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.090> eliminating<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we did is we ended up eliminating the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
we did is we ended up eliminating the
sliders<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.680> manipulation<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> sims

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
sliders all the manipulation on the sims

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
sliders all the manipulation on the sims
and<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> rooms<00:01:03.660> themselves<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:04.650> actually

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and the rooms themselves are actually

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
and the rooms themselves are actually
right<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> body<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> blocks<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
right there on the body or the blocks so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
right there on the body or the blocks so
it's<00:01:07.650> much<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.830> intuitive<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.670> involves

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it's much more intuitive it involves

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's much more intuitive it involves
pushing<00:01:09.299> pulling<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.020> fans<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.920> still

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
pushing pulling and fans can still

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.070 
pushing pulling and fans can still
create<00:01:11.369> whatever<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.890> very<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
create whatever they want very good I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.420 
create whatever they want very good I
one<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.380> bothered<00:01:16.740> me<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
one thing that bothered me was the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
one thing that bothered me was the
neighborhood's<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.299> felt<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.259> point<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
neighborhood's I felt at one point I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
neighborhood's I felt at one point I
tried<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.979> zoom<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:22.140> felt<00:01:22.470> less<00:01:23.100> open

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
tried to zoom out and it felt less open

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.340 
tried to zoom out and it felt less open
than<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> sims<00:01:24.210> 3<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.570> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> felt<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
than in the sims 3 it kind of felt like

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
than in the sims 3 it kind of felt like
a<00:01:25.439> step<00:01:25.770> back<00:01:26.070> towards<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.549> sim<00:01:26.790> 2<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
a step back towards the sim 2 is that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
a step back towards the sim 2 is that
because<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> low<00:01:29.369> D<00:01:29.430> screen<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
because there was a low D screen and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.690 
because there was a low D screen and
yeah<00:01:30.479> yeah<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.170> um<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.829> did<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> sims

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
yeah yeah so um what we did in the sims

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.569 
yeah yeah so um what we did in the sims
4<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.259> as<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> remember<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> sims<00:01:35.220> 3<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
4 is as you remember in the sims 3 it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
4 is as you remember in the sims 3 it
was<00:01:35.790> vast<00:01:36.119> open<00:01:36.420> worlds<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.110> oftentimes

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
was vast open worlds but oftentimes

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
was vast open worlds but oftentimes
those<00:01:38.040> felt<00:01:38.340> empty<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
those felt empty so you would go to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
those felt empty so you would go to
different<00:01:40.020> lots<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:40.799> only<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
different lots and there would only be a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
different lots and there would only be a
couple<00:01:41.189> sims<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.540> really

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
couple sims there so what we really

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
couple sims there so what we really
wanted<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.409> create<00:01:43.649> these<00:01:43.860> vibrant

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
wanted to do is create these vibrant

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
wanted to do is create these vibrant
lush<00:01:44.880> neighborhoods<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> lot<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
lush neighborhoods with a lot of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
lush neighborhoods with a lot of
activity<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:47.490> into<00:01:47.640> neighborhoods

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
activity and going into neighborhoods

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
activity and going into neighborhoods
actually<00:01:48.570> allowed<00:01:48.780> us<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.500> sims<00:01:49.920> on

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
actually allowed us to get more sims on

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.039 
actually allowed us to get more sims on
the<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:51.149> screen<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.600> same<00:01:51.659> time

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the on screen at the same time

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
the on screen at the same time
simulating<00:01:53.009> simultaneously<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.390> feels

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
simulating simultaneously so it feels

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.139 
simulating simultaneously so it feels
much<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:54.990> active<00:01:55.549> okay<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:56.909> basically

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
much more active okay so it's basically

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.030 
much more active okay so it's basically
just<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.750> question<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.110> Technology<00:01:58.290> yeah

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
just a question of Technology yeah

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.469 
just a question of Technology yeah
absolutely<00:01:59.490> i<00:01:59.880> mean<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> give

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to create so we went with this route

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.749 
to create so we went with this route
okay<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> had<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> loading<00:02:08.039> screens<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
okay and so I had the loading screens I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.940 
okay and so I had the loading screens I
mean<00:02:09.239> loading<00:02:09.629> times<00:02:09.840> briefly<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.800> out

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
mean loading times briefly to get out

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.809 
mean loading times briefly to get out
you<00:02:11.489> how<00:02:11.940> long<00:02:12.209> are<00:02:12.420> those

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
you how long are those

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.910 
you how long are those
get<00:02:13.420> back<00:02:13.569> in<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.349> couple<00:02:14.530> seconds

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
like if if you went out into the map

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.229 
like if if you went out into the map
view<00:02:17.280> cancelling<00:02:18.280> travel<00:02:18.639> will<00:02:18.879> actually

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
view cancelling travel will actually

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.459 
view cancelling travel will actually
just<00:02:19.480> take<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.749> right<00:02:19.900> back<00:02:19.930> into<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.349> game

so okay great and I noticed there are
some<00:02:23.530> key<00:02:24.519> features<00:02:24.730> things<00:02:25.239> that<00:02:25.359> people

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
some key features things that people

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.239 
some key features things that people
like<00:02:26.109> like<00:02:26.349> swimming<00:02:26.739> pools<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.069> are

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
like like swimming pools that are

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.240 
like like swimming pools that are
missing<00:02:28.109> why<00:02:29.109> is<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.290> what<00:02:29.680> what

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
missing why is that what what

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.830 
missing why is that what what
compensates<00:02:30.879> for<00:02:30.969> those<00:02:31.269> things<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.750> are

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
compensates for those things that are

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.050 
compensates for those things that are
missing<00:02:32.109> yeah<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.159> sims<00:02:33.370> 4<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:33.819> really

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
missing yeah so in the sims 4 we really

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.940 
missing yeah so in the sims 4 we really
wanted<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.389> build<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.840> solid<00:02:35.139> foundation<00:02:35.319> to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
wanted to build a solid foundation to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.890 
wanted to build a solid foundation to
start<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.730> one<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.389> things<00:02:37.629> that<00:02:37.719> we

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
start with and one of the things that we

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.990 
start with and one of the things that we
did<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.260> made<00:02:38.409> our<00:02:38.709> sims<00:02:39.010> more<00:02:39.340> real<00:02:39.700> more

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
did is we made our sims more real more

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.179 
did is we made our sims more real more
true<00:02:40.569> more<00:02:40.900> relatable<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.590> more<00:02:41.739> believable

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
true more relatable and more believable

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.610 
true more relatable and more believable
than<00:02:42.340> ever<00:02:42.730> before<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.810> there's<00:02:44.169> a<00:02:44.230> lot<00:02:44.409> of<00:02:44.469> the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
than ever before so there's a lot of the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.319 
than ever before so there's a lot of the
technology<00:02:45.189> that<00:02:45.370> actually<00:02:45.400> went<00:02:45.849> in<00:02:46.060> under

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
technology that actually went in under

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.179 
technology that actually went in under
the<00:02:46.450> hood<00:02:46.750> because<00:02:47.349> everything<00:02:47.950> has<00:02:48.069> been

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
the hood because everything has been

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.039 
the hood because everything has been
rebuilt<00:02:48.639> from<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.849> ground<00:02:48.939> up<00:02:49.329> so<00:02:49.780> when<00:02:49.930> you

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
rebuilt from the ground up so when you

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.360 
rebuilt from the ground up so when you
see<00:02:50.230> these<00:02:50.409> sins<00:02:50.709> out<00:02:50.889> in<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.189> world

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
see these sins out in the world

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.149 
see these sins out in the world
interacting<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.239> other<00:02:52.480> sims<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.379> really<00:02:53.859> is

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
interacting with other sims it really is

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.009 
interacting with other sims it really is
recognizable<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.269> oh<00:02:55.419> they're<00:02:55.719> actually

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019
