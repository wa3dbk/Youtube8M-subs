Eugene this is a microwave looks pretty

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.799 
Eugene this is a microwave looks pretty
innocent<00:00:36.170> doesn't<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.730> lurking<00:00:38.360> inside

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
innocent doesn't it but lurking inside

innocent doesn't it but lurking inside
this<00:00:39.200> microwave<00:00:39.680> of<00:00:39.920> powerful<00:00:40.399> forces

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
this microwave of powerful forces

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.150 
this microwave of powerful forces
waiting<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.420> be<00:00:41.510> unleashed<00:00:41.860> what<00:00:42.860> you've<00:00:43.010> got

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
waiting to be unleashed what you've got

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.930 
waiting to be unleashed what you've got
to<00:00:43.250> do<00:00:43.460> is<00:00:43.820> put<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.809> right<00:00:45.020> stuff<00:00:45.380> in<00:00:45.559> them<00:00:45.940> so

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
to do is put the right stuff in them so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.299 
to do is put the right stuff in them so
the<00:00:47.090> first<00:00:47.300> experiment<00:00:47.899> is<00:00:48.410> with<00:00:48.890> putting

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
the first experiment is with putting

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.970 
the first experiment is with putting
soap<00:00:49.790> in<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.059> microwave<00:00:50.450> with<00:00:51.079> ages<00:00:51.590> eve<00:00:51.800> we

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
soap in the microwave with ages eve we

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.369 
soap in the microwave with ages eve we
can<00:00:52.190> make<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.610> glow<00:00:53.090> lots<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.719> hours<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.230> be

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
can make it glow lots of hours and be

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:04.290 
can make it glow lots of hours and be
lonely<00:00:55.039> massive<00:00:58.270> lights<00:00:59.270> off

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.000 

well<00:01:05.300> well<00:01:05.570> look<00:01:05.870> what<00:01:05.900> we<00:01:06.110> got<00:01:06.230> here<00:01:06.710> you're

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
well well look what we got here you're

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.730 
well well look what we got here you're
the<00:01:07.100> Fantastic<00:01:08.030> Four<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:08.510> species<00:01:09.200> here<00:01:09.440> isn't

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
the Fantastic Four a species here isn't

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.640 
the Fantastic Four a species here isn't
it<00:01:09.830> like<00:01:09.950> an<00:01:10.100> animal<00:01:10.430> doesn't<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:11.000> I<00:01:11.270> think<00:01:11.930> I'm

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
it like an animal doesn't it I think I'm

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.690 
it like an animal doesn't it I think I'm
gonna<00:01:12.920> call<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.630> freight<00:01:18.070> dangerous<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.400> need<00:01:19.670> a

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
gonna call it freight dangerous I need a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.970 
gonna call it freight dangerous I need a
light<00:01:20.000> bulb<00:01:20.330> light<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:21.380> where<00:01:21.650> am<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:21.860> gonna

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
light bulb light but where am I gonna

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.630 
light bulb light but where am I gonna
get<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.220> light<00:01:22.490> bulb<00:01:23.440> aha<00:01:27.100> I've<00:01:28.100> got<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.400> bright

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
get a light bulb aha I've got a bright

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.380 
get a light bulb aha I've got a bright
idea<00:01:30.040> let's<00:01:31.040> put<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.400> bulb<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.260> microwave

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
idea let's put the bulb in the microwave

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.170 
idea let's put the bulb in the microwave
lights<00:01:35.740> now<00:01:36.740> what's<00:01:36.920> happening<00:01:37.400> it's<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.940> gas

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
lights now what's happening it's the gas

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.480 
lights now what's happening it's the gas
inside<00:01:38.570> light<00:01:38.870> bulb<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.470> getting<00:01:40.070> energized

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
inside light bulb is getting energized

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.730 
inside light bulb is getting energized
by<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.910> microwaves<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.960> gets<00:01:42.170> brighter<00:01:42.500> and

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
by the microwaves you gets brighter and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.770 
by the microwaves you gets brighter and
brighter<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.369> also<00:01:43.640> gets<00:01:43.880> hotter<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.450> hotter

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
brighter it also gets hotter and hotter

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.140 
brighter it also gets hotter and hotter
if<00:01:45.530> we're<00:01:45.740> lucky<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.610> might<00:01:46.790> even<00:01:46.970> go<00:01:47.240> bang

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.850 

smashing<00:01:53.150> we're<00:01:53.780> 26<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.150> microwave

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
smashing we're 26 and on the microwave

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.640 
smashing we're 26 and on the microwave
let's<00:01:57.860> go<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.280> make<00:01:58.460> science<00:01:59.030> babies<00:01:59.650> I've

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
let's go and make science babies I've

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.830 
let's go and make science babies I've
got<00:02:00.890> four<00:02:01.190> toothpicks<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.000> put<00:02:02.450> them<00:02:02.570> into<00:02:02.690> a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
got four toothpicks I put them into a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440 
got four toothpicks I put them into a
cork<00:02:03.220> let's<00:02:04.220> light<00:02:04.490> them<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.970> see<00:02:05.270> what

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
cork let's light them and see what

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.220 
cork let's light them and see what
happens

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:21.449 

oh<00:02:18.299> come<00:02:19.299> on<00:02:19.360> burn<00:02:19.780> baby<00:02:20.200> burn<00:02:20.459> toothpick

X is the microwaves and why and that's
why<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.640> get<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.819> doctor<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.329> pull<00:02:43.599> it

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
why you have to get a doctor to pull it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.130 
why you have to get a doctor to pull it
out<00:02:43.870> again<00:02:45.090> that's<00:02:46.090> all<00:02:46.299> we've<00:02:46.450> got<00:02:46.480> time<00:02:46.599> for
