00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.240
 nintendo 310 xl edition of zelda a link 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.670
 between words 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.849
 Well let's see what the box is 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.340
 while I tell them that I click this 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.130
 edition and it will come out in black friday 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.950
 in my mistake I realized that in 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.590
 facebook on Friday all the people 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.080
 started posting that they already had that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.960
 console in your hands which I stayed 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.870
 christina as I was never her away not 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.540
 I knew nothing about this at the moment and that 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.730
 I got too scared but I got good 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:52.230
 get and let's see what it contains 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.440
 this is a different video on my cell 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.750
 nothing exotic but good the intention is 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.390
 what counts then let's open it 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.370
 for this part of here as 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.670
 the more I have a knife hand is 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.400
 extremely your mom I will have it 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.550
 lower the camera and cut a few two 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.670
 good sides it was difficult to cut these 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.670
 waves using your hands 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 over here because this part has 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.399
 this tab 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.890
 in the other part as they do not have it 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:32.080
 of sport so 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.080
 well, I think we do better here 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.590
 like this 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.890
 it has to be 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.429
 not because both hands have to be 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.219
 wait until then and it's a bit 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.200
 hard maybe if I'm well pulled 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.810
 the left hand of the technologist or for 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.860

 even in the most rooms 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.569
