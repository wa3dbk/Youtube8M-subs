 hi girls, I hope you had a 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.590
 fabulous week today I am going to show you 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.440
 how to make a nail design that is 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.690
 super chic very fashion that serves us 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.940
 for any occasion 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.570
 we start applying base in all 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 our nails 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 and as base colors we are going to apply 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.790
 red color first in these three ones and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.310
 a cream or beige color in the other two 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.820
 let's make the burberry design in 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.530
 the nails that we painted cream color 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.890
 then with the white enamel first 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 let's make a vertical line towards 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.140
 one side of the nail 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.579
 and now let's make a line 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 horizontal that fits like a cross 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 If it does not fit perfectly, there's no problem 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.670
 we can arrange the small details 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.670
 with a thin brush 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.960
 next with the color black and with 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.750
 a thin tip brush we are going to make 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.429
 a line on the edge the white color 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.259
 another in the middle and another in the other edge 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.409
 and then we do the same 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.899
 horizontally let's make a line 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.619
 black on each of the edges of the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.619
 white color and then one in the middle 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.900
 and for the finishing touch characterizes 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.010
 burberry let's make a red line to 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 one side of the nail and the other 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.080
 horizontally on top 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.690
 then we do exactly the same 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.030
 steps in the other nail that we apply the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.000
 cream 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.070
 finally we apply one or two layers 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 of brightness so that our design that 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.929
 perfect 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 and this is finally the result you see 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.750
 super cute and we will be very good 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.680
 both with elegant clothes and with a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.680
 casual outfit 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.760
