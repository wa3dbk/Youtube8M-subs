all right what I got here is a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.330 
all right what I got here is a
bombardier<00:00:03.890> it's<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.040> CD<00:00:05.430> 97<00:00:06.390> GS<00:00:07.099> I'm<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.280> to

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
bombardier it's a CD 97 GS I'm going to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580 
bombardier it's a CD 97 GS I'm going to
show<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.519> where<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> find<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.719> rectifier

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
show you where to find the rectifier

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.370 
show you where to find the rectifier
regulator<00:00:11.309> I've<00:00:11.880> had<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> hard<00:00:12.929> time<00:00:13.170> finding

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
regulator I've had a hard time finding

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.450 
regulator I've had a hard time finding
this<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:15.529> couldn't<00:00:16.529> find<00:00:16.650> any<00:00:16.830> videos<00:00:17.250> on

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
this and couldn't find any videos on

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
YouTube to show where the location is so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.240 
YouTube to show where the location is so
today<00:00:21.960> I'm<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.859> where<00:00:23.130> it's

today I'm going to show you where it's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.759 
today I'm going to show you where it's
at<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:24.230> looked<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.590> originally<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.760> I

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
at I looked in here originally and I

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
at I looked in here originally and I
pulled<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.949> electrical<00:00:32.550> box<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:33.000> thinking

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
pulled this electrical box out thinking

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.660 
pulled this electrical box out thinking
it<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.380> there<00:00:34.620> well<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.630> not<00:00:36.630> works<00:00:36.870> at

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
it was in there well that's not works at

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
it was in there well that's not works at

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the front of the hood here take this box

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.180 
the front of the hood here take this box
out<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:54.320> sorry<00:00:55.320> I'm<00:00:55.410> try<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
out and you look down sorry I'm try to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.260 
out and you look down sorry I'm try to
get<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> where<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:59.270> alright

get this where you can see it alright
you<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.320> be

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you see this right here this would be

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.039 
you see this right here this would be
your<00:01:04.760> rectifier<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.330> how<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> bolt

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
your rectifier right here how to bolt

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
your rectifier right here how to bolt
out<00:01:07.229> already<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.000> folded<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.540> here

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
out already but it was folded right here

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
out already but it was folded right here
and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.860> plugs<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:13.310> just<00:01:14.310> undo

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and it plugs in right there so just undo

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
and it plugs in right there so just undo
this<00:01:15.030> clip<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:17.030> pull<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> there's

this clip here pull it out and there's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
this clip here pull it out and there's
your<00:01:22.320> rectifier<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.250> spent<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.700> lot

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
your rectifier so it was I spent a lot

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
your rectifier so it was I spent a lot
of<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.180> trying<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> look<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.049> thing<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
of time trying to look for this thing it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.719 
of time trying to look for this thing it
was<00:01:29.009> getting<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.460> aggravating<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
was getting really aggravating and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.060
