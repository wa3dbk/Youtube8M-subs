00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 what that means an optical 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.439
 delusion if you are here in the studio now 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 They have to sit on the best 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.180
 Watch screens because you can only 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
 from a certain perspective right 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.180

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 audience at home here is a yes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.120
 What is that pillar? 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 there she stands yes I'll go for a while 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.570
 so the pillar so here is a pillar 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.039
 then right next to me in the studio laughing 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.289
 The people at home say why laugh 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.280
 the sun is standing exactly 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 beside him 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.800
 So now I'm going to the sun 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.390
 on it a bit on the back of the thing then 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.699
 Can I jump on it better? 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.699
 I'm a bit higher up here so beware 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.020
 and high and high esteem 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.770
 Dusseldorf 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.450
 the head end is yes I am exactly so 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.270
 so right now that I am now 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.040
 maybe 40 centimeters yes I'll give it 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 now back and then I do not 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.520
 it suddenly turns big again 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 so do not let that happen again 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.780
 big and now I go on it yes 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.240
 even though I'm hardly on TV 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.180
 the size sure once totally small 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.820
 Is not it crazy you should go down 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.390
 jump or I'll let me see 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.340
 me off yes maybe it is better too 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 is dangerous is quite pretty deep 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:37.389
 is really deep who had so much 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.389
 I'm looking forward to the page 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.940
 these are here today the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.700
 crazy or the eye just plays 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.750
 not even funnier it is if 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.140
 I stand here in front and there is behind 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.140
 so here is our participation kassandra 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.030
 best to get yes now go 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.859
 here behind it would have to jump on it 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.959
 because it's high now this piece after 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.290
 The front is just too often that she 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.780
 just stay that way come now 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.799
 I'll stand here next to the pillar or see 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.650
 she directly kassandra is much smaller 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.730
 as previously thought or kassandra 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.319
 The voice has also changed completely 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:50.560
 Otherwise, say something of the size 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.609
 correspond or cassandra how old are 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.060
 they came here 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:58.569
 24 came from cologne probably what makes you me 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.359
 work at the doctor but we are making the same 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.669
 a good topic for them, we exchange time 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.480
 just come down again, well 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.889
 well so now they look times in so found 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.079
 then just exactly take the pillar 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.519
 and there you see, I'm a lot 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.230
 smaller than they thought they come 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.230
 forward exactly there 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.840
 great or is not it crazy you 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.590
 But you have to look at the side points 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.449
 now backwards 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.550
 in reality, the television viewer 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.590
 It just looks like I'm standing next to them 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.449
 i am standing next to you kasan 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.319
 was when she looks back 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.180
 that he does not make sense 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.090
 you do not have to look at them you have to 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:46.759
 hello kassandra hello 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.870
 stefan sense as since a blessing that 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.159
 they do not see each other crazy 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.849
 because they are not here at all 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.849
 same time with me please 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.360
 Martin back well no matter thank you 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.360
 first time 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.040
 that sounds football stadium this one 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.780
 things on the bottom of the tossenser 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.040
 saxophonist you can come down times 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.350
 one should play in solo on that 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.590
 careless whisper and I can do it then 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.759
 here so that should be lifted 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.380
 I find it totally fascinating we have 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.000
 and you want is always apart 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.289
 get and you do not get out 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.850
 but they only get apart if 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.990
 they are here in our studio when they are 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.389
 at home are not getting 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.460
 apart so thorsten but thorsten 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.460
 no applause torsten albig 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:53.129
 that are flexible but had to first he when 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:54.539
 the pillar is standing or if he is next to it 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.209
 Finally, always step aside 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.569
 she is just totally normal big 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.559

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.409
 not much smaller than now goes times 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.330
 He even stays on the side 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.309
 not on the thing so exactly 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.659

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:13.649

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 Yes 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.650
 how big the thorsten really is for that 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.759
 she just does not feel like she is not 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.060
 bigger than the saxony before ours 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.310
 is about the same size as this 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.129
 growth and is even a little 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:07.669
 a little bit bigger yes i'm more like that 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:07.669
 Many Thanks 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.790

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.800
 it is 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.410
 it is nothing new but it is 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.690
 nevertheless so plastic and great 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.350
 I have not got anywhere yet explained 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.460
 except just here at tv totally yes then 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.500
 is for example very small 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.199
 the things that are there village that 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.550
 is really yes that is someone will get 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:40.960
 just is not that apart 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.790
 just a plaster and also the brain 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.190
 tried what is known to make out 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:48.669
 that can be kept that's really 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.520
 total hard that even looks good because here 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:52.570
 is bound to a large hole that was in 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.120
 Moscow 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:58.710
 You have to pay attention to that 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.710
 has the point of view
