 this ducati 848 year 2009 2009 2009 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.050
 according to the owner of this motorcycle 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.740
 the bike was acquired on brutal and motorcycles 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.820
 SÃ£o Paulo, with 6 thousand kilometers and 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.840
 I've been with her since then I'm with her. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:37.590
 A year and a half ago - bike never crashed all over 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.629
 original fairing from it 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.809
 never had any kind of now and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 I've never been painted or anything 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.809
 The only thing I did was paint the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.600
 wheels when I bought it 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.600
 but in terms of paint kit they have nothing 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.879
 for the originals has never been 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 no electric part was disassembled 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.400
 also the problem has never been stirred has 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.520
 tracker only bikes the ray but it was not 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:21.119
 made no cut in the original wiring 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.610
 the super thigh tires are with the 1,500 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.020
 kilometers more or less 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.360
 the tip is original what is a drawing 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 finished in the then but is original and has 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.079
 a son had highness imported from 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.079
 a sporty 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.160
 the candle has been touched recently filter here 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.960
 and neither oil order filter kn then 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.940
 was made the exchange of the brake fluid was 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.690
 clutch is also suspension oil 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.690
 was changed 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.020
 thing about three weeks ago and 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.410
 was also made the exchange of the kit is of the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.580
 system belts with two sets 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:17.200
 has some evening gauntlet accessories was 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:19.600
 the trip and arrows also because it has the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.240
 originals stored behind led and I 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.930
 I put a thermal blanket to 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.640
 the heat in the summer exhaust there 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.910
 enough so it only helps to reduce the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.910
 heat 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.190
 basically this is a call in the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.190
 moto 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 i
