00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.739
 two 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.460
 but 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.340
 with the one dollar coin 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.660
 4 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:31.449
 in those seconds it can also be 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.760
 this as a single chime depend on 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.250
 the speed in the previous smooth julia 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.870
 29 seconds so look, he did a lot 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.480
 faster this guy who has now is 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.030
 that's why the consequence is now the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.790
 team lost attention 28 seconds yes 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.879
 have time for this let's see it 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.239
 red complain I like going to see 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.239
 something like that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.980
 we're 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 854 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 and still nothing still does not celebrate me 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 how to review the video because the team 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.970
 Red noticed something and eyes noticed it 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 answered the competition so it's worth 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.439
 it's worth having that benefit to the doubt 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.340
 there are the competitors in favor we are going to 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.000
 repeat videos 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.710
 these things happen let's see I have 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.810
 true the spirit of the first 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.050
 season here keep growing too 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.750
 doing 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.880
 Toño's face april per second because 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 your vélez was about to equal what is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 crazy that law will be 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.640
 in the images that happened here we are 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 what do they say Julian does not touch 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 the hand on the last in the last dam 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.020
 the handkerchief and he takes it very well 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.320
 let's see now 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.200
 let's see a story all the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.959
 attention is coming 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.959
 all the handkerchief and does not touch 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.720
 but in the second one in the second one 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.200
 the time ends in the second one is over 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.870
 the time that's why he does not touch 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.610
 the first is the complaint the second 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.440
 we play because time is running out and there 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.060
 it's a matter of distance before arriving 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.680
 to the final part exactly 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.760
 we are seeing again the first 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.740
 because we have to see what happened with 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.410
 view 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.500
 if we stay watching julián who plays 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.930
 let's see if saying as 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.650
 he does it correctly very well up there 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.900
 we do not have any good problem that you 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.530
 knife does not cut 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.130
 here is the end of time is going to end 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.430
 the time why we keep 21 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.670
 a time and that was basically the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.740
 distance does not matter if you do not touch 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.380
 He also remembers that I do not touch him because he does not 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.020
 there is because distance says something else 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.500
 so the time had already ended like this 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.500
 of simple 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.459
 in the house held 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 to the yellows
