00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 a lizard from 23 million ago 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.890
 years a fossilized lizard that was 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.830
 Found in a piece of amber from Chiapas 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.230
 of an age of 23 million years 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 is exhibited in the fossil museum in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.930
 amber hidden stone located in san 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.850
 cristóbal de las casas in chiapas mexico 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.730
 the reptile is considered the largest 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.279
 of the world found in an amber iván 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.680
 milan and curator and responsible designer 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.539
 from the museum of fossils in amber said that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 in the month of March of this year a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 provider of the tenth youth municipality les 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.710
 He came to sell a piece of red amber 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.750
 that contained a lizard the lord 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 he realized the piece was 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 being able then he interrupted his process 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.700
 to bring her because she considers us 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.920
 experts and obviously it was bought then 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 of a detailed work by the curator Ivan 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.510
 milan and the lizard was showing up 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.660
 little by little since he was in a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 difficult place to polish the reptile measures 10 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.219
 centimeters long is almost complete 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.350
 and you can see it for free in the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.300
 fossil museum in amber owned by 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 elizabeth gálvez cruz 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.120
 It is located on Avenida 20 de 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 November 22 ecclesiastical walker the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.990
 curator explained some of the problems 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.510
 what did he have for that crocodile 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.300
 as he was baptized he could be seen with 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.280
 greater clarity the problem was that of a 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.680
 side the lizard stuck almost in the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 surface just where is the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.750
 red and the other side if it cleared 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.970
 easily but it was very deep 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.470
 then the depth did not allow the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.580
 normal view and did not allow the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.400
 classification 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.620
 I made a stepped cut to avoid losing 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.250
 the moths and other species that are 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.010
 in the same piece apart from all the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 piece has something very peculiar the tail is 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.540
 he lost not because of a bad cut but 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.490
 come back to the piece very curious 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.100
 take into account that sometimes 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.960
 lizards especially if they are persecuted 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.330
 by predators lose the tail 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.570
 while this lizard was caught 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.140
 almost complete noted that the owner 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.630
 from the museum 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.450
 elisabeth gálvez cruz has other 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.459
 lizards but they are small there are about 30 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.170
 in total in the world but it is for the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.310
 information that we have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.500
 the largest of all are usually measured 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 34 maximum 6 centimeters 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.110
 here we are talking about a lizard 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.300
 10 centimeters the museum biologist 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.880
 of paleontology of tuxtla gutiérrez 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.100
 gerardo carbon studies the part 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.459
 anatomical reptile what are the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.560
 legs the tail the mouthpiece all the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.930
 elements that at a given moment are going to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 serve with more microscopic photos for 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.150
 define the order the family and the species 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.459
 He stressed that this finding is very 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.950
 important because it tells us what the 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.380
 ecosystem but it also tells us that the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.959
 Amber Chiapaneco has very rare pieces 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.360
 it is known as a gem beyond 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.489
 have a fossil inside and tell us 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.549
 a very important message that there is a 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.100
 material to be able to work but also 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.470
 the fossil museum in amber has 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.350
 a frog that was found in simojovel and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.480
 It has been exhibited for a year 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.900
 there are only three or four frogs in the world 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.700
 and this is the best preserved added 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.069
 to get an idea of the importance of 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.989
 this fán Ivan Ivan indicates that 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.030
 the national geographic portal the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.400
 photograph of the amphibian found in a 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.090
 Amber is among the 10 most images 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.849
 views in total the fossil museum in 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.280
 amber has 10,000 pieces 2,000 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.560
 them on display where apart from the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.359
 lizard and frog people can 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.170
 see the ants for free 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.650
 mosquitoes butterflies bedbugs moths 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.230
 spiders crickets and even cockroaches 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:53.840
 fossilized inside pieces of amber 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.840
 greet them fixed finger until the next
