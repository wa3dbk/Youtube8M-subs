 A little 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.280
 The inside feels like this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.420
 It's a Maeda 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.360

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.750
 It is characteristic 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.450
 I think it's a skill 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:18.290

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.850
 In this 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.250
 A brochure with a guarantee certificate and a light statement on the stone 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.590

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:09.830

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:15.290
