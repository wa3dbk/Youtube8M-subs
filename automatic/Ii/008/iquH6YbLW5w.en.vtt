00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
the theory side of things so like the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
the theory side of things so like the
benefit<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.650> taking<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.340> stuff<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.670> that

jungle that means that amid the game and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
jungle you now have an extra can to take

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
away so that you at least have something

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.750 
away so that you at least have something
to<00:00:45.510> farm<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:46.739> happening<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.579> there

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to farm when that's happening now there

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.190 
to farm when that's happening now there
is<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> misconception<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is a bit of a misconception here just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
is a bit of a misconception here just
because<00:00:49.320> there's<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.739> extra<00:00:50.129> camp<00:00:50.460> doesn't

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because there's an extra camp doesn't

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
because there's an extra camp doesn't
mean<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> jungler<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.530> extra

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
mean that the jungler now has an extra

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
mean that the jungler now has an extra
camps<00:00:53.219> worth<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.670> gold<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.780> doesn't

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
camps worth of gold that really doesn't

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
camps worth of gold that really doesn't

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.569 
the two biggest points as far as a
theory<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.320> white<00:01:37.530> camp<00:01:37.770> goes<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
theory side of white camp goes and I

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.130 
theory side of white camp goes and I
just<00:01:38.700> want<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> talk<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.630> detail

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
just want to talk a bit about the detail

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.539 
just want to talk a bit about the detail
of<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.009> taking<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> away

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
of when you want to be taking it away

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
of when you want to be taking it away
now<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.240> opinion<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> white<00:01:42.869> camp<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now my opinion the white camp is the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.200 
now my opinion the white camp is the
hardest<00:01:43.829> jungle<00:01:44.159> camp<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> taken

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
hardest jungle camp for you to be taken

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.420 
hardest jungle camp for you to be taken
away<00:01:45.299> especially<00:01:45.750> early<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.220> game

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
away especially early on into the game

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
away especially early on into the game
the<00:01:48.030> bees<00:01:48.180> reason<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.780> feel<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the bees reason for this I feel is that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
the bees reason for this I feel is that
because<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> single<00:01:50.790> creature<00:01:51.299> camp

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because it is a single creature camp

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
because it is a single creature camp
that<00:01:51.990> means<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.409> no<00:01:52.560> mini<00:01:53.159> minions

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that means there are no mini minions

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
that means there are no mini minions
around<00:01:53.970> surrounding<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> has<00:01:54.869> no<00:01:55.079> friends

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
around surrounding it has no friends

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
around surrounding it has no friends
that<00:01:56.070> means<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> hundred<00:01:56.790> percent<00:01:57.210> at

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that means that for a hundred percent at

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.789 
that means that for a hundred percent at
a<00:01:57.479> time<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.869> taking<00:01:58.259> away<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.590> white

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
a time you are taking away that white

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.459 
a time you are taking away that white
camp<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> big<00:02:00.210> dude<00:02:00.540> beating<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
camp you have a big dude beating the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.469 
camp you have a big dude beating the
crap<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> other<00:02:03.030> camps

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
crap out of you with all the other camps

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.389 
crap out of you with all the other camps
you<00:02:03.899> are<00:02:03.990> kidding<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.409> big<00:02:04.649> dude<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.219> once

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you are kidding a big dude but then once

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.819 
you are kidding a big dude but then once
that<00:02:05.549> guy<00:02:05.850> has<00:02:06.030> died<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.899> only<00:02:07.049> many<00:02:07.439> people

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that guy has died it's only many people

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.350 
that guy has died it's only many people
left<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.700> hurt<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.179> that

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
left and they don't really hurt you that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
left and they don't really hurt you that
much<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.259> most<00:02:10.379> junglers<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.009> means

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
much so for most junglers this means

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.420 
much so for most junglers this means
that<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> white<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.849> becomes<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> bit

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
that the white can becomes a bit

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.550 
that the white can becomes a bit
a<00:02:12.459> DPS<00:02:13.030> rates<00:02:13.359> to<00:02:13.569> kill<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.870> as<00:02:13.959> fast<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.439> you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
a DPS rates to kill it as fast as you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.530 
a DPS rates to kill it as fast as you
can<00:02:14.799> before<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.310> does<00:02:15.459> too<00:02:15.790> much<00:02:15.969> damage<00:02:16.239> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
can before it does too much damage to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
can before it does too much damage to
you<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.109> when<00:02:17.409> should<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.709> attempt<00:02:18.129> this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
you so when should you attempt this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.130 
you so when should you attempt this
white<00:02:18.519> camp<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.939> when<00:02:19.060> should<00:02:19.299> you<00:02:19.359> avoid<00:02:19.659> it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
white camp and when should you avoid it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.479 
white camp and when should you avoid it
the<00:02:20.319> first<00:02:20.530> biggest<00:02:20.859> point<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.219> if<00:02:21.370> your

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the first biggest point is if your

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.670 
the first biggest point is if your
champion<00:02:21.969> would<00:02:22.180> have<00:02:22.390> high<00:02:22.719> single<00:02:23.260> target

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
champion would have high single target

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.470 
champion would have high single target
damage<00:02:23.829> if<00:02:24.219> that's<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.790> case<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.239> most

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
damage if that's the case then most

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.940 
damage if that's the case then most
likely<00:02:25.629> they'll<00:02:25.989> be<00:02:26.140> good<00:02:26.319> at<00:02:26.469> taking<00:02:26.650> away

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
likely they'll be good at taking away

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
likely they'll be good at taking away
the<00:02:27.099> white<00:02:27.310> camp<00:02:27.579> because<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.120> say<00:02:28.359> there

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
the white camp because like I say there

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.539 
the white camp because like I say there
are<00:02:28.989> no<00:02:29.139> other<00:02:29.349> minions<00:02:29.650> around<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.370> any

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
are no other minions around it so any

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.550 
are no other minions around it so any
kind<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.879> AoE<00:02:31.150> abilities<00:02:31.329> you<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:31.840> really

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
kind of AoE abilities you have really

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.020 
kind of AoE abilities you have really
don't<00:02:33.099> help<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.430> too<00:02:33.579> much<00:02:33.760> when<00:02:33.939> you're

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
don't help you too much when you're

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
don't help you too much when you're
fighting<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:34.810> does<00:02:35.019> also<00:02:35.230> include

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
fighting it and this does also include

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.589 
fighting it and this does also include
your<00:02:35.859> smite<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.519> would<00:02:36.730> always<00:02:37.150> say<00:02:37.389> it

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
your smite so I would always say it

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.959 
your smite so I would always say it
especially<00:02:38.049> early<00:02:38.530> on<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.099> game<00:02:39.310> never

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
especially early on is the game never

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.459 
especially early on is the game never
attempt<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.540> take<00:02:40.719> away<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.019> white<00:02:41.200> camp

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
attempt to take away the white camp

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.619 
attempt to take away the white camp
unless<00:02:41.950> you're<00:02:42.280> smart<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.329> just<00:02:43.510> for

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
unless you're smart is up so just for

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.210 
unless you're smart is up so just for
some<00:02:43.780> example<00:02:44.260> champions<00:02:44.680> who<00:02:44.799> would<00:02:44.919> be<00:02:45.010> good

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
some example champions who would be good

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.890 
some example champions who would be good
at<00:02:45.370> taking<00:02:45.549> away<00:02:45.819> why<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.060> would<00:02:46.450> say<00:02:46.629> people

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
at taking away why I would say people

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.190 
at taking away why I would say people
like<00:02:47.109> lease<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.650> jax<00:02:48.400> rengar<00:02:49.000> GP<00:02:49.659> or<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:49.959> lease

like lease in jax rengar GP or a lease
any<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.680> those<00:02:50.769> champions<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.970> as<00:02:52.060> examples

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
any of those champions just as examples

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.879 
any of those champions just as examples
are<00:02:52.810> very<00:02:53.049> good<00:02:53.200> at<00:02:53.290> taking<00:02:53.439> away<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.769> white

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
are very good at taking away the white

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.259 
are very good at taking away the white
can<00:02:54.099> because<00:02:54.370> they're<00:02:54.549> single<00:02:54.879> target<00:02:55.180> damage

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
can because they're single target damage

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.330 
can because they're single target damage
is<00:02:55.599> pretty<00:02:55.959> high<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.620> second<00:02:56.950> thing<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.219> take

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is pretty high the second thing to take

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.069 
is pretty high the second thing to take
into<00:02:57.400> consideration<00:02:58.359> when<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:58.629> going<00:02:58.810> for

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
into consideration when you're going for

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.690 
into consideration when you're going for
the<00:02:59.139> white<00:02:59.349> camp<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.739> if<00:02:59.919> your<00:03:00.069> champion<00:03:00.489> has

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
the white camp is if your champion has

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.819 
the white camp is if your champion has
percentage<00:03:01.450> health<00:03:01.780> damage<00:03:02.049> now<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.620> i<00:03:02.680> send

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
percentage health damage now if i send

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.259 
percentage health damage now if i send
yourself<00:03:02.950> damage<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.579> pretty<00:03:03.760> big<00:03:04.120> for

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
yourself damage is pretty big for

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.970 
yourself damage is pretty big for
junglers<00:03:04.629> in<00:03:04.780> general<00:03:05.139> those<00:03:05.379> that<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.829> it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
junglers in general those that have it

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.770 
junglers in general those that have it
usually<00:03:06.340> clear<00:03:06.609> extremely<00:03:07.180> quickly<00:03:07.480> in

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
usually clear extremely quickly in

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.360 
usually clear extremely quickly in
general<00:03:08.230> because<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.739> lot<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.159> jungle

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
general because a lot of the jungle

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.490 
general because a lot of the jungle
creeps<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.939> huge<00:03:10.450> amounts<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:11.019> health<00:03:11.319> and

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
creeps have huge amounts of health and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.009 
creeps have huge amounts of health and
the<00:03:11.859> white<00:03:12.069> camp<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.489> no<00:03:12.700> exception<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.659> idea

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the white camp is no exception the idea

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.360 
the white camp is no exception the idea
of<00:03:14.109> percentage<00:03:14.500> health<00:03:14.680> damage<00:03:14.889> is<00:03:15.129> really

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
of percentage health damage is really

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.860 
of percentage health damage is really
quite<00:03:15.549> simple<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.030> more<00:03:16.299> health<00:03:16.510> something

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
quite simple the more health something

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.080 
quite simple the more health something
has<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.709> more<00:03:17.859> damage<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.459> do<00:03:18.669> to<00:03:18.699> it<00:03:18.879> and

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
has and the more damage you do to it and

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.759 
has and the more damage you do to it and
again<00:03:19.599> because<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.109> white<00:03:20.290> camp<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.739> a

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
again because the white camp is a

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.399 
again because the white camp is a
solitary<00:03:21.220> creature<00:03:21.729> it<00:03:22.090> has<00:03:22.419> huge<00:03:22.989> amounts<00:03:23.349> of

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
solitary creature it has huge amounts of

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.170 
solitary creature it has huge amounts of
health<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.159> people<00:03:24.459> who<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:25.000> this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
health so people who have this

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.640 
health so people who have this
percentage<00:03:25.629> health<00:03:25.840> damage<00:03:26.019> like<00:03:26.349> Elise

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
percentage health damage like Elise

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.670 
percentage health damage like Elise
Monrovia<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.699> Kazakhs<00:03:28.449> are<00:03:28.479> all<00:03:28.989> very<00:03:29.560> good

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
Monrovia and Kazakhs are all very good

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.800 
Monrovia and Kazakhs are all very good
at<00:03:30.129> taking<00:03:30.400> away<00:03:30.699> the<00:03:30.819> white<00:03:31.030> camp<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.540> my

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
at taking away the white camp and my

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.629 
at taking away the white camp and my
final<00:03:32.079> point<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.769> advice<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.340> I'd<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:33.579> to

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
final point of advice that I'd like to

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.309 
final point of advice that I'd like to
give<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.030> about<00:03:34.269> taking<00:03:34.659> away<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.900> white<00:03:35.109> is

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
give you about taking away the white is

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.289 
give you about taking away the white is
that<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:36.189> don't<00:03:36.400> recommend<00:03:36.669> doing<00:03:37.030> it

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
that I really don't recommend doing it

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.270 
that I really don't recommend doing it
early<00:03:37.870> on<00:03:37.900> into<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.530> game<00:03:38.709> there<00:03:38.919> are<00:03:39.010> very

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
early on into the game there are very

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.429 
early on into the game there are very
very<00:03:39.370> few<00:03:39.879> examples<00:03:40.659> of<00:03:40.780> where<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.019> would<00:03:41.229> say

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
very few examples of where I would say

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.050 
very few examples of where I would say
that<00:03:41.470> it's<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.829> good<00:03:42.069> idea<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.459> be<00:03:42.669> taking<00:03:43.030> it

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
that it's a good idea to be taking it

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.479 
that it's a good idea to be taking it
away<00:03:43.209> over<00:03:44.169> a<00:03:44.199> different<00:03:44.500> camp<00:03:44.949> i<00:03:45.129> would<00:03:45.340> say

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
away over a different camp i would say

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.789 
away over a different camp i would say
99<00:03:45.849> times<00:03:46.239> out<00:03:46.449> of<00:03:46.509> 100<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.169> is<00:03:47.290> much<00:03:47.530> better

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
99 times out of 100 it is much better

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.039 
99 times out of 100 it is much better
idea<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.430> take<00:03:48.639> away<00:03:48.879> the<00:03:49.000> walls<00:03:49.299> as<00:03:49.689> opposed

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
idea to take away the walls as opposed

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.569 
idea to take away the walls as opposed
to<00:03:50.199> the<00:03:50.290> white<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:50.769> you<00:03:50.919> have<00:03:51.129> that<00:03:51.280> choice

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
to the white if you have that choice

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.819 
to the white if you have that choice
once<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.299> champion<00:03:52.659> get<00:03:52.810> some<00:03:53.019> levels<00:03:53.439> and<00:03:53.680> you

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
once a champion get some levels and you

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.439 
once a champion get some levels and you
get<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.069> bit<00:03:54.220> into<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.609> game<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.269> can

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
get a bit into the game and you can

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.270 
get a bit into the game and you can
improve<00:03:55.959> your<00:03:56.019> clear<00:03:56.500> speed<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.040> you're<00:03:57.129> not

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
improve your clear speed and you're not

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.550 
improve your clear speed and you're not
really<00:03:57.549> fragile<00:03:57.939> and<00:03:58.329> weak<00:03:58.389> with<00:03:58.840> no<00:03:59.049> items

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
really fragile and weak with no items

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.339 
really fragile and weak with no items
then<00:04:00.340> taken<00:04:00.669> away<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.939> y<00:04:01.030> camp<00:04:01.299> isn't<00:04:01.509> too

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
then taken away the y camp isn't too

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.349 
then taken away the y camp isn't too
hard<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.250> that's<00:04:03.430> basically<00:04:03.549> all<00:04:03.849> i<00:04:03.970> want<00:04:04.299> to
