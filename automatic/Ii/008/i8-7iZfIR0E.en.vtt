pretty good year this year in la liga
but<00:00:35.820> i<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.120> don't<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> major<00:00:36.660> upgrade

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
but i really don't see a major upgrade

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
but i really don't see a major upgrade
coming<00:00:37.410> for<00:00:37.590> him<00:00:37.680> 11<00:00:38.280> goals<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.730> 11<00:00:38.790> assists

coming for him 11 goals and 11 assists

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.639 
coming for him 11 goals and 11 assists
in<00:00:39.420> total<00:00:39.719> eight<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> those<00:00:40.110> coming<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> La

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
in total eight of those coming in La

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.340 
in total eight of those coming in La
Liga<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> nine<00:00:41.610> assists<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.170> he's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
Liga and nine assists as well so he's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
Liga and nine assists as well so he's
going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> big<00:00:43.950> key<00:00:44.190> part<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> Barcelona

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
going to be a big key part of Barcelona

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.100 
going to be a big key part of Barcelona
now<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.510> he's<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.899> playing

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
now because he's going to be playing

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
now because he's going to be playing
alongside<00:00:46.530> Neymar<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.489> messy<00:00:47.969> hopefully<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
alongside Neymar and messy hopefully and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
alongside Neymar and messy hopefully and
that<00:00:48.620> attacks<00:00:49.620> should<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.010> absolutely

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that attacks should just be absolutely

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.010 
that attacks should just be absolutely
deadly<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.300> he<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.570> might

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
deadly so I think he actually might

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
deadly so I think he actually might
benefit<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.530> Neymar<00:00:53.010> messy<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:53.460> all

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
benefit from Neymar messy because all

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
benefit from Neymar messy because all
the<00:00:53.760> folks<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.809> he'll<00:00:55.230> be

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the folks gonna be on them and he'll be

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
the folks gonna be on them and he'll be
wide<00:00:55.500> open<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> field<00:00:56.190> probably<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
wide open on the field probably so I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.340 
wide open on the field probably so I
think<00:00:57.390> he's<00:00:57.600> gonna<00:00:57.719> probably<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> good

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
think he's gonna probably have a good

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
think he's gonna probably have a good
year<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.530> 85<00:00:59.399> s<00:00:59.520> where<00:00:59.670> he's<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> be

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
have the player that you probably could

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.490 
have the player that you probably could
have<00:02:59.970> guessed<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.510> Ari<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.870> Robin<00:03:01.230> staying

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
at an 88 rated overall I don't see him

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.670 
at an 88 rated overall I don't see him
really<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:04.019> up<00:03:04.110> cuz<00:03:04.260> he's<00:03:04.349> getting<00:03:04.590> up

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
really going up cuz he's getting up

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
really going up cuz he's getting up
there<00:03:04.739> in<00:03:04.920> age<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.280> he<00:03:05.700> had<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> good<00:03:06.060> year<00:03:06.239> but

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
there in age and he had a good year but

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.660 
there in age and he had a good year but
it's<00:03:06.569> nothing<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.170> justify<00:03:07.769> him<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.519> an

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
it's nothing to justify him for an

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.729 
it's nothing to justify him for an
upgrade<00:03:08.910> scored<00:03:09.629> 15<00:03:09.989> goals<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.410> had<00:03:10.500> 10

upgrade scored 15 goals and had 10
assists<00:03:11.069> throughout<00:03:11.700> international<00:03:12.510> play

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
assists throughout international play

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.970 
assists throughout international play
Champions<00:03:13.079> League<00:03:13.200> play<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
Champions League play and in the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.100 
Champions League play and in the
Bundesliga<00:03:14.579> in<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.090> Bundesliga<00:03:15.660> at<00:03:15.810> five

goals<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.620> five<00:03:16.950> assists<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.459> it's<00:03:17.579> not<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
goals and five assists so it's not the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.460 
goals and five assists so it's not the
league<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.359> mean<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.810> stats<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.319> we're

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
league I mean the stats that we're

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.229 
league I mean the stats that we're
looking<00:03:19.739> for<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.370> he<00:03:20.430> did<00:03:20.609> score<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:21.030> big

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
looking for but he did score that big

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.690 
looking for but he did score that big
goal<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.540> Bayern<00:03:21.900> Munich<00:03:22.319> in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:23.220> Champions

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
goal for Bayern Munich in the Champions

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.099 
goal for Bayern Munich in the Champions
League<00:03:23.760> final<00:03:24.090> which<00:03:24.359> did<00:03:24.569> help<00:03:24.780> them<00:03:24.930> beat

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
League final which did help them beat

League final which did help them beat
Borussia<00:03:25.620> Dortmund<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.100> do<00:03:26.220> think<00:03:26.519> that

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
Borussia Dortmund so I do think that

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.699 
Borussia Dortmund so I do think that
he's<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.299> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> get<00:03:27.630> downgraded<00:03:27.840> but

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
he's not going to get downgraded but

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.080 
he's not going to get downgraded but
he's<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> be<00:03:29.310> upgraded<00:03:29.519> because<00:03:29.970> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
he's not going to be upgraded because of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.729 
he's not going to be upgraded because of
his<00:03:30.209> age<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.450> well<00:03:30.840> he<00:03:30.989> didn't<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.530> most

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739
