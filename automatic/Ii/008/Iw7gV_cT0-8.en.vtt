00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 I am alfa beta gamma and omega is the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.660
 only advice as gives for mehr apps 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.929
 and stop there right so it's a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.929
 troll 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.920
 hello to you all and Czech da 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.120
 krew i hope you're fine i'll you 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.710
 welcome to this video 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.330
 today I'm in charge of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.989
 you make fun of the delano optimus 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.730
 today we will meet for a 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.420
 hypothesis that we can define good 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.190
 new 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.050
 yeah same unless unless you have 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.460
 nothing to fuck and you do not know call 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.590
 of duty in this case I do not see too much 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.720
 what are you doing either on the new wave or 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.980
 so if you just learned that you are 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.320
 and multimillionaire 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.120
 so that's going to be good news but 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.739
 less important and therefore less 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.870
 cheerful than the one you already had 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.130
 because that's it's multimillionaire and 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.710
 have a beta on code 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.840
 okay so what if it will answer that 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.310
 come back to valeo yes we go there 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.380
 starts live in the play program 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.800
 you have a rage man gameplay 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.200
 venom that will make us a little 117.0 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.800
 just this on the melton app 2 call of 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.110
 Duty Black Ops 2 With Her Ass 94 Her Lot 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.030
 stars and all his hunting group 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.490
 that in less than multi strategic points 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 team so it's a 117.1 I can not wait to 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 see his passes in 17 0 but hey you go 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.790
 not me for the weight a single 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.530
 frag 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.090
 it's still a lot of horatio 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 do not see it every day and then like 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.080
 would say a bald man from 91 a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.910
 pendulum is too big to be 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.229
 shit today's info will you 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.869
 certainly have it in the title 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.880
 a beta scheduled for June for call of 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.380
 duty black ops three water bombs or 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.819
 have had it but I am responsible for 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.110
 you explain it but why do we 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.119
 lets you swing a title like 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.990
 it's waiting wait i 'm going first 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.940
 give you a little date 16 June 2015 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.340
 what is this date the date of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.380
 the 2015 2015 which is a conference 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.670
 international video game that is based 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.770
 in los angeles i think that's the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.690
 first of the year a share not of the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.940
 everything but that's where it's one of the most 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.130
 important or especially the alpha of 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.289
 black ops 3 is going to be represented that's it 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.959
 not a surprise every year there is a 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.580
 alfa who is available to test for them 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.709
 for people who see the 3 2 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.630
 just let's jump on a second 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.040
 date more uncertain this one since 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.060
 it is precisely the one that sets 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.599
 question in this video 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.890
 Basically the beta of black ops 3 kills 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.170
 and the first time besides I'm you 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.030
 remind him that call of duty will do 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.480
 a beta for a game since call of duty 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.250
 4 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 oh well the base the beta was planned for 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.430
 one or two months before the game's release 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.480
 so the exit is in europe so the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.269
 beta was planned 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.340
 september october and the ba voila you 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.709
 but there today why June 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.750
 first this tweet a tweet a metronome 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.000
 who did not understand if the beta was going 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.830
 to be only at conferences or so 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.030
 really at home what will be the case 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.040
 besides, since I remind you 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.110
 every year on every call of duty 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.250
 have always been early versions of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.709
 games available in conferences 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.450
 huh it's just a beta that's going to be 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.640
 broadcast a large audience that did not have 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.140
 been done since min call of duty 4 and 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.209
 so david von of the few 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.590
 one of the directors of treyarch did not 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.290
 not fucking his mouth about during 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.879
 that for the 3 it would be an alfa and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.329
 that a low beta is a beta all 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.010
 simply 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.750
 what is the difference between a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.810
 alfa is a beta an alfa it's a 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.489
 first version of the game and a beta 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.129
 it's a second version of the alfa tu 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.319
 see it's a little more gamescom 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.120
 he denies the facts nicht ie that 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.079
 the gamescom which will take place in August which 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.660
 is another conference 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.609
 she will already host the beta the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.859
 second version since the game will be 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.769
 almost finished in August as he as they 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.150
 say david von der from 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.650
 next it would mean that so the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.709
 first version the alpha would be 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.769
 available June 16, 2015 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.139
 so for the for the 3 the conference and 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.090
 that the beta would be made between the 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.660
 gamescom and the 3 ie between June 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.250
 and August 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.139
 I give you my opinion there quickly 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.239
 on it I think an exit from the beta 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.040
 advance us to be that beneficial 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.230
 simply because the more the beast to 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.849
 go out at rate plus studios makes 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.650
 quickly the reactions of the players and 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.840
 the more they can correct things 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.230
 in for the release of the final game all 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.880
 simply 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.799
 and there you may say but we 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.180
 press based on a tweet to have 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.340
 a date like that plus a date 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.780
 exact on the 21st I do not know if it will be in 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.310
 the title on June 21st 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.660
 yes, but we're not just going on 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.299
 since that's the second part of the 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.010
 video we swing the trailer why 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.450
 the trailer the amber trailer of call of 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.650
 duty black ops 3 because we're going 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.360
 realize that the gaming industry 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.460
 video is completely crazy they have 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.030
 concealed numbers by all 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.680
 ill 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.030
 so it's not me who did the study 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.130
 inverter I did not break the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.289
 search and it's but people here 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.210
 several people have found 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.260
 similarities and they were right here 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.940
 on guard and we 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.110
 i do not know i 'm not going to make nice on 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.670
 the males I have not the sorter under them 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.580
 eyes but I'll put it in the 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.640
 background we see many times 6 21 6 21 6 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.130
 21 e do not if it holds that this is 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.770
 that I tell if so if 6.21 yeah that's 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.660
 well that's so if you go back it's 21 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.070
 6 because in fact in the United States of America 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.100
 debt he lists it the other way through 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.130
 report to us so that would mean 26 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.650
 June logically on June 26, 2000 28 years 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.360
 June 21st party a player that's because 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.890
 the toy is the sixth month we will 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.500
 find the guys do not worry 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.960
 we are not lost June 21 way that 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.210
 would like to say that we find this at 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.610
 several in several places from 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.560
 trailer that could that mean his 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.660
 so be it really they have 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.750
 decided to bet a minimum budget 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.840
 in the trailer for to put the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.030
 same numbers to pay me this will be 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.920
 really your the feq so I think that 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.600
 it's not there by chance and it's 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.770
 volunteer simply to have put 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.470
 this date June 21 is so maybe the 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.630
 release of the beta on June 21 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.010
 we will know more of course in the months 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.660
 to come in any case it was Czech da 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.310
 krew i hope this video still 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.930
 you will have more hypothesis a little bit 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.150
 info a little bit you see a little bit 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.460
 all this with the massacre in the background 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.290
 do not hesitate to congratulate them for 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.910
 its gameplay 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.010
 so get ready for the arrival of 21 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.170
