Liverpool Football Club I've gone around

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.610 
Liverpool Football Club I've gone around
the<00:05:30.090> right<00:05:30.300> way<00:05:30.479> of<00:05:30.750> dealing<00:05:31.080> with<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.440> matter

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
the right way of dealing with the matter

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.440 
the right way of dealing with the matter
in<00:05:31.979> some<00:05:32.250> respects<00:05:32.639> yet<00:05:32.880> they<00:05:33.000> are<00:05:33.150> because

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
in some respects yet they are because

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.060 
in some respects yet they are because
they've<00:05:33.599> gone<00:05:33.810> under<00:05:34.229> supported<00:05:34.860> their

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
they've gone under supported their

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.850 
they've gone under supported their
player<00:05:35.520> which<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.180> think<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:37.560> should

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
player which I think that you should

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.469 
player which I think that you should
support<00:05:38.039> your<00:05:38.370> player<00:05:38.669> but<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.300> way<00:05:39.450> that

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
support your player but in the way that

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.940 
support your player but in the way that
they've<00:05:39.840> supported<00:05:40.169> them<00:05:40.470> I<00:05:40.560> think<00:05:40.800> it's

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
they've supported them I think it's

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.440 
they've supported them I think it's
wrong<00:05:41.130> because<00:05:41.370> it's<00:05:41.669> given<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.150> impression

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
wrong because it's given the impression

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.900 
wrong because it's given the impression
that<00:05:42.900> they're<00:05:43.530> gonna<00:05:43.740> back<00:05:44.039> him<00:05:44.220> when<00:05:44.610> he's<00:05:44.729> in

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
that they're gonna back him when he's in

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.940 
that they're gonna back him when he's in
the<00:05:45.030> wrong<00:05:45.180> what<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:45.840> think<00:05:46.229> Liverpool<00:05:46.740> should

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
the wrong what I think Liverpool should

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.659 
the wrong what I think Liverpool should
be<00:05:47.070> doing<00:05:47.400> is<00:05:47.580> educating<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:49.470> player<00:05:49.770> about

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
be doing is educating the player about

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.170 
be doing is educating the player about
um<00:05:51.270> I<00:05:51.570> I<00:05:51.690> know<00:05:52.349> that<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:52.979> in<00:05:53.280> South<00:05:53.729> America

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.969 
connect with as a black Liverpool
supporter<00:06:24.210> is<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.840> fact<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.229> they're<00:06:25.830> not

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
supporter is the fact that they're not

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.730 
supporter is the fact that they're not
saying<00:06:26.340> we're<00:06:26.760> gonna<00:06:26.910> educate<00:06:27.210> him<00:06:27.720> in<00:06:28.199> the

saying we're gonna educate him in the

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.740 
saying we're gonna educate him in the
fact<00:06:28.979> that<00:06:29.039> they're<00:06:29.280> not<00:06:29.430> denouncing<00:06:30.180> racism

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
fact that they're not denouncing racism

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.120 
fact that they're not denouncing racism
that's<00:06:31.080> a<00:06:31.349> problem<00:06:31.710> for<00:06:31.740> me

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
that's a problem for me

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.440 
that's a problem for me
definitely<00:06:32.610> has<00:06:32.729> to<00:06:32.880> come<00:06:33.030> out<00:06:33.120> and<00:06:33.300> say

definitely has to come out and say
something<00:06:33.900> and<00:06:34.050> I<00:06:34.140> think<00:06:34.200> the<00:06:34.469> club<00:06:34.680> has<00:06:34.800> to

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
something and I think the club has to

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.350 
something and I think the club has to
say<00:06:35.099> something<00:06:35.490> because<00:06:35.610> we<00:06:35.909> are<00:06:36.030> told<00:06:36.240> my
