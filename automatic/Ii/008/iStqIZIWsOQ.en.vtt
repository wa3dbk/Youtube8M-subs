00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.420 
month and then it crumble so this 124
thing<00:01:02.140> i<00:01:02.409> was<00:01:02.949> thinking<00:01:02.979> wow<00:01:03.369> the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
thing i was thinking wow the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.640 
thing i was thinking wow the
compensation<00:01:04.390> plan<00:01:04.420> having<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.080> linear<00:01:05.409> one

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
compensation plan having the linear one

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.340 
compensation plan having the linear one
and<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.580> tree<00:01:06.909> one<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> linear<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.140> like<00:01:08.320> a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
and the tree one so the linear is like a

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.620 
and the tree one so the linear is like a
profit-sharing<00:01:08.830> one<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:10.030> tree<00:01:10.270> one<00:01:10.450> is

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
profit-sharing one and the tree one is

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.660 
profit-sharing one and the tree one is
like<00:01:10.780> your<00:01:10.930> multi-level<00:01:11.229> one<00:01:11.650> was<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.340> really

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
like your multi-level one was a really

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.700 
like your multi-level one was a really
smart<00:01:12.729> idea<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> waiting<00:01:14.020> list<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.679> that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
smart idea and the waiting list so that

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.950 
smart idea and the waiting list so that
people<00:01:15.100> can<00:01:15.219> check<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.579> out<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:16.750> sort<00:01:16.929> of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
people can check it out get sort of

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.719 
people can check it out get sort of
focused<00:01:17.350> on<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.710> without<00:01:17.890> actually<00:01:18.429> having<00:01:18.549> to

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
focused on it without actually having to

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.870 
focused on it without actually having to
commit<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.619> then<00:01:20.649> there<00:01:20.920> was<00:01:20.979> really<00:01:21.460> want<00:01:21.700> to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
commit and then there was really want to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.310 
commit and then there was really want to
get<00:01:22.000> going<00:01:22.329> after<00:01:22.570> they<00:01:22.689> learn<00:01:22.840> about<00:01:23.109> it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
get going after they learn about it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.370 
get going after they learn about it
really<00:01:24.130> good<00:01:24.310> idea<00:01:25.049> slowing<00:01:26.049> everything<00:01:26.259> down

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
really good idea slowing everything down

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.260 
really good idea slowing everything down
so<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.039> don't<00:01:27.100> get<00:01:27.280> big<00:01:27.460> bursts<00:01:27.939> and<00:01:28.119> then

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
so you don't get big bursts and then

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.770 
so you don't get big bursts and then
collapsing<00:01:28.929> really<00:01:29.740> good<00:01:29.890> idea<00:01:30.219> I<00:01:30.939> just<00:01:31.509> think

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
collapsing really good idea I just think

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.719 
collapsing really good idea I just think
that<00:01:31.869> mark<00:01:32.499> seaforth<00:01:32.920> really<00:01:33.369> knows<00:01:33.549> what

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
that mark seaforth really knows what

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.609 
that mark seaforth really knows what
he's<00:01:33.850> doing<00:01:34.179> then<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.020> start<00:01:35.289> taking<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
he's doing then I start taking the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.459 
he's doing then I start taking the
product<00:01:35.920> after<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.939> showed<00:01:37.179> up<00:01:37.390> here<00:01:37.719> and<00:01:37.899> my
