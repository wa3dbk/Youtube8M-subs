00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
our great doctors which is why we're all

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.460 
our great doctors which is why we're all
here<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.490> end<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> day

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.830 

I<00:02:44.550> would<00:02:45.550> say<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.030> worst<00:02:46.540> things<00:02:46.720> like

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
I would say one of the worst things like

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.350 
I would say one of the worst things like
the<00:02:46.900> bark<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.200> course<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.500> probably<00:02:48.360> how

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
the bark of course is probably how

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.150 
the bark of course is probably how
Anatomy<00:02:49.900> was<00:02:50.050> taught<00:02:50.290> when<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> started<00:02:51.010> we

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
Anatomy was taught when I started we

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.980 
Anatomy was taught when I started we
didn't<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.790> option<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.210> do<00:02:52.330> dissection

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
didn't have the option to do dissection

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.450 
didn't have the option to do dissection
which<00:02:53.530> meant<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:53.860> would<00:02:53.920> just<00:02:54.070> go<00:02:54.190> around<00:02:54.280> with

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
which meant we would just go around with

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.120 
which meant we would just go around with
booklets<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.440> pictures<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.560> most<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.860> bodies

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
booklets and pictures of most the bodies

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.650 
booklets and pictures of most the bodies
but<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.430> believe<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.210> last<00:02:58.330> couple<00:02:58.630> of

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
but I believe in the last couple of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.820 
but I believe in the last couple of
years<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:59.020> have<00:02:59.050> managed<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.440> get<00:02:59.530> hold<00:02:59.740> of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
years they have managed to get hold of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.610 
years they have managed to get hold of
more<00:03:00.010> bodies<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.460> you<00:03:00.490> can<00:03:00.820> if<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.060> want<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.620> do

more bodies so you can if you want to do

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.860 
more bodies so you can if you want to do
dissection<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.550> whole<00:03:03.730> body<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.570> help<00:03:04.690> you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
dissection of the whole body to help you

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.540 
dissection of the whole body to help you
appreciate<00:03:05.080> an<00:03:05.650> typical<00:03:06.010> structures<00:03:06.340> better

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
appreciate an typical structures better

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.400 
appreciate an typical structures better
which<00:03:07.210> was<00:03:07.420> something<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.990> didn't<00:03:08.290> have<00:03:08.320> a

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
which was something that I didn't have a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.990 
which was something that I didn't have a
chance<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.680> do<00:03:08.860> which<00:03:09.070> means<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.460> my<00:03:09.580> Anatomy

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
chance to do which means that my Anatomy

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.080 
chance to do which means that my Anatomy
is<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.540> as<00:03:10.630> good<00:03:10.750> as<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.960> should<00:03:10.990> be

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
is not as good as it should be

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.390 
is not as good as it should be
best<00:03:13.900> thing<00:03:14.050> about<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.260> arts<00:03:14.470> course<00:03:14.710> is<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
best thing about the arts course is that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.640 
best thing about the arts course is that
we<00:03:15.490> get<00:03:15.580> patient<00:03:15.910> contact<00:03:16.300> from<00:03:16.540> your<00:03:17.410> first
