00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
but also wetness this formula holds up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760 
but also wetness this formula holds up
all<00:00:44.280> day<00:00:44.640> long<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.330> that's<00:00:45.840> such<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> great

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
thing this formula goes on smoothly

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.730 
thing this formula goes on smoothly
there's<00:00:50.430> no<00:00:50.640> stickiness<00:00:51.240> there's<00:00:51.810> no<00:00:51.990> burning

pull<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.070> my<00:00:56.250> skin<00:00:56.670> none<00:00:57.630> of<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.810> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
pull at my skin none of that this is a

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.000 
pull at my skin none of that this is a
really<00:00:59.280> hydrating<00:01:00.060> and<00:01:00.330> I<00:01:00.720> did<00:01:01.050> try<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
really hydrating and I did try out the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
really hydrating and I did try out the
dove<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.490> sleeveless<00:01:03.060> formula<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> really

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
dove go sleeveless formula and I really

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.919 
dove go sleeveless formula and I really
like<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.890> formula<00:01:05.609> as<00:01:05.759> well<00:01:05.969> I<00:01:06.270> find<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
like that formula as well I find that

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.260 
like that formula as well I find that
this<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.740> bit<00:01:07.859> more<00:01:08.070> hydrating<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this is a little bit more hydrating so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.810 
this is a little bit more hydrating so
this<00:01:09.539> is<00:01:09.719> just<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.170> plus<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.159> haven't

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this is just a plus I haven't

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.919 
this is just a plus I haven't
experienced<00:01:12.420> any<00:01:12.780> dryness<00:01:13.140> irritation<00:01:13.670> or

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
experienced any dryness irritation or

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.469 
experienced any dryness irritation or
darkness<00:01:15.929> on<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.289> skin<00:01:16.890> nothing<00:01:17.609> like<00:01:17.789> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
darkness on my skin nothing like that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.719 
darkness on my skin nothing like that
the<00:01:18.600> consistency<00:01:19.499> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.859> formula<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the consistency of the formula is not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
the consistency of the formula is not
too<00:01:20.999> thick<00:01:21.329> I<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.319> as<00:01:22.499> well

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
too thick I really like that as well

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
too thick I really like that as well
even<00:01:23.280> though<00:01:23.609> it<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> moisture<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
even though it has a lot of moisture in

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.279 
even though it has a lot of moisture in
it<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.979> goes<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.399> really<00:01:26.789> smoothly<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.869> also

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
it it goes on really smoothly I also

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.010 
it it goes on really smoothly I also
really<00:01:28.829> love<00:01:29.069> how<00:01:29.249> sleek<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.119> packaging<00:01:30.749> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
really love how sleek the packaging is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
really love how sleek the packaging is
it<00:01:31.319> definitely<00:01:31.920> doesn't<00:01:32.159> look<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.639> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
it definitely doesn't look like a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
it definitely doesn't look like a
typical<00:01:33.090> deodorant<00:01:34.049> packaging<00:01:34.679> the<00:01:35.100> only

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
typical deodorant packaging the only

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.719 
typical deodorant packaging the only
downside<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.530> does<00:01:37.920> leave<00:01:38.429> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
downside to this is it does leave a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.749 
downside to this is it does leave a
white<00:01:39.420> residue<00:01:39.749> behind<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:41.219> you<00:01:41.249> apply<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
white residue behind when you apply it

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.590 
white residue behind when you apply it
but<00:01:42.889> given<00:01:43.889> the<00:01:44.069> fact<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.909> works<00:01:45.209> so<00:01:45.420> well

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
but given the fact that it works so well

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.949 
but given the fact that it works so well
it<00:01:46.229> blocks<00:01:46.619> odor<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.280> box<00:01:47.549> wetness<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.600> keeps

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
it blocks odor at box wetness it keeps

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.709 
it blocks odor at box wetness it keeps
my<00:01:49.200> skin<00:01:49.229> moisturize<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.359> mind

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
my skin moisturize I don't really mind

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.770 
my skin moisturize I don't really mind
that<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.200> leaves<00:01:52.499> a<00:01:52.740> white<00:01:52.979> residue<00:01:53.490> behind<00:01:53.780> so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that it leaves a white residue behind so

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.449 
that it leaves a white residue behind so
I'm<00:01:54.959> gonna<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.469> you<00:01:55.530> definitely<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.310> be
