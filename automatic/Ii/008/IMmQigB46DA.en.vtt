00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
voices in labour party seemly we could

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250 
voices in labour party seemly we could
see<00:03:26.519> watch<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.940> Tories<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:27.900> I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
see watch the Tories in it but I think I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.660 
see watch the Tories in it but I think I
could<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.590> I'm<00:03:28.709> having<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:29.070> around<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.489> think

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
could and I'm having this around I think

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.130 
could and I'm having this around I think
I<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.420> those<00:03:30.570> issues<00:03:30.780> where

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
I think it is one of those issues where

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.720 
I think it is one of those issues where
all<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.530> parties<00:03:31.829> after<00:03:32.070> view<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.340> from<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
all the parties after view it from the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
all the parties after view it from the
genuine<00:03:33.299> assessment<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> national

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
genuine assessment of the national

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.840 
genuine assessment of the national
interest<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.650> my<00:03:35.040> worry<00:03:35.280> about<00:03:35.340> camera<00:03:35.760> at

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
interest and my worry about camera at

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.430 
interest and my worry about camera at
the<00:03:35.880> moment<00:03:36.180> he's<00:03:36.299> just<00:03:36.480> kind<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.660> stumbling

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the moment he's just kind of stumbling

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.410 
the moment he's just kind of stumbling
along<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:38.370> have<00:03:38.519> Michael<00:03:38.790> Gove<00:03:39.150> who's

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
along to have Michael Gove who's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.640 
along to have Michael Gove who's
obviously<00:03:39.570> quite<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.989> senior<00:03:40.290> minister<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
obviously quite a senior minister in the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.920 
obviously quite a senior minister in the
cabinet<00:03:41.100> saying<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.329> he<00:03:42.420> actually<00:03:42.600> doesn't

there should be no sense of pushback on
that<00:03:46.320> from<00:03:46.590> Cameron<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.700> almost<00:03:47.880> like<00:03:48.000> he's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
that from Cameron it's almost like he's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.849 
that from Cameron it's almost like he's

phone I hope on Cameron is that because

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.690 
phone I hope on Cameron is that because
he<00:04:34.290> does<00:04:34.500> have<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.890> go<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.070> these<00:04:35.250> summits<00:04:35.640> and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
he does have to go to these summits and

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.800 
he does have to go to these summits and
even<00:04:35.940> though<00:04:36.000> their<00:04:36.180> wretched<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:36.720> they're

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
even though their wretched and they're

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.660 
even though their wretched and they're
difficult<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.350> rest<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:37.920> think<00:04:38.250> he's

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
difficult in the rest of it I think he's

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.220 
difficult in the rest of it I think he's
being<00:04:39.000> there<00:04:39.180> long<00:04:39.360> enough<00:04:39.480> now<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.780> know<00:04:39.960> that

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
being there long enough now to know that

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.500 
being there long enough now to know that
actually<00:04:40.590> he<00:04:41.130> does<00:04:41.400> have<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.760> do<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.150> lot<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.330> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
actually he does have to do a lot of the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.720 
actually he does have to do a lot of the
work<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.140> he<00:04:43.230> does<00:04:43.410> at<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:44.040> level<00:04:44.250> with

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
work that he does at that level with

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.760 
work that he does at that level with
these<00:04:44.910> other<00:04:45.120> leaders<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:46.290> idea<00:04:46.680> of

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
these other leaders and the idea of

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.560 
these other leaders and the idea of
Britain<00:04:47.190> cannot<00:04:47.490> be<00:04:47.610> out<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.850> that<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.300> think

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
Britain cannot be out of that is I think

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.360 
Britain cannot be out of that is I think
catastrophic<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.380> using<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.830> voice<00:04:50.010> of
