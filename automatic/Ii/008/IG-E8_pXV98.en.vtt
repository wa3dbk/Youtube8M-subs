00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.930 
we got where we some jelly beans I saw
these<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.340> thought<00:03:29.489> they're<00:03:29.640> really

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
these and I thought they're really

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.390 
these and I thought they're really
interesting<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.560> my<00:03:31.770> sister<00:03:32.160> loves

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
interesting so and my sister loves

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.300 
interesting so and my sister loves
frozen<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.690> thought<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.190> be<00:03:35.280> a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
frozen so I thought that this would be a

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.900 
frozen so I thought that this would be a
cool<00:03:35.610> thing<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.850> get<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:40.190> then<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.370> next<00:03:41.700> one

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
cool thing to get and then the next one

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.780 
cool thing to get and then the next one
which<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.540> all<00:03:42.690> wrapped<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.440> huge<00:03:44.400> bag<00:03:45.620> this

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
which is all wrapped up a huge bag this

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.100 
which is all wrapped up a huge bag this
is<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:52.140> key<00:03:52.320> smart<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.610> tons<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.090> keys<00:03:54.390> so

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
is the key smart I have tons of keys so

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.240 
is the key smart I have tons of keys so
I<00:03:55.470> think<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.400> would<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:57.150> very<00:03:58.250> good

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
I think this would be a very good

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.380 
I think this would be a very good
product<00:03:59.519> to<00:04:00.110> have<00:04:01.110> myself<00:04:01.590> very<00:04:02.190> handy<00:04:02.640> and
