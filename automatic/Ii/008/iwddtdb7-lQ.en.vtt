00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:28.579 
great yeah my start using

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:30.889 
great yeah my start using
music<00:05:29.579> for<00:05:29.789> most<00:05:29.879> of<00:05:30.059> my<00:05:30.119> editing<00:05:30.509> just

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:30.899 
music for most of my editing just

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.359 
music for most of my editing just
because<00:05:31.259> then<00:05:31.679> I<00:05:31.799> don't<00:05:31.829> have<00:05:32.069> to<00:05:32.309> edit<00:05:33.299> out

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:34.369 
because then I don't have to edit out

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:36.649 
because then I don't have to edit out
the<00:05:35.369> footage<00:05:35.610> which<00:05:35.939> are<00:05:36.089> capture<00:05:36.449> in<00:05:36.539> this

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
the footage which are capture in this

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.169 
the footage which are capture in this
program<00:05:37.110> see<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.099> shotgun<00:05:38.429> just<00:05:38.579> really

as far as I can tell it's the only

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.919 
as far as I can tell it's the only
program<00:05:58.319> which<00:05:58.619> allows<00:05:58.860> me<00:05:59.069> to<00:05:59.279> uh<00:05:59.689> yeah<00:06:00.689> well

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:00.929 
program which allows me to uh yeah well

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:04.339 
program which allows me to uh yeah well
capture<00:06:01.829> footage<00:06:02.729> with<00:06:03.119> sound<00:06:03.509> because<00:06:04.079> the

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:09.989 
other one I have my program as a thing

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:15.290 
other one I have my program as a thing
or<00:06:12.800> backward<00:06:13.800> sensor

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
or backward sensor

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.059 
or backward sensor
Oh<00:06:15.329> doesn't<00:06:16.229> catch<00:06:16.349> with<00:06:16.559> sound<00:06:18.739> so<00:06:19.739> she<00:06:19.860> was

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
Oh doesn't catch with sound so she was

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:26.600 
Oh doesn't catch with sound so she was
from<00:06:20.219> another<00:06:20.339> circle

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:37.530 

-<00:06:27.610> it's<00:06:27.820> great<00:06:35.610> this<00:06:36.610> is<00:06:36.790> actually<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.300> fun

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
- it's great this is actually the fun

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.270 
- it's great this is actually the fun
level<00:06:37.840> of<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.230> place<00:06:38.440> you<00:06:38.650> got<00:06:38.830> you<00:06:38.980> need<00:06:39.160> to

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
level of the place you got you need to

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.580 
level of the place you got you need to
go<00:06:39.430> up<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:39.610> which<00:06:40.510> I<00:06:40.690> never<00:06:40.900> realized<00:06:41.380> until

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
go up to which I never realized until

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.920 
go up to which I never realized until
until<00:06:44.590> later<00:06:45.240> see<00:06:46.240> we<00:06:46.360> just<00:06:46.390> say<00:06:46.630> that<00:06:46.660> guy

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
until later see we just say that guy
