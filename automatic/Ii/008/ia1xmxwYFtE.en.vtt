00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the back of the frame so it actually is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.840 
the back of the frame so it actually is
one<00:01:46.320> piece<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.860> together<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.340> two<00:01:47.520> separate

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
getting used to but the keyboard has

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.359 
getting used to but the keyboard has
full<00:02:01.200> functionality<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.890> works<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.159> well

kind<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.610> x1<00:02:31.940> carbon<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.660> it's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
kind of like the x1 carbon and it's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.870 
kind of like the x1 carbon and it's
actually<00:02:33.140> built<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.830> way<00:02:34.070> now<00:02:34.250> maglia

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.540 
actually built that way now maglia
promises<00:02:35.600> fifty<00:02:35.959> percent<00:02:36.260> lighter<00:02:36.650> than

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
promises fifty percent lighter than

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.340 
promises fifty percent lighter than
aluminum<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.600> lighter<00:02:38.959> device

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
aluminum so you have a lighter device

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.170 
aluminum so you have a lighter device
also<00:02:39.650> with<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> same<00:02:40.310> kind<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.700> durability

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
also with the same kind of durability

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.270 
also with the same kind of durability
there<00:02:41.660> now<00:02:42.200> as<00:02:42.319> we<00:02:42.410> mentioned<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.830> displays

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
there now as we mentioned that displays

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.220 
there now as we mentioned that displays
that<00:02:43.489> 2k<00:02:43.730> display<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> nice<00:02:44.690> display<00:02:45.050> is

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that 2k display it's a nice display is

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.500 
that 2k display it's a nice display is
pretty<00:02:45.470> sharp<00:02:45.890> giving<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.940> some<00:02:47.150> really<00:02:47.390> good

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
pretty sharp giving you some really good

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.330 
pretty sharp giving you some really good
quality<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.470> terms<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.770> optical

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
quality and just in terms of optical

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.160 
quality and just in terms of optical
optics<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.970> look<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.690> think<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.959> lot<00:02:51.140> of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
optics and look and I think a lot of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.620 
optics and look and I think a lot of
people<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.610> course<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.480> want

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
people like that now of course you want

people like that now of course you want
to<00:02:53.690> see<00:02:53.840> how<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.140> display<00:02:54.590> actually

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
to see how this display actually

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.620 
to see how this display actually
performs<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.000> we're<00:02:56.150> going<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.330> play<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> little

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
these speakers and how well they

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.810 
these speakers and how well they
actually<00:03:00.440> handle<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.459> can<00:03:01.580> make<00:03:01.700> your

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
actually handle and you can make your
