00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
to go ahead and do it so this did the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.250 
to go ahead and do it so this did the
bottom<00:02:19.170> first<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:21.090> did<00:02:21.360> more<00:02:21.569> bleach<00:02:21.930> on

bottom first and I did more bleach on
the<00:02:22.440> bottom<00:02:22.830> because<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.180> wanted<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> be

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the bottom because I wanted to be

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.540 
the bottom because I wanted to be
lighter<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.650> bottom<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:26.970> here

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
lighter in the bottom and then here

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.830 
lighter in the bottom and then here
normally<00:02:29.550> i<00:02:29.580> wouldn't<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:30.150> gotten<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.569> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
normally i wouldn't have gotten up this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
normally i wouldn't have gotten up this
high<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.920> ombre<00:02:32.700> starts<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.420> over

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
high because my ombre starts really over

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.040 
high because my ombre starts really over
here<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.410> i<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.709> did<00:02:34.920> like<00:02:35.040> little<00:02:35.250> streak

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
here but i just did like little streak

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.190 
here but i just did like little streak
motions<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.130> how<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.430> came<00:02:41.580> out<00:02:41.790> oh

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
motions and this is how it came out oh

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.800 
motions and this is how it came out oh
wait<00:02:43.200> I'm<00:02:43.410> gonna<00:02:43.650> turn<00:02:43.860> around<00:02:50.450> it's<00:02:51.450> pretty

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
wait I'm gonna turn around it's pretty

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.490 
wait I'm gonna turn around it's pretty
easy<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.150> think<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.110> reason<00:02:55.140> that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
easy to do I think that the reason that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
easy to do I think that the reason that
it<00:02:55.769> picked<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.430> color<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.360> me<00:02:57.540> is

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
it picked up this color for me is

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.380 
it picked up this color for me is
because<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.860> already<00:02:59.040> had<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.670> little<00:03:00.180> bit<00:03:00.360> of

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
because I already had a little bit of

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.110 
because I already had a little bit of
bleach<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.410> there<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:03.000> that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
bleach going in there but I think that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.059 
bleach going in there but I think that
this<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:04.200> only<00:03:04.709> good<00:03:05.459> for<00:03:05.489> people<00:03:05.910> who<00:03:07.069> the

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
this is only good for people who the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.339 
this is only good for people who the
whole<00:03:08.280> thing<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.880> YT<00:03:09.150> itself<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.049> great
