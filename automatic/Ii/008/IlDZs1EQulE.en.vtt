00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello everyone today I bring you the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.250
 comparison between the sj 5000 plus and the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.430
 sj 5000 wifi at the end of 2014 sj kan 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.300
 announced the release of the sj 5000 series in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 she got three models sj 5000 sj 5000 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.470
 wifi and sj 5000 plus the sj 5000 and sj 5000 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.839
 wifi are the same camera just change that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.460
 one carries wifi and the other does not otherwise 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.100
 are equal so the quality of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.800
 recording is exactly riveted the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.199
 difference is with the sj 5000 plus already 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 that the sj 5000 carries a panasonic sensor 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.120
 of 14 megapixels and a novatech chip that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 allows us to record 1080p at 30 frames 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.160
 per second and 720p to 60 frames per 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.500
 second while in the sj 5000 plus 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.269
 we have a panasonic sensor of 16 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.340
 megapixels and an amber chip on which 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.489
 allows us to record 1080p at 60 frames 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 per second and 720p to 120 frames per 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 second and in case anyone asks 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.790
 the sj 5000 plus also has wifi as 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.070
 you can imagine the prices are 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.690
 different and the jce aj 5000 plus is the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.450
 most expensive of the series with a price of 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.320
 about 160 euros while the sj 5000 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 wifi costs 1 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.940
 125 130 euros are aesthetically 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.530
 practically equal all that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.800
 change is the back screen since the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.130
 sj 5000 plus has it of 1.5 inches and 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.930
 the sj 5000 of 2 inches the two cameras 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 they carry the same 900 battery 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.940
 milliamperes that in the case of the sj 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.310
 5000 plus recording at 1080p at 30 frames 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.250
 per second gives an autonomy of about 78 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.160
 80 minutes and in the case of the cj 5000 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.050
 It also lasts about 80 minutes if we 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.850
 seems little autonomy we can buy 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.770
 1100 milliamp batteries for 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.360
 increase the recording time in the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.130
 description I leave the link for your 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.810
 buy if you are interested too 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.880
 I leave the purchase links of both cameras 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.009
 All accessories are compatible 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 between the two cameras including the housing 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.729
 it's the same on my channel you have the reviews 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.050
 complete of the two cameras in case 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.850
 you want to know more about your 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.950
 performance accessories that includes 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.690
 both cameras I have tried to update 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.519
 the latest versions of the firmware 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.800
 the date on which this was recorded 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.660
 analysis in the case of the sj 5000 plus 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.730
 when I did the review the firmware was 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.739
 a quite unstable version now 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.720
 we are with the 2.1 and it seems that 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.340
 substantially improved although still 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.450
 he has room for improvement 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.730
 but that they go out more 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 updates and now we go to the middle 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 of the subject to see how they record and take 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.430
 photographs the two action cameras 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.620
 Now you are watching a video recorded to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.480
 1080p at 30 frames per second with the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.370
 Default settings in both cameras 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.500
 you can see that the two cameras 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.569
 have the same recording angle in 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.299
 how much bitrate per second the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.790
 sj 5000 plus has to this resolution and 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.640
 frames per second about 18 megabits 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.519
 second while in the sj 5000 it's from 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.290
 about 15 megabits second both cameras to 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.180
 this resolution get very results 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.890
 good but to try to be a little 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.510
 more thorough I will show you a 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.269
 frame of this video I will expand 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.280
 As you can see there is not too much 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.630
 difference in definition and sharpness 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.879
 biggest difference is in the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.790
 color hue more yellowish 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.220
 the sj 5000 plus and more bluish in the sj 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.140
 5000 one of the fattest differences 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.420
 between the two cameras is the possibility 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.090
 which has the sj 5000 plus to record to 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.069
 1080p at 60 frames per second and so that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.900
 you see this difference I am putting you 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.959
 a series of slow motion made with the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.760
 two cameras at 1080p as sj 5000 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.920
 only record 30 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.360
 per second when we lower the speed 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.519
 of reproduction in the middle of 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.230
 movement is less fluid and smooth by 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.599
 what the result is less professional 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.549
 since we would be seeing about 15 frames 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.200
 per second and so that our eye 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.659
 start to see a smooth movement and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.680
 continuous we need at least 24 or 25 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.069
 frames per second 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.959
 the same happens to 720p the sj 5000 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.269
 Plus can record at 120 frames per 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.700
 second while the sj 5000 can 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.079
 up to 60 pri per second if we lower the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.790
 playback speed up to a 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.400
 fourth to make a slow motion in the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.489
 sj 5000 plus we remain fluid but the sj 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.889
 5000 not returning to another shot made to 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.260
 1080p at 30 frames per second I want you 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.450
 comment that the sj 5000 plus keeps the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.400
 files in 24 point format while 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.069
 that the ones of j 5000 do it in format 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.900
 point mode if you are looking for a camera of these 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.269
 to only make videos your decision 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.100
 of purchase by one or the other should be centered 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.490
 if you're interested in having 60 frames per 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.550
 second at 1080p and 120 frames per second 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.039
 at 720p it seems very interesting to me 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.560
 have these options give you a lot of play 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.240
 and the result of the 1080p videos to 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.539
 60 frames according to 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.430
 in the sj 5000 plus is frankly good 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.710
 Now I want to show you a shot with 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.660
 little luminosity concretely I have 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.150
 recorded in the oceanographic of valencia 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.800
 in the shark area is a 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.569
 way that we get an idea of 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.300
 how to record underwater and by the 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.789
 night the recording is still at 1080p 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.470
 at 30 frames per second the result of 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.419
 I like the two cameras and I think 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.699
 good again in the main 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.650
 difference resides in the colors something 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.509
 that we can modify from the settings 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.520
 of the camera in the section of the balance 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.789
 of targets in the photographic section 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.099
 both the sj 5000 and the sj 5000 plus 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.470
 they have improved a lot with respect to the sj 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.560
 4000 get photos with more resolution 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.470
 better colors and better dynamic range 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.409
 the sj 5000 plus has 16 megapixels 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.240
 while the sj 5000 takes photos of 14 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.069
 megapixels is saved by that 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.229
 difference the quality in photos is very 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.210
 similar to 2 and we will be able to obtain 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.139
 good photos with any of these two 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.150
 cameras 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.479
 both action camps allow us to perform 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.639
 timelapse but the sj 5000 plus have the 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.169
 option to take pictures in burst mode that 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.330
 will allow us to draw up 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.819
 of photos in about two seconds things that 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.259
 the sj 5000 we can not do to 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.240
 then we will leave with the 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.610
 audio that these two cameras capture in 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.439
 this aspect the sj 5000 plus offers 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.659
 better options and a stereo sound 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.610
 with it we can modify the gain 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.349
 of the microphone and because of that with the 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.150
 water casing bet is going to listen 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.150
 more sound than the sj 5000 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.350
 to finish the video I want to give you my 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.350
 personal opinion is undeniable that the sj 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.000
 5000 plus is higher than cj 5000 since 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.040
 has many more options 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.350
 recording is to say that if you think you're going 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.740
 to record videos at 1080p at 60 pace 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.780
 second or 720p at 120 frames per second 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.780
 I honestly think it's worth it 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.000
 go for this camera instead if only 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.860
 you are looking for a camera to record and take out 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.360
 good pictures without the need for 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.240
 edit to make for example slow 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.580
 motion the sj 5000 is more than enough 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.350
 this has been all for today if it has 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.280
 liked the video give it a like and 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.280
