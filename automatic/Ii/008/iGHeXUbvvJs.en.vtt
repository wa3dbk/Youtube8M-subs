00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
able to pull it up I'll have to pry just

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.370 
able to pull it up I'll have to pry just
a<00:03:08.530> little<00:03:08.739> bit<00:03:09.720> again<00:03:10.720> there's<00:03:11.049> wires

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
a little bit again there's wires

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.880 
a little bit again there's wires
attached<00:03:11.860> here<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.269> for<00:03:13.540> your<00:03:13.890> window

and you just again there's another tab

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.870 
and you just again there's another tab
you<00:03:17.890> just<00:03:17.920> push<00:03:18.250> down<00:03:18.930> should<00:03:19.930> just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you just push down should just

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.870 
you just push down should just
disconnect<00:03:21.880> like<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:23.130> set<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.280> aside<00:03:24.459> so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
disconnect like that set this aside so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.240 
disconnect like that set this aside so
after<00:03:25.810> we've<00:03:25.959> removed<00:03:26.140> all<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.500> screws<00:03:26.709> we're
