00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
this is a summary of some changes that I

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.769 
this is a summary of some changes that I
made<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.570> my<00:00:03.600> video<00:00:03.959> distribution<00:00:04.879> I<00:00:05.879> decided

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
made to my video distribution I decided

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.379 
made to my video distribution I decided
to<00:00:07.020> shave<00:00:07.200> about<00:00:07.560> 70<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.460> 80<00:00:08.490> dollars<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> month

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
to shave about 70 to 80 dollars a month

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.919 
to shave about 70 to 80 dollars a month
off<00:00:09.630> by<00:00:10.490> my<00:00:11.490> bills<00:00:11.730> by<00:00:12.389> switching

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
off by my bills by switching

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.230 
off by my bills by switching
over-the-air<00:00:13.349> broadcasts<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.790> drop<00:00:15.089> my

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
over-the-air broadcasts and drop my

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.439 
over-the-air broadcasts and drop my
cable<00:00:15.630> provider<00:00:15.859> I<00:00:16.970> can't<00:00:17.970> imagine<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
cable provider I can't imagine a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.269 
cable provider I can't imagine a
satellite<00:00:18.869> TV<00:00:19.199> provider<00:00:19.590> being<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.100> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
satellite TV provider being all that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.700 
satellite TV provider being all that
much<00:00:20.460> cheaper<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> long<00:00:21.990> run<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
much cheaper in the long run so I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.790 
much cheaper in the long run so I
decided<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:24.180> give<00:00:25.050> them<00:00:25.199> both<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.619> boot

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
decided to to give them both the boot

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279 
decided to to give them both the boot
and<00:00:26.609> switchover<00:00:27.359> air<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> little<00:00:28.170> while

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and switchover air for a little while

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.460 
and switchover air for a little while
and<00:00:29.099> how<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.390> connected<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.320> an

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and how I do that is I I connected up an

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.420 
and how I do that is I I connected up an
HD<00:00:31.800> antenna<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.780> an<00:00:33.780> unused<00:00:34.140> jack<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
HD antenna in an unused jack and a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
HD antenna in an unused jack and a
bedroom<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.390> highest<00:00:36.750> floor<00:00:37.020> run<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bedroom on my highest floor run that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.660 
bedroom on my highest floor run that
through<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> notch<00:00:38.489> filter<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:40.550> run<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
through a notch filter and run it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330 
through a notch filter and run it
through<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.379> splitter<00:00:43.379> slash<00:00:43.829> combiner

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
through a splitter slash combiner

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
through a splitter slash combiner
there's<00:00:44.820> nothing<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.210> fancy<00:00:45.450> about<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
there's nothing really fancy about a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
there's nothing really fancy about a
splitter<00:00:46.320> versus<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> combiner<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> use

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
splitter versus a combiner you can use

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.420 
splitter versus a combiner you can use
either<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.200> both<00:00:49.350> functions<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.190> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
either one for both functions it's just

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.790 
either one for both functions it's just
how<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.850> connect<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:52.100> I<00:00:53.100> take<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
how you connect it up I take the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.319 
how you connect it up I take the
over-the-air<00:00:55.800> signal<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> run<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> into<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
over-the-air signal and run it into this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
over-the-air signal and run it into this
inexpensive<00:00:58.609> DTA<00:00:59.719> they're<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.989> $25<00:01:01.800> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
inexpensive DTA they're about $25 you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
inexpensive DTA they're about $25 you
can<00:01:02.100> pick<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.550> from<00:01:03.090> any<00:01:03.359> number<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
can pick them up from any number of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
can pick them up from any number of
manufacturers<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.920> happens<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.430> from

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
manufacturers this happens to be from

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.039 
manufacturers this happens to be from
Access<00:01:06.180> HD<00:01:07.939> which<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.180> converts<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
Access HD which then converts the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.120 
Access HD which then converts the
over-the-air<00:01:10.500> signals<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.490> RF<00:01:11.909> modulated

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
over-the-air signals to an RF modulated

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
over-the-air signals to an RF modulated
Channel<00:01:14.130> three<00:01:14.430> signal<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> run

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
Channel three signal which then I run

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.149 
Channel three signal which then I run
back<00:01:16.470> up<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> recombined<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
back up here and recombined with the the

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
back up here and recombined with the the
over-the-air<00:01:20.159> digital<00:01:20.820> TV<00:01:21.150> transmissions

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
over-the-air digital TV transmissions

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
over-the-air digital TV transmissions
then<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> take<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.670> run<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> through<00:01:24.119> my

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
then I take that and I run it through my

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.170 
then I take that and I run it through my
whole<00:01:24.570> home<00:01:24.810> amplifier<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> my

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
whole home amplifier and then up to my

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
whole home amplifier and then up to my
junction<00:01:27.600> block<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.080> distributes<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
junction block which distributes the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.149 
junction block which distributes the
video<00:01:29.100> signals<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> entire<00:01:30.540> house<00:01:31.159> what

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
video signals to the entire house what

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.249 
video signals to the entire house what
this<00:01:32.280> allows<00:01:32.520> me<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:34.020> older

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this allows me to do is for older

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
this allows me to do is for older
televisions<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> don't<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> digital
