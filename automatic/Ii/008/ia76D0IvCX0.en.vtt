00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.480
 hi all the guys are altair 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.990
 bridgend and welcome to the first episode 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.240
 of cultures in live or commented 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.210
 live from me of the first expansion 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.490
 of skyrim provided by the bethesda ie 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.279
 don guard from bacteria and therefore give 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.100
 start this wonderful adventure will be enough 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.320
 talk to any guard or not 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.110
 you have so many capitals of skyrim 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.730
 in this case we are at the entrance 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.859
 of white man 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.480
 so now we will try to talk to 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:58.190
 one of the two guards we are 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:59.269
 viewing, let's try thank you for 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.670
 the information 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.400
 at this point we started the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.620
 quest the dawn then looks our first 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.530
 goal will be to talk to the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.810
 head of don guard so we will have to 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.720
 reach this place indicated by 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.119
 map we reach here we are guys 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.130
 finally after a long journey 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.970
 I reached the place indicated by the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.820
 map 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.470
 here we are and let's get right in 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.470
 this cave 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.740
 here we are these should be the way to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.470
 to be able to reach the bard fort 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.660
 so without wasting too much time 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.180
 let's reach him schmidt why 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.460
 I'm really curious 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.100
 let's see how this will be done 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 what can this quest offer us 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 from what can be seen what they would be 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 the waterfalls that are viewed ahead 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:08.880
 the trailer 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:10.920
 during the videos of 3 from 10 a man to the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.160
 beyond gravity guys I'm still 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.720
 undecided whether it is part of don guard o 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.820
 join the vaults of the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.240
 vampires because they could anyway 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.090
 transform have that metamorphosis of 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.030
 to be able to turn into a demon and have 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.950
 all those skills could be 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.990
 very useful but also very fun 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.700
 evidence at the moment are some undecided 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:39.480
 we will see at the moment here is the fort of don 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.489
 looked very nice with the reflection of the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.489
 above all really amazing sun 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.109
 then yes yes no however from the point of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.879
 aesthetic view I can really say that 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:00.500
 this really is really amazing 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.079
 it should be the way it will take us 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.430
 then at the entrance of the fort of don 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.430
 guard says a hearth a crossbow 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.239
 beautiful I can't wait to use 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.909
 also the crossbow from this is another 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.010
 really interesting object added 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.419
 in this expansion that surely 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.280
 we will have to use it as soon as possible 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.849
 try all the advantages of this 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.150
 stupendous weapon is something really not 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.150
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.510
 the right person 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.760
 come in and find it ok let's continue e 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.959
 advancing in this door we will enter into the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.549
 strong of dunga 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.549
 obviously we continue 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.060
 here we are guys we went into 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.189
 the entrance to the don guard fort is there 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.620
 two knights for sure that one 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.079
 on the left should be the head 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.290
 of don guard but we discover them anyway 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.290
 together 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.509
 you have felt very happy that the voice has been 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.190
 spread around but that means that 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.160
 soon it will also reach the ear of the 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.560
 children I really think so what I can 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.419
 do to help I need someone 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.030

 vampires open-faced while we settle 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.789
 the strong Giovanni said of a tavern 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.870
 in which vigilantes were poking their noses 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:45.810
 could have something to do with the recent ones 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:49.699
 children attacks the crypt of di 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.520

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.160
 vampiric lost in the mists of time 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.680

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.580

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.680
