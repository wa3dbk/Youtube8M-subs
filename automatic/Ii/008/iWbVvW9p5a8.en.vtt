00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.040
 welcome to my channel today I bring you the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.809
 video of neighborhood school supplies 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.680

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.680
 all the video 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 the first thing is to teach some little things 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.759
 that are not school material but 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 well the first thing is to be here that is 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.779
 to exercise that is music 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.720
 that you put on the floor for that to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.239
 I do is dedication and it's in shades 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.900

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 I also bought this viewer from here that

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.790

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.430

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.650
 pretty finite the spaces I of the year 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.640

 all the case then then this year 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.159
 what I'm going to do is get into this 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.769

 those of last year and I had taught them 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.610
 and well they are very basic that I like 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.800
 because they are tiny and I can 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.510
