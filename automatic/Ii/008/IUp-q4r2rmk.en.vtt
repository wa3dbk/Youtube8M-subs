feature<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.420> least<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.170> getting<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
feature and at least you are getting a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.980 
feature and at least you are getting a
say<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.030> mean<00:01:18.180> who<00:01:18.360> knows<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.869> mean

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
say in it and I mean who knows I mean

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140

Triple<00:01:21.479> A<00:01:21.570> games<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.140> day<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:23.490> it'd

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
Triple A games one day and I think it'd

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
knack infamous and killzone maybe I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
knack infamous and killzone maybe I
think<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.009> would<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> pretty<00:01:29.369> fun<00:01:29.670> vote<00:01:30.119> to
