00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.770
 and the sixth is being done 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.770
 robotics competition 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 and people come from all over the country to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.650
 compete with the main 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.740
 difference between the category that has 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.140
 our competence in the sum and if it is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.180
 one is in charge of competing in speed 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 arrives until you reach the goal first and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.770
 the other is to draw from outside the round 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.469
 the other reconverted I'm not Gonzalo 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 servet and ipen 50 San Francisco 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.559
 cÃ³rdoba a technical school that has 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.620
 Various narrow specialties 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.719
 electronic and presented it to us as a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 school project participate in the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 competition 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.699
 first we participate the zonal instance 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.519
 from our city one of our 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.319
 comrades came out champion and in the city 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.159
 I do not want to pay for the trip every word 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.159
 we compete 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:06.259
 over the round and then it rises up 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.470
 the 5 seconds these robots are 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.740
 fully automatic detect with 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.290
 tension the opponents on the contrary and the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.020
 Try to 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 they try to get us out of range 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.240
 part first of the physical idea in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.280
 heavens I bought the physical form of the robot 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.799
 and we started to design the parts 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.259
 electronic help with the teacher and 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.030
 we teach the program and it's good proof 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.909
 error test error like all 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.700
 experiments its part of error already very 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.299
 until no one comes out can go have 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.299
 to be real 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.220
 the competitions are pretty 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.360
 fast but the robots take a long time 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.310
 time to build we are some cms and 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:02.600
 another takes years to get it ready 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.869
 so that the breasts are tips is 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 very meticulous much instrument much 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.910
 electronic knowledge ask 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.160
 references with the professors digits 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.230
 from different areas we have professors from 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.620
 mechanics that are helping us with the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.620
 Mechanic system 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.130
 very much I liked the electronics the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.350
 Robotics was also a very big taste 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.030
 I always had good thing is we 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.170
 present the opportunity we participate 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.170
 everyone right away 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.670
 we come from high school florida 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.710
 we measure is convinced every year 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.420
 more than five years ago we come to 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.710
 different classes for example you can 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.970
 use ultrasonic sounds routes or for 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.650
 by laser beams 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.650
 different quality 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.800
 is a sport a science or a 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.330
 passionate to see a mix where 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.300
 it requires reflexes requires 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.580
 knowledge that you could already have 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.130
 after science but also it 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.959
 dedicated density a sport since 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.910
 requires knowledge development of this 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.770
 practical experience for not going 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.140
 concluding for a convention for 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.360
 winning is something that can be shown and 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.100
 put all your intelligence effort aside 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.230
 be studying the students then 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.270
 everything that is student in a robot 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.590
 and you can see it and I started the effort all 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.590
 all the owner's efforts 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.220
 and would only classify as all together and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.840
 more than anything a passion because you 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.910
 He spends a lot of time and he has to 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.910
 like a lot to be able to do it
