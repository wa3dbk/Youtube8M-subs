early<00:01:35.820> which<00:01:36.270> tends<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.720> happen<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.830> see

here the last bomb bomb site and you'll
see<00:03:53.709> me<00:03:53.829> get<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.040> plan<00:03:54.340> on<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:55.299> which<00:03:55.630> it

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
see me get a plan on a in which it

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.039 
see me get a plan on a in which it
doesn't<00:03:56.140> go<00:03:56.350> quite<00:03:56.739> according<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.459> plan<00:03:57.519> but

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
doesn't go quite according to plan but

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.170 
doesn't go quite according to plan but
the<00:03:59.049> idea<00:03:59.350> with<00:03:59.500> this<00:03:59.590> plant<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:01.000> you're

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
the idea with this plant is that you're

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.199 
the idea with this plant is that you're
not<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.810> direct<00:04:02.260> eye<00:04:02.700> sight<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.940> people

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
not in the direct eye sight of people

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.210 
not in the direct eye sight of people
that<00:04:04.360> are<00:04:04.450> coming<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.810> fuse<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.170> ball<00:04:05.350> because

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
that are coming to fuse the ball because

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.490 
that are coming to fuse the ball because
when<00:04:07.150> you're<00:04:07.420> sitting<00:04:07.690> there<00:04:07.810> watching<00:04:08.140> the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
when you're sitting there watching the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.650 
when you're sitting there watching the
bomb<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.860> your<00:04:08.980> eye<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.340> bomb<00:04:09.670> people

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
bomb have your eye on the bomb people

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.620 
bomb have your eye on the bomb people

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
are much more likely to see it so if you

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.630 
are much more likely to see it so if you
