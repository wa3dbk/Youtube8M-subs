00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
like how when we like trying to figure

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.349 
like how when we like trying to figure
it<00:01:53.499> out<00:01:53.709> and<00:01:53.950> then<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.310> there's<00:01:54.819> a<00:01:54.939> view<00:01:55.149> here

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
it out and then we there's a view here

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.070 
the mathematical vocabulary on reasoning
-<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:06.039> wonderful<00:02:06.639> the<00:02:06.969> definition<00:02:07.810> it

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
- just it's wonderful the definition it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.710 
- just it's wonderful the definition it
really<00:02:08.440> breaks<00:02:08.679> down<00:02:09.090> everything

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
really breaks down everything

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.600 
really breaks down everything
then<00:02:10.990> means<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.590> subtract<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.550> then

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
then means that you subtract and then

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.190 
then means that you subtract and then
you<00:02:13.030> said<00:02:13.240> more<00:02:13.480> than<00:02:13.540> use<00:02:14.050> what<00:02:15.690> you're<00:02:16.690> okay

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you said more than use what you're okay

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.280 
you said more than use what you're okay
so<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.040> went<00:02:18.310> back<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.730> found<00:02:19.030> those<00:02:19.780> key

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
so you went back and you found those key

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.190 
so you went back and you found those key

good job in both classrooms that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.420 
good job in both classrooms that
teachers<00:02:28.960> are<00:02:29.200> able<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.500> see<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.950> successes

I've<00:02:32.560> seen<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.720> several<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.840> my

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
I've seen in this is several of my

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.360 
I've seen in this is several of my
students<00:02:35.320> were<00:02:35.440> below<00:02:35.710> level<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.160> some<00:02:36.310> of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
students were below level and some of

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.880 
students were below level and some of
these<00:02:36.460> topics<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.150> what<00:02:38.080> reasoning<00:02:38.530> mine<00:02:38.710> did

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
these topics so what reasoning mine did

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.410 
these topics so what reasoning mine did
was<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.160> saw<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.850> dropped<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.300> back

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
was they saw that and it dropped it back

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.360 
was they saw that and it dropped it back
to<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.690> second<00:02:41.080> grade<00:02:41.200> level<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.160> kids

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
to the second grade level and the kids

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.920 
to the second grade level and the kids
got<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.580> work<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:43.060> extra<00:02:43.480> addition<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
got to work on extra addition and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.260 
got to work on extra addition and
subtraction<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.470> they<00:02:44.680> needed<00:02:45.040> or<00:02:45.459> one<00:02:46.000> step

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
subtraction that they needed or one step

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.910 
subtraction that they needed or one step
problem-solving<00:02:46.870> before<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> two-step<00:02:47.650> so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
problem-solving before the two-step so

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.160 
problem-solving before the two-step so
even<00:02:48.250> though<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.459> starts<00:02:48.790> at<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.910> level<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
even though it starts at a level here it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930 
even though it starts at a level here it
was<00:02:50.350> able<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.620> drop<00:02:50.890> down<00:02:51.100> with<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> child<00:02:51.670> was

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
was able to drop down with a child was

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.040 
was able to drop down with a child was
and<00:02:52.180> then<00:02:52.300> bring<00:02:52.480> them<00:02:52.600> right<00:02:52.720> back<00:02:52.870> up<00:02:53.020> to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
and then bring them right back up to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.540 
and then bring them right back up to
grade<00:02:53.260> level<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.070> awesome

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
grade level it was awesome

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.400 
grade level it was awesome
it<00:02:55.060> was<00:02:55.150> awesome<00:02:55.450> meanwhile<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.260> still

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
it was awesome meanwhile it's still

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.840 
it was awesome meanwhile it's still
rewarding<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.920> child<00:02:57.130> for<00:02:57.310> every<00:02:57.400> question<00:02:57.670> I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
rewarding the child for every question I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.280 
rewarding the child for every question I
get<00:02:57.970> correct<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.720> they<00:02:58.810> don't<00:02:58.959> see<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.170> as<00:02:59.260> a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
get correct so they don't see it as a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.350 
get correct so they don't see it as a
punishment<00:02:59.530> they<00:03:00.490> see<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.790> well<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.209> do

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
punishment they see it as well I can do

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.800 
punishment they see it as well I can do
this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:10.380 
this
so<00:03:02.200> was<00:03:02.350> building<00:03:02.650> their<00:03:02.740> confidence<00:03:02.890> up<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
so was building their confidence up the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.540 
so was building their confidence up the
end<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.990> class<00:03:11.200> period<00:03:11.560> we'll<00:03:12.160> go<00:03:12.340> we'll

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
end of the class period we'll go we'll

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.150 
end of the class period we'll go we'll
have<00:03:12.580> our<00:03:12.820> small<00:03:13.030> celebrations<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.440> who<00:03:14.950> had
