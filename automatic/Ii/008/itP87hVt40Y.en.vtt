00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.309 

you've<00:00:06.089> been<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> climber<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.870> now<00:00:07.049> you're<00:00:07.290> a

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
you've been a climber and now you're a

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.040 
you've been a climber and now you're a
BASE<00:00:07.589> jumper<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.360> which<00:00:09.360> what<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
BASE jumper and which what are the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.589 
BASE jumper and which what are the
differences<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.500> which<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.889> prefer<00:00:11.599> climbing

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
differences in which you prefer climbing

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.369 
differences in which you prefer climbing
is<00:00:13.280> in<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.639> ways<00:00:14.849> more<00:00:15.379> physically

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
is in some ways more physically

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.609 
is in some ways more physically
technical<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.400> would<00:00:17.760> say<00:00:18.500> definitely<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> lot

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
technical I would say definitely a lot

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.470 
technical I would say definitely a lot
more<00:00:19.770> strength<00:00:20.130> dependent<00:00:20.820> which<00:00:24.890> and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
more strength dependent which and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.470 
more strength dependent which and
jumping<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.570> find<00:00:27.840> more<00:00:28.470> body<00:00:29.039> awareness<00:00:29.480> more

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
jumping I find more body awareness more

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.799 
jumping I find more body awareness more
so<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.869> pure<00:00:31.080> strength<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.420> with

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so than pure strength I think with

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.630 
so than pure strength I think with
climbing<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:34.980> climbing<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
climbing I think climbing you can I

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
climbing I think climbing you can I
think<00:00:38.640> there's<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.450> margin

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
think there's a little more margin

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.220 
think there's a little more margin
sometimes<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.309> screwing<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.110> know

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
sometimes for screwing up and you know

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.250 
sometimes for screwing up and you know
gaining<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.710> experience<00:00:44.660> whereas<00:00:45.660> with

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
gaining your experience whereas with

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.610 
gaining your experience whereas with
jumping<00:00:46.890> perhaps<00:00:47.719> it<00:00:48.719> may<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.930> physically

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
jumping perhaps it may be physically

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010 
jumping perhaps it may be physically
easier<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.489> cases<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> doing<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> but

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
easier in some cases to be doing it but

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.520 
easier in some cases to be doing it but
yet<00:00:52.309> there's<00:00:53.309> less<00:00:53.610> margin<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.480> messing<00:00:55.379> up

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
yet there's less margin for messing up

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.830 
yet there's less margin for messing up
in<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> big<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.660> they're

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
in a big way so I don't know they're

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
in a big way so I don't know they're
there<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.350> ways<00:00:58.500> pretty<00:00:58.770> different<00:00:59.030> it's

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
there in some ways pretty different it's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
there in some ways pretty different it's
hard<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> say<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.930> better<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.340> feel

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
hard to say which I like better I feel

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.810 
hard to say which I like better I feel
like<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.629> easy<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.949> me<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> jump

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like it's easy for me to want to jump

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.090 
like it's easy for me to want to jump
all<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> time<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.040> much

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
all the time because I like it so much

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.630 
all the time because I like it so much
but<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:10.409> climb<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.430> miss

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but then if I don't climb then I miss

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.320 
but then if I don't climb then I miss
climbing<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.700> at<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.299> feel

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
climbing a lot so at this point I feel

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.740 
climbing a lot so at this point I feel
as<00:01:15.869> though<00:01:15.920> I'm<00:01:16.920> kind<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
as though I'm kind of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.980 
as though I'm kind of
and<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.010> it<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:20.400> made<00:01:21.120> you<00:01:21.570> decide<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and what was it that made you decide to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.130 
and what was it that made you decide to
kind<00:01:22.800> of<00:01:22.860> taper<00:01:23.700> off<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> climbing<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> do

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
kind of taper off the climbing and do

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.070 
kind of taper off the climbing and do
more<00:01:25.350> BASE<00:01:25.560> jumping<00:01:26.010> well<00:01:26.910> not<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.600> taper

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
more BASE jumping well not so much taper

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.540 
more BASE jumping well not so much taper
off<00:01:28.230> I<00:01:28.350> guess<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> struggle<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
off I guess that's the struggle is that

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.390 
off I guess that's the struggle is that
I'm<00:01:29.790> trying<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.320> jump<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> time<00:01:31.800> I'm

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
I'm trying to jump all the time I'm

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.070 
I'm trying to jump all the time I'm
trying<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> climb<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> time<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.780> I

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
trying to climb all the time it's that I

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.840 
trying to climb all the time it's that I
need<00:01:34.440> like<00:01:34.680> twice<00:01:35.370> as<00:01:35.550> much<00:01:35.670> time<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.850> it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
need like twice as much time but it's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.110 
need like twice as much time but it's
definitely<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.380> am<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.490> equally<00:01:41.850> passionate

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
definitely I I am so equally passionate

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.120 
definitely I I am so equally passionate
about<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.230> things<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.620> then<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.010> as

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
about the things and then you know as

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.830 
about the things and then you know as
well<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.550> me<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.790> skydiving<00:01:45.510> because<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
well for me there skydiving because I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.990 
well for me there skydiving because I
like<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> fly<00:01:46.440> week<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> skydiving<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:47.940> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
like to fly week to skydiving so you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.250 
like to fly week to skydiving so you
practice<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.840> almost<00:01:48.990> like

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
practice that so it's almost like

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.500 
practice that so it's almost like
there's<00:01:49.470> three<00:01:49.650> things<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.220> trying<00:01:50.370> to<00:01:50.640> mix

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
there's three things I'm trying to mix

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.080 
there's three things I'm trying to mix
around<00:01:51.869> together<00:01:52.050> so<00:01:52.619> basically<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
around together so basically it just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:23.380 
around together so basically it just
means<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.680> more<00:01:56.040> busy

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.450 

you
