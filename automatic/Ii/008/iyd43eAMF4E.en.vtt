finger<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:59.660> can<00:01:00.660> use<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> smaller<00:01:01.230> slide<00:01:01.559> again

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
finger you can use a smaller slide again

finger you can use a smaller slide again
there's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> tiny<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.690> that's<00:01:06.680> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
there's a tiny little one so that's it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950 
there's a tiny little one so that's it
has<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> number<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.250> different<00:01:08.640> advantages<00:01:09.299> one

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
has a number of different advantages one

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.080 
has a number of different advantages one
of<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.680> um<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.729> small<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of which is that it's um it's small and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.620 
of which is that it's um it's small and
likely<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.840> lead<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> play<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:17.630> current

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
likely to lead you to play with current

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.560 
likely to lead you to play with current
favorite<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> old<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.180> old<00:01:21.180> ball<00:01:21.330> neck

favorite is the old the old ball neck
yeah<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.380> gonna<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:22.950> now

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
yeah so I'm just gonna use it for now

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.230 
yeah so I'm just gonna use it for now
now<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> reason<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.430> perhaps<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
now the reason that you want perhaps a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
now the reason that you want perhaps a
light<00:01:27.450> slide<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.080> you're<00:01:28.200> having<00:01:28.409> trouble

light slide if you're having trouble
with<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:30.020> making<00:01:31.020> noise<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.650> slide

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
with with making noise with your slide

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
with with making noise with your slide
is<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.360> need<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.750> light

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
is that you really need a very light

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.319 
is that you really need a very light
touch<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:35.159> you've<00:01:35.400> got<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.939> you've<00:01:36.060> got

touch if you've got a lot if you've got
a<00:01:36.360> light<00:01:36.570> touch<00:01:36.810> practice<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.740> general

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
a light touch practice in your general

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.440 
a light touch practice in your general
playing<00:01:39.920> then<00:01:40.920> it'll<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.850> easy<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
playing then it'll be easy for you to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.429 
playing then it'll be easy for you to
come<00:01:42.840> down<00:01:42.869> lightly<00:01:43.380> okay<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:45.320> if<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
come down lightly okay if you if you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
come down lightly okay if you if you
tend<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> play<00:01:46.860> heavy<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.399> press<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
tend to play heavy and press down on the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
tend to play heavy and press down on the
strings<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:49.380> tension<00:01:49.860> you'll<00:01:50.040> tend<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> come

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
strings in tension you'll tend to come

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.289 
strings in tension you'll tend to come
down<00:01:50.909> heavy<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.320> too<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:54.119> main

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
down heavy like that too so the main

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
down heavy like that too so the main
thing<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> develop<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.380> light<00:01:55.590> touch

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
thing is to develop a light touch

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.880 
thing is to develop a light touch
generally<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.670> your<00:01:56.850> playing<00:01:57.060> now

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
generally with your playing now

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.260 
generally with your playing now
specifically<00:01:58.890> though<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.640> bring<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.969> slide

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
specifically though to bring your slide

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.980 
specifically though to bring your slide
down<00:02:00.509> without<00:02:01.219> clanking<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:03.030> need<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.329> work

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
down without clanking you need to work

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.399 
down without clanking you need to work
the<00:02:04.200> fingers<00:02:04.500> behind<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.009> slide<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> they

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the fingers behind the slide so they

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.199 
the fingers behind the slide so they
sort<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> come<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.129> at<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> same<00:02:08.580> time<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
sort of come down at the same time you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.390 
sort of come down at the same time you
know<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.599> little<00:02:09.929> bit<00:02:10.080> before<00:02:10.530> microsecond

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
know a little bit before microsecond

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.380 
know a little bit before microsecond
before<00:02:11.700> perhaps

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
before perhaps

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.210 
before perhaps
they<00:02:12.990> need<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> come<00:02:13.410> down<00:02:13.560> at<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.680> same<00:02:13.920> time

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
they need to come down at the same time

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.820 
they need to come down at the same time
so<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.760> notice<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> difference<00:02:15.420> between

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
so you notice the difference between

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.850 
so you notice the difference between
that<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:18.290> they<00:02:19.290> were<00:02:19.350> still<00:02:19.530> made<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> bit

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
that and that they were still made a bit

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.660 
that and that they were still made a bit
of<00:02:19.950> noise<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.700> hit<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:20.940> hard<00:02:21.270> but<00:02:22.670> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
of noise because I hit it hard but you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.130 
of noise because I hit it hard but you
can<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.209> feel<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> hear<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> difference

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
can you can feel the hear the difference

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.949 
can you can feel the hear the difference
now<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:25.950> come<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.160> lightly<00:02:26.900> there's<00:02:27.900> a

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
now if we come down lightly there's a

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.020 
now if we come down lightly there's a
bit<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.140> noise<00:02:30.260> still<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.560> bit<00:02:31.680> there

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
bit of noise still a little bit there

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.640 
bit of noise still a little bit there
you're<00:02:33.030> gonna<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.420> bit<00:02:34.370> but<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
you're gonna get a little bit but you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.870 
you're gonna get a little bit but you
you<00:02:37.650> gotta<00:02:37.830> get<00:02:37.980> noise<00:02:38.130> from<00:02:38.400> speaking<00:02:38.730> with

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
you gotta get noise from speaking with

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.940 
you gotta get noise from speaking with
your<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.450> anyway<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.750> don't<00:02:39.989> slide

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
your right in it anyway you don't slide

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.170 
your right in it anyway you don't slide
up<00:02:41.100> behind<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.640> don't<00:02:41.819> want<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
up behind that you don't want so

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.870 
up behind that you don't want so
remember<00:02:45.180> these<00:02:45.810> fingers<00:02:46.770> here<00:02:47.070> come<00:02:47.760> down

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
remember these fingers here come down

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.970 
remember these fingers here come down
and<00:02:48.090> rests<00:02:48.480> lightly<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.290> strings<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.770> stop

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
and rests lightly on the strings to stop

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.650 
and rests lightly on the strings to stop
any<00:02:50.190> noise<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.910> movement<00:02:51.000> back<00:02:51.360> here<00:02:51.540> behind

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
any noise and movement back here behind

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.949 
any noise and movement back here behind
they<00:02:52.470> also<00:02:52.620> want<00:02:52.860> me<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.040> touch<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.660> guitar

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
they also want me to touch the guitar

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.949 
they also want me to touch the guitar
and<00:02:55.080> feel<00:02:55.410> where<00:02:55.650> you're<00:02:55.739> out<00:02:55.769> on<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> neck

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.140 

that's<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.170> essentially<00:03:01.980> when<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.910> come<00:03:03.120> down

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that's it essentially when you come down

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.440 
that's it essentially when you come down
remember<00:03:03.660> come<00:03:04.440> down<00:03:04.590> lightly<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.239> bring

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
remember come down lightly and bring

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.300 
remember come down lightly and bring
these<00:03:06.660> fingers<00:03:07.050> down<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.010> little<00:03:08.040> bit

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
these fingers down just a little bit

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.130 
these fingers down just a little bit
before<00:03:08.959> your<00:03:09.959> slide<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:11.900> develop<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.959> light

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
before your slide and develop a light

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.710 
before your slide and develop a light
touch<00:03:13.380> generally<00:03:13.920> also<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.820> usually<00:03:15.300> don't

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
touch generally also you usually don't

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.910 
touch generally also you usually don't
want<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.959> if<00:03:16.080> that's<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.440> note<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.709> want<00:03:16.860> to

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
want it if that's the note you want to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.550 
want it if that's the note you want to
play<00:03:17.100> say<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.450> third<00:03:18.959> position<00:03:19.140> there

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
play say on that third position there

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
play say on that third position there
you<00:03:19.680> usually<00:03:19.860> don't<00:03:20.220> want<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.459> come<00:03:21.329> down<00:03:21.480> like

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
you usually don't want to come down like

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.020 
you usually don't want to come down like
that<00:03:21.810> straight<00:03:22.110> onto<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.010> rather<00:03:23.190> slide

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
that straight onto it but rather slide

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.670 
that straight onto it but rather slide
down<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.570> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.470 

so<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:32.950> light<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.430> light<00:03:33.489> touch<00:03:34.030> with<00:03:34.330> your

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
so it's a light a light touch with your

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.720 
so it's a light a light touch with your
fingers<00:03:34.780> behind<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:38.340> sliding<00:03:39.340> up<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
fingers behind and sliding up to the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.610 
fingers behind and sliding up to the
note<00:03:39.910> rather<00:03:40.120> than<00:03:40.360> doing<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.319> tune<00:03:41.500> all

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
note rather than doing this tune all

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.339 
note rather than doing this tune all
that<00:03:42.250> sort<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.519> thing<00:03:42.640> all<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.790> time<00:03:43.349> okay

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
that sort of thing all the time okay

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.580 
that sort of thing all the time okay
good<00:03:45.250> luck<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.549> that
