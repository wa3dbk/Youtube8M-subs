this<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> particularly<00:00:21.689> interesting<00:00:22.199> game

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
this is a particularly interesting game

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.720 
this is a particularly interesting game
because<00:00:23.070> he<00:00:23.340> does<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> very<00:00:24.380> cheeky<00:00:25.730> dirty

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
because he does a very cheeky dirty

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.390 
because he does a very cheeky dirty
build<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.900> he<00:00:27.990> actually<00:00:28.140> execute<00:00:28.800> very<00:00:29.130> well

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
build that he actually execute very well

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.959 
build that he actually execute very well
and<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.210> makes<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.689> an<00:00:31.340> interesting<00:00:32.340> terran

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
and it makes for an interesting terran

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.959 
and it makes for an interesting terran
vs<00:00:33.300> terran<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.500> say<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> least<00:00:34.820> action<00:00:35.820> packed

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
vs terran to say the least action packed

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.229 
vs terran to say the least action packed
game<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.770> i<00:00:37.770> thought<00:00:38.070> i<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:39.059> an

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
game and i thought i would do an

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
game and i thought i would do an
analysis<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> give<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.890> guys<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
analysis on it and give you guys a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.479 
analysis on it and give you guys a
little<00:00:41.520> bit<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.790> insight<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:43.040> how<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> hold

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
little bit of insight as to how to hold

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940 
little bit of insight as to how to hold
off<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.210> early<00:00:46.140> cheese<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.649> terran

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
off some of this early cheese and terran

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.340 
off some of this early cheese and terran
vs<00:00:47.190> terran<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:48.239> very<00:00:48.660> common<00:00:49.170> these<00:00:49.200> days

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
vs terran it's very common these days

people matchup against me they will just

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.760 
people matchup against me they will just
choose<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.350> want<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> get

of people play on the ladder strictly to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
of people play on the ladder strictly to
win<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.610> look<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> end<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> game

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
before the 10-minute mark and as you can

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.789 
before the 10-minute mark and as you can
see<00:01:22.460> or<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:24.750> strategy<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.710> he<00:01:25.860> employs<00:01:26.189> is

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
see or this strategy that he employs is

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.109 
see or this strategy that he employs is
directly<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.340> relate<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:29.909> I'm

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
directly to relate it to what I'm

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
directly to relate it to what I'm
talking<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.960> most<00:01:31.560> definitely<00:01:31.799> trying

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
talking about is most definitely trying

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.600 
talking about is most definitely trying

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
mark whether he does it is purely up to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
mark whether he does it is purely up to
execution<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> tell<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.880> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
execution but I can tell you that this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
execution but I can tell you that this
strategy<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.899> he's<00:01:43.140> using<00:01:43.619> works<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> lot

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
strategy that he's using works for a lot

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240 
strategy that he's using works for a lot
of<00:01:44.880> Terrans<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:46.110> happens<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.590> Terran<00:01:46.890> return<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
of Terrans it happens in Terran return a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.700 
of Terrans it happens in Terran return a
lot<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.259> does<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
lot now and the way he does it is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.670 
lot now and the way he does it is
particularly<00:01:50.399> interesting<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.680> he's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
particularly interesting so he's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
particularly interesting so he's
actually<00:01:52.950> building<00:01:53.549> his<00:01:53.729> second<00:01:54.270> barracks

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
is natural I checked the Xel'Naga tower

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.860 
is natural I checked the Xel'Naga tower
in<00:02:22.860> mid<00:02:23.160> just<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.239> anything's<00:02:24.630> going

on I also send my SED up here and down

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.589 
on I also send my SED up here and down
here<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> two<00:02:31.950> other<00:02:32.160> main<00:02:32.400> basis<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.150> to

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
here to the two other main basis just to

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.570 
here to the two other main basis just to
see<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.959> there's<00:02:34.140> any<00:02:34.290> kind<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.620> proxying

see if there's any kind of proxying

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.640 
see if there's any kind of proxying
going<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.300> did<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.720> think<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:37.170> check<00:02:37.470> his

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
going on I did not think of check his

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.130 
going on I did not think of check his
natural<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> mistake<00:02:38.900> maybe<00:02:39.900> next

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
natural that was a mistake maybe next

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
natural that was a mistake maybe next
time<00:02:40.410> when<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> smell<00:02:41.040> something<00:02:41.280> fishy<00:02:41.550> is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
time when I smell something fishy is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.089 
time when I smell something fishy is
going<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.420> will<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.620> he<00:02:43.860> actually

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
going on I will do this he actually

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.880 
going on I will do this he actually
lifts<00:02:45.030> off<00:02:45.239> these<00:02:45.810> r<00:02:45.840> axes<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.709> he's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
lifts off these r axes that he's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
lifts off these r axes that he's
building<00:02:47.370> here's<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.090> third<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.940> fourth<00:02:50.940> rack

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
building here's a third and fourth rack

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.300 
building here's a third and fourth rack
so<00:02:51.660> he<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.959> actually<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.860> four

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so he is actually going for four

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.890 
so he is actually going for four
barracks<00:02:54.180> very<00:02:54.810> early<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> game<00:02:55.680> I

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
barracks very early on in the game I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.960 
barracks very early on in the game I
myself<00:02:57.900> has<00:02:58.260> just<00:02:58.799> put<00:02:58.950> up<00:02:59.040> my<00:02:59.160> factory<00:02:59.730> and

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
myself has just put up my factory and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.030 
myself has just put up my factory and
I'm<00:03:00.030> continuing<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> produce<00:03:00.930> marines<00:03:01.620> off<00:03:01.830> my

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
I'm continuing to produce marines off my

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.559 
I'm continuing to produce marines off my
initial<00:03:02.569> barracks<00:03:03.569> I<00:03:03.900> knew<00:03:04.680> something<00:03:05.069> was<00:03:05.280> up

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
initial barracks I knew something was up

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.539 
initial barracks I knew something was up
so<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.599> decided<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.140> throw<00:03:07.349> down<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> bunker<00:03:08.130> just

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
so I decided to throw down a bunker just

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.580 
so I decided to throw down a bunker just
to<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.760> safe<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.840> kinds<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.349> signs

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
to be safe because all kinds of signs

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.020 
to be safe because all kinds of signs
were<00:03:10.890> going<00:03:11.130> off<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.459> my<00:03:11.489> head<00:03:11.790> that

were going off in my head that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.759 
were going off in my head that
something's<00:03:12.390> wrong<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.959> had<00:03:13.080> never<00:03:13.380> seen<00:03:13.739> a

something's wrong I had never seen a

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.530 
something's wrong I had never seen a
build<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.430> before<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.819> knew<00:03:15.209> something

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.260 
factory and I did this so that i can get
the<00:04:02.989> tech<00:04:03.230> lab<00:04:03.440> on<00:04:03.709> my<00:04:03.890> starboard<00:04:04.430> as<00:04:04.670> soon<00:04:05.120> as

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
the tech lab on my starboard as soon as

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.360 
the tech lab on my starboard as soon as
possible<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.020> get<00:04:06.560> this<00:04:06.739> Banshee<00:04:07.040> out

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
possible and get this Banshee out

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.800 
possible and get this Banshee out
because<00:04:07.580> i<00:04:07.670> knew<00:04:07.940> something<00:04:08.330> was<00:04:08.450> going<00:04:08.630> on

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
because i knew something was going on

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.150 
because i knew something was going on
that's<00:04:09.110> why<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.260> built<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.620> bunker<00:04:09.800> at<00:04:10.070> the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
that's why I built this bunker at the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.009 
that's why I built this bunker at the
front<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.640> was<00:04:11.030> really<00:04:11.239> worried<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.810> wanted

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
front I was really worried and I wanted

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.140 
front I was really worried and I wanted
to<00:04:12.080> get<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> banshee<00:04:12.530> out<00:04:12.800> because<00:04:13.130> I<00:04:13.340> knew<00:04:13.940> he

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
to get a banshee out because I knew he

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.060 
to get a banshee out because I knew he
didn't<00:04:14.420> have<00:04:14.450> any<00:04:14.810> gas<00:04:15.110> when<00:04:15.500> I<00:04:15.530> scouted<00:04:15.890> him

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
didn't have any gas when I scouted him

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.610 
didn't have any gas when I scouted him
so<00:04:16.730> obviously<00:04:17.209> he's<00:04:17.450> up<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.690> no<00:04:17.810> good<00:04:17.840> he<00:04:18.470> in

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
