stuff up it will crack and really
accelerate<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> rusting<00:00:18.660> process<00:00:18.840> inside

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740

motorcycle tank as you can see I've got
some<00:00:47.010> pretty<00:00:47.190> significant<00:00:47.820> rust<00:00:48.090> problems

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
some pretty significant rust problems

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.819

don't<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.989> guys<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.649> there

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
don't know if you guys can see in there

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.510 
don't know if you guys can see in there
but<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.309> pretty<00:00:50.520> rusty<00:00:50.790> in<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:52.489> see<00:00:53.489> all

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
but it's pretty rusty in here see all

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
but it's pretty rusty in here see all
that<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.660> rust<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> first<00:00:56.280> thing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that that's just all rust so first thing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
that that's just all rust so first thing
I'll<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.700> if<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> clean<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.719> tank

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I'll do if I want to clean out this tank

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.869 
I'll do if I want to clean out this tank
rather<00:00:58.620> than<00:00:58.800> use<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.370> boric

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
rather than use something like boric

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
rather than use something like boric
acid<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.930> dangerous<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.739> bad

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
acid which is really dangerous and bad

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
acid which is really dangerous and bad
for<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> environment<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.439> possibly<00:01:04.439> burn

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
for the environment and possibly burn

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.069 
for the environment and possibly burn
holes<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> what's<00:01:05.579> left<00:01:05.819> of<00:01:05.969> your<00:01:06.090> tank<00:01:06.389> I<00:01:06.600> like

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
holes in what's left of your tank I like

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.830 
holes in what's left of your tank I like
to<00:01:07.200> use<00:01:07.319> this<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.619> simple<00:01:08.069> method<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
to use this really simple method and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.789 
to use this really simple method and
first<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:09.959> I'll<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.319> I'll<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.499> do<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
first what I'll do is I'll just do a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.039 
first what I'll do is I'll just do a
general<00:01:11.159> impression<00:01:11.509> look<00:01:12.509> around<00:01:12.779> see<00:01:13.020> if

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
general impression look around see if

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.109 
general impression look around see if
any<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.529> these<00:01:13.679> seams<00:01:14.039> are<00:01:14.310> coming<00:01:14.609> apart<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
any of these seams are coming apart you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.139
