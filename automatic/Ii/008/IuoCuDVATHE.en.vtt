00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.370
 customized in the store 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.490
 site which is called the sims 3 rhesus that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.490
 here I must tell the truth that they are 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:31.920
 many things and now to give an example 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:40.739
 I just want to download this dress 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 for toddler on crown load then it will come out 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.190
 a screen that will take ten 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.579
 seconds 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.579

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:19.670

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.000
