00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.530
 she 9 used another video he them 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.030
 business is one of 16 events that this 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.030
 I'm going to school stuff 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.370
 First of all I 'm not feeling 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.140
 because I would already betray not announced the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:44.769
 suitcase I have a more classic style 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:47.489
 so be it but first is a style 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:01:03.670
 and I like to use because increased 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:06.760
 school, only the son to the school, so I 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:12.580
 even though the main question 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.920
 so I need the cars in 1969 for 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.070
 I bought at the end of the year or 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:28.090
 Only I 'm leaving because I was at home. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:37.450
 she had not only mine but of 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:39.250
 Plastic is feasible my leaves on it 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:49.980
 so I stayed with her just thinking about 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:49.980
 house and crossed well fininha 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.830
 then it is not so modern that it is too 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.520
 easier pro Vargas on a daily basis 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 because most simple but when 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.730
 I only have some things here and it stays 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 much easier at home 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:10.790
 in the beginning the pieces of the company because I 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.510
 really do not know the prices but others 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:19.780
 do not know 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.780
 so I will not say I did not have 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:35.320
 no decision even for this same time 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:03:55.870
 then her schedule here is good all 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:55.870
 makeup so I'm 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.030
 because when we work with 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.790
 books all oil books and so I like 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.680
 to listen to the folders on pages with 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.710
 these things because the subject after 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.820
 tests and body 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:20.720
 then I bought the pages because the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.760
 easy way to bookmark 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.780
 of all one of the disciplines of everything 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.860
 book pages that have already been so 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.880
 first in the list 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.230
 so I have bought this was 89 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:44.660
 service 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:54.880
 I'm sure it's also super 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:05:01.960
 fluffy little balls of tv and blue super cute 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:04.960
 I bought two schools at the time of 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.960
 average 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:21.770
 something because I really like 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:06:07.640
 talk about getting writings so always 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:06:18.820
 and I only use the area and then I have 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:18.820
 here is much more 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:07:20.810
 I finally have these 500 things because 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:23.200
 use is the same because for everything then it is 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.200
 that
