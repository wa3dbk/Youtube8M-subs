00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.059 

before<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.019> start<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.349> left<00:02:13.590> side<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.799> always

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
before I start my left side I always

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.890 
before I start my left side I always
spray<00:02:14.370> my<00:02:14.489> hair<00:02:14.670> using<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> Loreal<00:02:15.629> hair

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.869 

so<00:02:28.170> again<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:28.769> gonna<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.129> close-up<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.700> how

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850 
I do the left side the curls always
going<00:02:32.610> away<00:02:32.849> from<00:02:33.060> my<00:02:33.150> face<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.720> never<00:02:34.590> liked

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
going away from my face I never liked

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
going away from my face I never liked
the<00:02:35.010> curls<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:36.000> because<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.569> looks

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the curls going in because it looks

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.039 
the curls going in because it looks
weird<00:02:37.440> doesn't<00:02:37.709> look<00:02:38.040> even<00:02:38.569> one<00:02:39.569> thing<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.870> also

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
weird doesn't look even one thing I also

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.080 
weird doesn't look even one thing I also
like<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.709> I'd<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.010> hold<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.849> curl

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
like to do is I'd like to hold the curl

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
like to do is I'd like to hold the curl
in<00:02:42.239> place<00:02:42.540> right<00:02:42.780> after<00:02:42.959> curling<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.280> that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
in place right after curling it so that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.759 
in place right after curling it so that
it<00:02:44.549> sets<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.360> bit<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.900> curl<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.530> not

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
it sets a little bit in the curl and not

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.140 
it sets a little bit in the curl and not
down<00:02:47.040> straight<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.879> doesn't

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
down straight so that it doesn't

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.860 
down straight so that it doesn't
straighten<00:02:48.420> after<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.349> curl<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> I'll<00:02:51.629> do<00:02:51.810> a

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
straighten after I curl it so I'll do a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.660 
straighten after I curl it so I'll do a
couple<00:02:52.200> more<00:02:52.349> curls<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.890> then<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.220> will<00:02:53.489> fast

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
couple more curls and then I will fast

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:56.930 
couple more curls and then I will fast
forward

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.880 

so<00:03:57.540> once<00:03:57.840> you're<00:03:58.020> done<00:03:58.050> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.620> what<00:03:58.770> the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
so once you're done this is what the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.190 
so once you're done this is what the
curls<00:03:59.250> will<00:03:59.430> look<00:03:59.580> like<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.120> don't<00:04:00.750> really<00:04:00.930> like

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
curls will look like I don't really like

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.160 
curls will look like I don't really like
the<00:04:01.350> whole<00:04:01.560> separated<00:04:02.220> look<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.300> what<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.540> do<00:04:03.660> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
the whole separated look so what I do is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.550 
the whole separated look so what I do is
I<00:04:04.410> like<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.680> run<00:04:05.160> my<00:04:05.190> fingers<00:04:05.910> through<00:04:06.270> my<00:04:06.390> hair

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
I like to run my fingers through my hair

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.170 
I like to run my fingers through my hair
so<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.800> curls<00:04:08.070> separate<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.850> gives<00:04:09.060> me

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
so the curls separate and it gives me

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.820 
so the curls separate and it gives me
more<00:04:09.450> volume<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.200> gives<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:10.500> more<00:04:10.770> of

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
more volume and it gives you more of

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.780 
more volume and it gives you more of
that<00:04:11.000> Victoria<00:04:12.000> Secret<00:04:12.450> voluminous<00:04:13.370> curls<00:04:14.370> in

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that Victoria Secret voluminous curls in
