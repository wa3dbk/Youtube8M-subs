mean what what is happening I think

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.610 
mean what what is happening I think
Dom's<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.140> at<00:01:54.260> best<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:56.479> screams<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.409> take

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
Dom's that at best we in screams we take

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.860 
Dom's that at best we in screams we take
those<00:01:57.799> 5050<00:01:58.370> situations<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.690> go<00:01:59.840> for

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
those 5050 situations and we just go for

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.969 
those 5050 situations and we just go for
it<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:01.040> LCS<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.120> guess<00:02:02.299> we<00:02:02.450> kind<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.920> get<00:02:03.920> a

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
it but in LCS I guess we kind of get a

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.200 
it but in LCS I guess we kind of get a
little<00:02:04.100> nervous<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.790> we<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.030> play

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
little nervous and we just play

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.780 
little nervous and we just play
extremely<00:02:05.540> safe<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.440> think<00:02:06.680> today's<00:02:07.490> game

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
extremely safe and I think today's game

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.630 
extremely safe and I think today's game
was<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.060> first<00:02:08.509> time<00:02:08.690> where<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:08.959> actually

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
was the first time where we actually

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.370 
was the first time where we actually
took<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.819> risk<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.510> went<00:02:11.720> pretty

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
took the risk and we just went pretty

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.570 
took the risk and we just went pretty
hard<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:12.770> one<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.010> our<00:02:13.100> players

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
hard with one of our players

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500 
hard with one of our players
like<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.180> flash<00:02:15.490> cocoon<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.850> Java<00:02:17.210> Jo

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
pretty much started it off and then we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.770 
pretty much started it off and then we

the big thing against the comp that
they're<00:03:06.440> running<00:03:06.800> was<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.520> not<00:03:07.670> let<00:03:07.910> them

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090

it talk to me a little bit about your
comp<00:03:27.620> because<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:28.130> seemed<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.670> guys

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
comp because it seemed like you guys

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.759 
comp because it seemed like you guys
were<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.540> tanky<00:03:30.200> by<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.380> end<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.680> that

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
were just so tanky by the end of that

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.090 
were just so tanky by the end of that
like<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:31.400> think<00:03:32.470> Kobe<00:03:33.470> said<00:03:33.680> something<00:03:33.980> like

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
like I think Kobe said something like

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.340 
like I think Kobe said something like
there's<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.400> all<00:03:34.820> these<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.510> know

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
there's just all these like you know

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.020 
there's just all these like you know
beefcakes<00:03:36.950> essentially<00:03:37.459> running<00:03:37.670> around

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
beefcakes essentially running around

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.600 
beefcakes essentially running around
nobody<00:03:38.870> can<00:03:39.140> get<00:03:39.320> died<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.769> bra<00:03:40.010> bra<00:03:40.400> was

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
nobody can get died like bra bra was

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.310 
nobody can get died like bra bra was
sitting<00:03:40.940> out<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.090> front<00:03:41.209> like<00:03:41.690> taking<00:03:42.140> stuff

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
sitting out in front like taking stuff

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.410 
sitting out in front like taking stuff
was<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.340> intentional<00:03:43.610> like<00:03:44.120> did<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.390> guys

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
was that intentional like did you guys

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.880 
was that intentional like did you guys
just<00:03:44.540> go<00:03:44.810> for<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.140> like<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:45.530> can't<00:03:45.709> kill<00:03:45.860> us

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
just go for this like you can't kill us

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.220 
just go for this like you can't kill us
comp<00:03:46.400> because<00:03:46.670> you're<00:03:46.970> like<00:03:47.120> we<00:03:47.870> always<00:03:48.019> get

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
comp because you're like we always get

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.710 
comp because you're like we always get
killed<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.190> will<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:49.430> not<00:03:49.670> die<00:03:49.850> where

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
killed and so will just not die where

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.410 
killed and so will just not die where
their<00:03:50.810> first<00:03:51.050> two<00:03:51.260> picks<00:03:51.500> Jackson<00:03:52.280> Lee<00:03:52.430> sin<00:03:52.670> I

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
their first two picks Jackson Lee sin I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.030 
their first two picks Jackson Lee sin I
actually<00:03:53.600> forget<00:03:53.959> what<00:03:54.110> their<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.290> got<00:03:54.830> here

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
actually forget what their I got here

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.490 
actually forget what their I got here
too<00:03:55.250> late<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.610> see<00:03:55.790> them<00:03:56.050> they<00:03:57.050> first<00:03:57.350> pick

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
too late to see them they first pick

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.680 
too late to see them they first pick
jags<00:03:57.739> Lee<00:03:57.920> sin<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.519> we<00:03:58.880> add<00:03:59.000> Lucian<00:03:59.420> then<00:03:59.570> we

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
jags Lee sin and we add Lucian then we

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.830 
jags Lee sin and we add Lucian then we
picked<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:01.060> don't<00:04:02.060> think<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.239> picked<00:04:02.420> Brom<00:04:02.660> I

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
picked a I don't think I picked Brom I

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.860 
picked a I don't think I picked Brom I
think<00:04:03.019> we<00:04:03.080> were<00:04:03.170> just<00:04:03.290> like<00:04:03.940> take<00:04:04.940> acid<00:04:05.420> in<00:04:05.540> and

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
think we were just like take acid in and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.229 
think we were just like take acid in and
take<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.260> lease<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:07.640> because<00:04:07.850> we<00:04:07.880> wanted<00:04:08.120> to

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
take a lease just because we wanted to

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.850 
take a lease just because we wanted to
hold<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.540> support<00:04:08.840> pic<00:04:08.959> we<00:04:09.140> had<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.530> guess

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
hold the support pic we had I guess

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.100 
hold the support pic we had I guess
something<00:04:10.250> ready<00:04:10.400> for<00:04:10.610> prom<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.390> don't

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
something ready for prom but I don't

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.180 
something ready for prom but I don't
think<00:04:12.170> we<00:04:12.290> wanted<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.560> leave<00:04:12.709> up<00:04:12.830> Cass<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
think we wanted to leave up Cass and

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.490 
think we wanted to leave up Cass and
again<00:04:13.519> plus<00:04:14.330> they<00:04:14.450> have<00:04:14.540> last<00:04:14.690> pic<00:04:14.900> anyways<00:04:15.230> so

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
again plus they have last pic anyways so

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.710 
again plus they have last pic anyways so
we're<00:04:15.739> not<00:04:15.830> going<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.100> counter<00:04:16.880> pick<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.660> we

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
we're not going to counter pick it so we

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.979 
we're not going to counter pick it so we
just<00:04:17.840> took<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:19.660> pretty<00:04:20.660> much<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.959> only

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
just took it and pretty much the only

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.140 
just took it and pretty much the only
cast<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.650> build<00:04:22.039> right<00:04:22.250> now<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.789> just<00:04:22.820> full

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
cast and build right now is just full

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.510 
cast and build right now is just full
tank<00:04:23.450> where<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.440> built<00:04:24.620> frozen<00:04:24.979> fist<00:04:25.250> and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
tank where they built frozen fist and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.830 
tank where they built frozen fist and
then<00:04:25.669> whatever<00:04:26.240> else

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
then whatever else

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.189 
then whatever else
there<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:28.090> at<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.300> end<00:04:29.449> when<00:04:29.630> we<00:04:29.750> saw<00:04:29.960> their

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
there and at the end when we saw their

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.020 
there and at the end when we saw their
comp<00:04:30.470> which<00:04:30.710> was<00:04:30.889> like<00:04:31.160> Jax<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.310> pretty<00:04:34.550> 80

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
comp which was like Jax is a pretty 80

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.020 
comp which was like Jax is a pretty 80
physical<00:04:35.750> heavy<00:04:35.930> comp<00:04:36.229> so<00:04:36.830> we<00:04:36.949> just<00:04:37.130> picked

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
physical heavy comp so we just picked

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.360 
physical heavy comp so we just picked
her<00:04:38.120> nekton<00:04:38.419> just<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.830> balance<00:04:39.830> out<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.160> lanes

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
her nekton just to balance out the lanes

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.189 
her nekton just to balance out the lanes
with<00:04:40.580> Kassadin<00:04:41.030> we<00:04:41.270> want<00:04:41.449> two<00:04:41.690> strong<00:04:41.960> lanes

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
with Kassadin we want two strong lanes

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.930 
with Kassadin we want two strong lanes
and<00:04:42.470> then<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.040> chasm<00:04:43.400> lane<00:04:43.550> so<00:04:43.699> we<00:04:43.790> at<00:04:43.880> least

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
and then the chasm lane so we at least

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.409 
and then the chasm lane so we at least
have<00:04:44.210> some<00:04:44.419> sort<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.660> pressure<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:46.270> yeah<00:04:47.270> we

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
have some sort of pressure and yeah we

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.439 
have some sort of pressure and yeah we
just<00:04:48.430> with<00:04:49.430> those<00:04:49.610> pics<00:04:49.850> we<00:04:50.090> could<00:04:50.300> build

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
just with those pics we could build

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.719 
just with those pics we could build
armor<00:04:50.840> if<00:04:50.960> we<00:04:51.169> got<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.800> lead<00:04:52.040> somehow<00:04:52.430> and

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
armor if we got a lead somehow and

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.330 
armor if we got a lead somehow and
getting<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.600> lead<00:04:53.810> allowed<00:04:54.080> us<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.250> pick<00:04:55.250> up

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
getting that lead allowed us to pick up

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.640 
getting that lead allowed us to pick up
Rand<00:04:55.580> ones<00:04:55.790> I<00:04:55.850> never<00:04:56.030> on<00:04:56.300> everybody<00:04:56.630> now<00:04:57.530> you

until win like when is the when do you
get<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.860> use<00:05:09.979> it<00:05:10.010> again<00:05:10.340> I'm<00:05:11.030> think<00:05:11.840> it's<00:05:12.020> just

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
get to use it again I'm think it's just

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.330 
get to use it again I'm think it's just
going<00:05:12.260> to<00:05:12.290> be<00:05:12.380> permanent<00:05:12.889> I<00:05:13.040> think<00:05:13.250> it's

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
going to be permanent I think it's

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.340 
going to be permanent I think it's
pretty<00:05:13.700> good<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.450> do<00:05:14.570> that<00:05:14.750> just<00:05:14.930> because<00:05:15.139> some

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
pretty good to do that just because some

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.520 
pretty good to do that just because some
people<00:05:15.650> are<00:05:15.910> affected<00:05:16.910> more<00:05:17.180> than<00:05:17.240> others

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
people are affected more than others

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.740 
people are affected more than others
based<00:05:18.530> on<00:05:18.680> like<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:19.120> any<00:05:20.120> hate<00:05:20.479> mail<00:05:20.510> they

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
based on like a any hate mail they

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.080 
based on like a any hate mail they
receive<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.380> it's<00:05:22.190> like<00:05:22.490> after<00:05:22.639> a<00:05:22.789> game<00:05:22.940> you

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
receive so it's like after a game you

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.400 
receive so it's like after a game you
lose<00:05:23.300> it's<00:05:23.479> like<00:05:23.600> oh<00:05:23.690> let<00:05:23.900> me<00:05:23.930> check<00:05:23.990> Twitter

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
lose it's like oh let me check Twitter

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.350 
lose it's like oh let me check Twitter
go<00:05:24.949> kill<00:05:25.130> yourself<00:05:25.490> it's<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:25.820> yeah<00:05:26.150> that

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
go kill yourself it's like yeah that

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.540 
go kill yourself it's like yeah that
might<00:05:26.479> make<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.020> play<00:05:27.229> pretty<00:05:27.410> bad<00:05:27.590> so<00:05:28.039> you

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
might make you play pretty bad so you

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.969 
might make you play pretty bad so you
know<00:05:28.699> I<00:05:29.180> want<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:29.960> point<00:05:30.110> out<00:05:30.289> some<00:05:30.530> like<00:05:30.889> a

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
know I want to point out some like a

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.740 
know I want to point out some like a
discrepancy<00:05:31.340> I've<00:05:31.729> noticed<00:05:32.060> is<00:05:32.210> that<00:05:32.240> earlier

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
discrepancy I've noticed is that earlier

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.050 
discrepancy I've noticed is that earlier
in<00:05:32.840> this<00:05:32.960> interview<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:34.370> said<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.789> you<00:05:34.880> woke

these tweets but now you're telling me

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.290 
these tweets but now you're telling me
you<00:05:42.710> know<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:43.010> you<00:05:43.099> didn't<00:05:43.400> use<00:05:44.060> social

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
you know that you didn't use social

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.379 
you know that you didn't use social
media<00:05:44.479> so<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.520> was<00:05:46.520> hoping<00:05:46.700> you<00:05:47.000> could<00:05:47.030> clarify

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
media so I was hoping you could clarify

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.219 
media so I was hoping you could clarify
to<00:05:47.690> me<00:05:47.870> how<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:48.200> worked<00:05:48.440> out<00:05:48.590> I<00:05:48.940> cheat<00:05:49.940> I

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
to me how this worked out I cheat I

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.020 
to me how this worked out I cheat I
still<00:05:51.229> look<00:05:51.410> sometimes<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:52.250> think<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:52.880> main

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
still look sometimes I think the main

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.170 
still look sometimes I think the main
thing<00:05:53.090> is<00:05:53.330> don't<00:05:53.780> look<00:05:54.080> after<00:05:54.470> a<00:05:54.500> loss<00:05:54.830> or<00:05:55.280> when

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
thing is don't look after a loss or when

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.600 
thing is don't look after a loss or when
like<00:05:56.360> something<00:05:56.750> bad<00:05:56.960> happens<00:05:57.440> just<00:05:58.310> because

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
like something bad happens just because

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.150 
like something bad happens just because
you're<00:05:58.970> yeah<00:05:59.900> what's<00:06:00.289> going<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.530> be<00:06:00.650> in<00:06:00.680> in

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
you're yeah what's going to be in in

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.860 
you're yeah what's going to be in in
your<00:06:01.310> twitter<00:06:01.520> feed<00:06:01.610> is<00:06:01.789> people<00:06:02.510> hating<00:06:02.780> on

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
your twitter feed is people hating on

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.080 
your twitter feed is people hating on
you<00:06:03.050> so<00:06:03.410> i<00:06:03.680> think<00:06:04.099> after<00:06:04.280> looking<00:06:04.639> after<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:04.910> win

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
you so i think after looking after a win

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.730 
you so i think after looking after a win
like<00:06:05.300> today<00:06:05.599> i'll<00:06:05.870> probably<00:06:06.139> check<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.590> out

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
like today i'll probably check it out

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.650 
like today i'll probably check it out
just<00:06:07.220> because<00:06:07.400> that's<00:06:07.729> when<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.360> fans<00:06:08.570> come

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
just because that's when the fans come

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.940 
just because that's when the fans come
out<00:06:08.840> and<00:06:08.990> support<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:09.320> and<00:06:09.410> say<00:06:09.560> like<00:06:09.830> you

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
out and support you and say like you

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.820 
out and support you and say like you
played<00:06:10.160> really<00:06:10.280> well<00:06:10.400> and<00:06:11.260> it's<00:06:12.260> try<00:06:12.560> not<00:06:12.710> to

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
played really well and it's try not to

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.730 
played really well and it's try not to
look<00:06:13.070> when<00:06:13.280> you<00:06:13.430> expect<00:06:13.880> bad<00:06:14.090> things<00:06:14.740> fair

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
look when you expect bad things fair

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.120 
look when you expect bad things fair
enough<00:06:15.919> hey<00:06:16.700> a<00:06:16.729> final<00:06:17.479> question<00:06:17.870> here<00:06:18.349> i<00:06:18.500> just

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
enough hey a final question here i just

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.920 
enough hey a final question here i just
saw<00:06:19.220> an<00:06:19.310> eighty-six<00:06:19.789> percent<00:06:19.880> vote<00:06:20.300> for<00:06:20.510> TSM

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
saw an eighty-six percent vote for TSM

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.770 
saw an eighty-six percent vote for TSM
over<00:06:21.139> complexity<00:06:22.030> do<00:06:23.030> you<00:06:23.120> think<00:06:23.389> that<00:06:23.660> that's

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
over complexity do you think that that's

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.469 
over complexity do you think that that's
you<00:06:24.260> know<00:06:24.380> a<00:06:24.590> fair<00:06:24.979> number<00:06:25.190> is<00:06:25.820> low<00:06:26.030> codelco

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
you know a fair number is low codelco

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.750 
you know a fair number is low codelco
just<00:06:26.690> that<00:06:26.810> good<00:06:26.990> um<00:06:27.889> TSM<00:06:28.400> looked<00:06:28.580> really

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
just that good um TSM looked really

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.060 
just that good um TSM looked really
strong<00:06:29.120> yesterday<00:06:29.360> so<00:06:29.630> i<00:06:29.870> think<00:06:30.080> they've

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
strong yesterday so i think they've

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.300 
strong yesterday so i think they've
earned<00:06:31.400> that<00:06:31.639> percentage<00:06:32.419> plus<00:06:32.720> there<00:06:33.310> they

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
earned that percentage plus there they

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.409 
earned that percentage plus there they
have<00:06:34.430> like<00:06:34.580> one<00:06:34.700> of<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.849> biggest<00:06:34.969> fan<00:06:35.210> bases

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
have like one of the biggest fan bases

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.270 
have like one of the biggest fan bases
of<00:06:35.810> course<00:06:36.020> they're<00:06:36.140> going<00:06:36.289> to<00:06:36.349> get<00:06:36.469> pretty

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
of course they're going to get pretty

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.170 
of course they're going to get pretty
much<00:06:37.430> a<00:06:37.490> higher<00:06:38.479> vote<00:06:38.750> every<00:06:39.260> game

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
much a higher vote every game

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.499 
much a higher vote every game
but<00:06:40.500> complexity<00:06:42.030> they've<00:06:43.030> shown<00:06:43.270> that<00:06:43.389> they

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
but complexity they've shown that they

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.600 
but complexity they've shown that they
can<00:06:43.690> they<00:06:44.259> can<00:06:44.289> shine<00:06:44.590> so<00:06:44.860> I<00:06:44.889> think<00:06:45.100> they<00:06:45.430> could

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
can they can shine so I think they could

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.740 
can they can shine so I think they could
maybe<00:06:46.229> be<00:06:47.229> the<00:06:47.320> underdogs<00:06:48.479> giving<00:06:49.479> shadows

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
maybe be the underdogs giving shadows

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.779 
maybe be the underdogs giving shadows
plugs<00:06:49.990> anything<00:06:50.410> you<00:06:50.500> would<00:06:50.650> like<00:06:50.680> to<00:06:50.800> say<00:06:51.130> to

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
plugs anything you would like to say to
