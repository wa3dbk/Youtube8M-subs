00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.660

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.189
 hello is cristian super duper ryan i am 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.760
 the wta and this video are of this autumn 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.040
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.540
 where I live and it 's a little bit cooler 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.080
 so you do you like or as 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.060
 for summer but not so for winter 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.510
 as in a balance of the two and 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.750
 ok this is first faith and in the first 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.330
 I'm wearing a button-up sweater 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.690
 great this I think I bought it in series 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.480
 and I have some combat boots that 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.970
 they call that I showed in the video of my 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.880
 October favorites some jeans and a 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.860
 belt that combine with my boots and these 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.440
 and in the fifth the boots are the ones 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.190
 I bring in each part in the second 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.010
 I bring a sweater that I think 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.860
 I bought on the fly but the point is that 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.320
 this is a little warmer hot 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.729
 and I have not wanted to like everything for the weather 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.970
 depends on how the weather is in your 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.090
 city ​​right now and that's what this is like 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.479
 afe whole and the third one to see I think I 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.090
 that is third in this I have from those 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.970
 shirts that are like patterns 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.619
 stripes or squares or whatever they are 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.060
 point is that if you're not with the shoes 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.440
 appropriate 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.790
 I think you can do it for the fall 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.130
 you do not have to leave the ladies to 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.590
 summer 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.190
 Beware of wearing sandals in dallas and 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.560
 they are not very autumns although they do not do much 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.440
 cold in your city but I think I do not read 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.840
 they do not serve also that is my little dog 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.550
 like to steal cameras and that's what it looks like 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.830
 do not do this you can deal with 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.650
 any type of shoe 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.430
 and this is the fourth do here I bring 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.740
 a long-sleeved blouse and a necklace and 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.480
 combat boots with these buttons 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.540
 very stylish but you do not have to use 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.180
 these notes are the ones you want 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.350
 antón that are the years already you know booties 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.230
 boots or black grays remain 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.080
 have to do but go to the wing 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 to the weather and good this Sunday to do 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.670
 I'm going to take a chew that's like 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.270
 in the form of a box and folded in half 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 now I'm going to roll it up in a 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.050
 role that I'm going to put around me 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.950
 neck and leave it from both ends the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.230
 arrangement 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.910
 under the mask and passarella you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.120
 hair I think that that gives you as a 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.129
 effect a more cool autumn look 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.690
 and this I really like that if 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.390
 shows how everything you can take your 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.250
 own style but as I say no 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.260
 you have to wear these boots because I know 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.569
 that you are if I did not realize if the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.930
 use for everyone because he walks in heels with 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.079
 that are cool and this is the fifth one in 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.510
 the fifth set I bring these boots and a 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.610
 destination mourning I really loved it 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.049
 because here I am like showing how 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.209
 You can wear the same dresses that 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.849
 you for summer but for autumn 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.980
 you can also transform nothing else 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.250
 you play with your accessories with your 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.959
 shoes and like that and as he said you do not have 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.049
 than using these boots you can use the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.269
 shoes that you create better with heels 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.980
 pimps like these only those who have 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.959
 one they do not have and that 's all for today is 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.140
 prioritize they have liked the outfits if you 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.790

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.959
