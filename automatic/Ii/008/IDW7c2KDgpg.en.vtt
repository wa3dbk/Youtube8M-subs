00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
thing but it could be very different so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270 
thing but it could be very different so

and yet as an artist you don't want to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
and yet as an artist you don't want to
leave<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.780> signature<00:00:46.350> people<00:00:46.739> should<00:00:46.950> never

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
but you should you should have a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
but you should you should have a
naturalness<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.680> there's<00:00:52.890> there's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.129> number

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
naturalness so there's there's a number

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.979 
naturalness so there's there's a number
of<00:00:53.430> key<00:00:53.610> things<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> things<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of key things and one of the things is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.389 
of key things and one of the things is
the<00:00:55.140> technique<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.860> people<00:00:56.160> talk<00:00:56.370> about

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the technique and people talk about

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
the technique and people talk about
Anatomy<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> time<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.960> brought<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
Anatomy all the time and I brought a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
Anatomy all the time and I brought a
little<00:00:58.680> profit<00:00:58.859> today<00:00:59.250> is<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.210> around<00:01:00.510> or

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
little profit today is this around or

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
little profit today is this around or
histogram<00:01:00.870> rep<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.370> sort

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
histogram rep is for and and it's sort

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.009 
histogram rep is for and and it's sort
of<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.480> skin<00:01:03.870> of

lifting under local anesthesia and

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.630 
lifting under local anesthesia and
you're<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.220> result

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you're not going to get the right result

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.130 
you're not going to get the right result
and<00:01:23.850> we're<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.119> naming<00:01:24.299> names<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.020> are

and we're not naming names but these are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
and we're not naming names but these are
popular<00:01:25.740> infomercials<00:01:26.430> you've<00:01:26.580> seen<00:01:26.820> them

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
popular infomercials you've seen them

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
popular infomercials you've seen them
where<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> face<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:28.080> than<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.500> skin

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
where the face is more than just skin

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.210 
where the face is more than just skin
its<00:01:29.640> muscle<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> end<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> fashion<00:01:31.740> layer

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
its muscle in the end as a fashion layer

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.190 
its muscle in the end as a fashion layer
there's<00:01:32.520> different<00:01:32.880> layers<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.049> we

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
there's different layers so so what we

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.499 
there's different layers so so what we
want<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.770> audience<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:36.090> from<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
want the audience to get from this is
