00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.950
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.390
 another workshop today we employ 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.760
 bind us with that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 the second strand of traders panse 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.900
 Generally, the tanks and the fans 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.900
 stood by becker already accustomed to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 However, after unpacking state 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.110
 there are difficulties 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.210
 possibility of reconnecting 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 Similarly, a bond is necessary if they 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
 individual components like that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.770
 remote control or direct shares board 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.890
 swap how it works that say 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 I now have fun doing them before 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.790
 I would like to do the actual binding process 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.870
 very briefly the current three 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:05.790
 Generations of England's landmark short 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 imagine and on some feature 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 point out the remote control of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 second generation is as a feature that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.060
 in the lower right two scholders 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.340
 are yours for the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.999
 volume control and anna for the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.490
 Smoker in charge of the understanding of 

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:31.999
 these are not the first generation 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999
 available 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.189
 that is why synonymous with the rx 18:04 gp 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.969
 from england of the first generation 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.850
 each still a slot for the 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:52.139
 volume control and the one 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.920
 switch for the smoker on the 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:54.920
 board installed 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:05.219
 at the second generation rx-8 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.160
 the jacks were left out there 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.300
 a switch off via the remote control 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.180
 takes place at the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.640
 rx 8 is 10 third generation 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 as well as the second generation 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.290
 the openings empty there as well at the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.030
 third generation the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.380
 volume control and it all 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.460
 Turn off the joker's over the 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.500
 window is very good indiz that 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.710
 get a rx 8 from the newest one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.450
 Generation has is this little stub 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:49.560
 antenna of the binding process itself, this 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.070
 for all three windows the same 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.880
 over the start button like the bandage 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.220
 Process initiated at the third 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.970
 Generation only differs 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:08.180
 the design but the function of 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.180
 start button for the binding is the same 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:17.310
 Most importantly, every board is just 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.040
 compatible with the respective windows 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.450
 that is the latest board 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.760
 Generation Generation 3 is only with the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.280
 remote control of the third generation 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.070
 compatible the same applies to the second 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.709
 and of course for the first 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.739
 there is no binding between each other 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.320
 possible i will show you now like you 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.730
 make the binder go by 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:49.320
 on the new hang lung windowsill 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:55.890
 third generation , we prepare first 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:04:02.160
 us either before and open the battery 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:10.380
 bay and connect 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:12.180
 a battery with a tank in the battery 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.190
 bay itself is in but the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.959
 Educational pot we will need later 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.959
 to make the actual education 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:30.970
 we turn on the remote control 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:33.530
 important signal light red that means 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.270
 Remote control is on and the 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.360
 Power supply fits in the windows 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.300
 the third generation is the city 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.539
 to see the head on the right side 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.539
 We need that to tie the tank 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:05:02.889
 in the next step we will see that 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:05.090
 panzer is turned on and press the 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.389
 Actual start button on the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:13.360
 Remote control and hold him too 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.360
 pressed and press 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.690
 possibly with a screwdriver 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:25.210
 start button the binding button on the tank 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.210
 short and in the immediately going again 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.099
 that was the device passed 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.690
 and now the remote control is Munich 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.690
 bound
