fertilization fertilization you talk

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.829 
fertilization fertilization you talk
about<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:05.910> with<00:00:06.000> all<00:00:06.120> kinds<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.450> things<00:00:06.600> but

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
about it with all kinds of things but

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.330 
about it with all kinds of things but
from<00:00:06.990> human<00:00:07.319> fertilization<00:00:07.589> we're<00:00:08.040> talking

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
from human fertilization we're talking

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.330 
from human fertilization we're talking
about<00:00:08.429> these<00:00:08.700> sperm<00:00:09.120> cell<00:00:09.480> meeting<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.590> egg

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
about these sperm cell meeting the egg

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.160 
about these sperm cell meeting the egg
cell

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
cell

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.570 
cell
so<00:00:13.170> sperm<00:00:13.469> cell<00:00:13.710> meeting<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.009> egg<00:00:14.160> cell<00:00:14.429> we're

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
so sperm cell meeting the egg cell we're

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
so sperm cell meeting the egg cell we're
talking<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:14.969> two<00:00:15.269> haploid<00:00:15.870> cells

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
talking about two haploid cells

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.330 
talking about two haploid cells
containing<00:00:17.060> 23<00:00:18.060> chromosomes<00:00:18.600> each<00:00:18.810> for

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
containing 23 chromosomes each for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.599 
containing 23 chromosomes each for
humans<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.580> combined<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.109> new

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
humans and combined to make a new

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.710 
humans and combined to make a new
genetically<00:00:23.609> unique<00:00:24.710> human<00:00:25.710> being<00:00:25.789> okay<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
genetically unique human being okay so a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.689 
genetically unique human being okay so a
couple<00:00:28.230> steps<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.769> arrival<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> sperm

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
couple steps right here arrival of sperm

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.160 
couple steps right here arrival of sperm
then<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> binding<00:00:30.300> something<00:00:30.929> called<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
then the binding something called the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.760 
then the binding something called the
acrosome<00:00:31.610> reaction<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.140> fusion<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.530> then

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
acrosome reaction and fusion and then

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.770 
acrosome reaction and fusion and then
something<00:00:35.190> called<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> cortical<00:00:36.120> reaction

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
something called the cortical reaction

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
something called the cortical reaction
and<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.860> finally<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> starts<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and then finally when it starts to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
and then finally when it starts to
divide<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.899> from<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> single<00:00:40.620> design<00:00:41.010> goat<00:00:41.250> into

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
divide at from a single design goat into

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
divide at from a single design goat into
multiple<00:00:41.910> cells<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.420> talk<00:00:42.660> about<00:00:42.809> mitosis

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
multiple cells and we talk about mitosis

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.450 
multiple cells and we talk about mitosis
so<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.200> beginning<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.800> sperm<00:00:47.219> are

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so in the very beginning the sperm are

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
so in the very beginning the sperm are
swimming<00:00:48.210> towards<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> excel<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.129> through

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
swimming towards the excel up through

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.650 
swimming towards the excel up through
the<00:00:50.489> oviduct<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.210> usually<00:00:51.539> where

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the oviduct that's usually where

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.500 
the oviduct that's usually where
fertilization<00:00:52.250> happens<00:00:53.250> they're<00:00:54.030> following

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
fertilization happens they're following

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
fertilization happens they're following
a<00:00:54.719> chemical<00:00:55.140> gradient<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:55.890> produced<00:00:56.399> by

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
a chemical gradient that's produced by

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
a chemical gradient that's produced by
various<00:00:57.239> cells<00:00:57.539> including<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> follicle

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
various cells including the follicle

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.389 
various cells including the follicle
cells<00:00:58.620> surrounding<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> actual<00:01:00.420> open<00:01:01.399> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
cells surrounding the actual open the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
cells surrounding the actual open the
first<00:01:02.670> sperm<00:01:03.180> cell<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.510> we're<00:01:03.629> talking<00:01:03.870> about

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
first sperm cell so we're talking about

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
first sperm cell so we're talking about
500<00:01:04.710> million<00:01:04.860> trying<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
500 million trying to make it by the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.039 
500 million trying to make it by the
time<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.090> reached<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.869> maybe

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
time they actually reached there maybe

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.039 
time they actually reached there maybe
we're<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.680> 20%<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:09.150> less<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.960> have

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
we're down to 20% or less that have

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
we're down to 20% or less that have
actually<00:01:10.439> reached<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.130> ovum<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.270> trying

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
actually reached the ovum and are trying

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
actually reached the ovum and are trying
to<00:01:12.570> break<00:01:12.840> through<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> layer<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.799> chaperone

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to break through the layer of chaperone

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.690 
to break through the layer of chaperone
cells<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.150> follicle<00:01:15.659> cells<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.430> only<00:01:17.430> one

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cells these follicle cells here only one

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
cells these follicle cells here only one
of<00:01:17.970> these<00:01:18.710> hundreds<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.860> millions<00:01:20.189> will

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of these hundreds of millions will

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.570 
of these hundreds of millions will
actually<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
actually make it that's one of the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.130 
actually make it that's one of the
toughest<00:01:23.580> races<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> world<00:01:24.390> more

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
toughest races in the world more

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980 
toughest races in the world more
impressive<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> Amazing<00:01:26.759> Race<00:01:26.990> itself

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
impressive than the Amazing Race itself

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
impressive than the Amazing Race itself
it<00:01:28.229> binds<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> an<00:01:29.250> outer<00:01:29.400> layer<00:01:29.640> called<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it binds to an outer layer called the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.010 
it binds to an outer layer called the
zona<00:01:30.360> pellucida<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:33.000> almost<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
zona pellucida and it's almost like a a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
zona pellucida and it's almost like a a
greeting<00:01:34.439> type<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> thing<00:01:34.920> there's<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.460> little

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
greeting type of thing there's a little

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
greeting type of thing there's a little
cap<00:01:35.939> called<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> acrosome

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
cap called the acrosome

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.740 
cap called the acrosome
okay<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.549> acrosome<00:01:38.909> contains<00:01:39.540> enzymes

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
okay and the acrosome contains enzymes

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
okay and the acrosome contains enzymes
inside<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.710> happens<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> acrosome

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
inside so what happens is the acrosome

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
inside so what happens is the acrosome
opens<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> those<00:01:43.560> enzymes

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
opens up and some of those enzymes

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.069 
opens up and some of those enzymes
called<00:01:44.430> proteases<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.049> over

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
called proteases will actually go over

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.010 
called proteases will actually go over
and<00:01:46.680> digest<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.490> outer<00:01:47.729> layer<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.930> when

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and digest the outer layer here and when

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
and digest the outer layer here and when
the<00:01:49.110> protease<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.680> digest<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> outer<00:01:50.399> layer

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the protease is digest the outer layer

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.870 
the protease is digest the outer layer
that<00:01:51.270> allows<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.899> actual<00:01:52.500> cell<00:01:52.799> itself<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that allows the actual cell itself to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.630 
that allows the actual cell itself to
get<00:01:54.030> in

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.130 

the<00:01:59.640> proteases<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.300> help<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.630> digest<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the proteases will help to digest the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.960 
the proteases will help to digest the
route<00:02:01.350> through<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.860> zona<00:02:02.100> pellucida<00:02:02.220> in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
route through the zona pellucida in

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.140 
route through the zona pellucida in
order<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> reach<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.350> plasma<00:02:04.740> membrane<00:02:05.250> once

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
order to reach the plasma membrane once

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.580 
order to reach the plasma membrane once
that<00:02:06.420> reaches<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.750> plasma<00:02:07.080> membrane<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.470> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that reaches the plasma membrane and the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.080 
that reaches the plasma membrane and the
membranes<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.070> sperm<00:02:08.430> and<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> egg<00:02:08.850> will

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
membranes of the sperm and the egg will

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
membranes of the sperm and the egg will
actually<00:02:09.510> fuse<00:02:09.750> together<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.590> sperm

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
actually fuse together and the sperm

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.760 
actually fuse together and the sperm
nucleus<00:02:10.950> will<00:02:11.520> enter<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.970> egg<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.500> once<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
nucleus will enter the egg and once that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.360 
nucleus will enter the egg and once that
happens<00:02:14.220> then<00:02:14.670> all<00:02:15.800> doors<00:02:16.800> get<00:02:17.100> shut<00:02:17.340> down

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
happens then all doors get shut down

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520 
happens then all doors get shut down
that's<00:02:17.730> called<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> cortical<00:02:18.510> reaction<00:02:18.690> so

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that's called the cortical reaction so

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.940 
that's called the cortical reaction so
the<00:02:19.620> cortical<00:02:19.980> reaction<00:02:20.450> basically<00:02:21.950> without

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the cortical reaction basically without

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.290 
the cortical reaction basically without
getting<00:02:23.400> too<00:02:23.520> confused<00:02:23.910> about<00:02:24.000> all<00:02:24.180> these

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
getting too confused about all these

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.000 
getting too confused about all these
extra<00:02:24.600> things<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.350> whole<00:02:25.560> point<00:02:25.830> is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
extra things here the whole point is

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040 
extra things here the whole point is
that<00:02:26.040> once<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.670> sperm<00:02:27.000> cell<00:02:27.270> enters<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
that once one sperm cell enters you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.780 
that once one sperm cell enters you
can't<00:02:28.320> have<00:02:28.530> any<00:02:28.680> others<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.250> are<00:02:29.340> entering

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
can't have any others that are entering

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.390 
can't have any others that are entering
right<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.630> once<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.110> one<00:02:31.350> enters<00:02:31.770> then<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
right so once that one enters then the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.980 
right so once that one enters then the
nuclear<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.940> nuclei<00:02:33.270> fuse

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
nuclear the nuclei fuse

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.020 
nuclear the nuclei fuse
well<00:02:34.350> something<00:02:34.920> happens<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.430> order<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.670> shut

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
well something happens in order to shut

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.420 
well something happens in order to shut
down<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.480> outer<00:02:36.660> wall<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.140> prevent<00:02:37.380> any<00:02:38.100> other

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
down the outer wall to prevent any other

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.520 
down the outer wall to prevent any other
sperm<00:02:38.790> cells<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.360> their<00:02:39.570> protease<00:02:39.990> enzymes

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
sperm cells and their protease enzymes

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.920 
sperm cells and their protease enzymes
from<00:02:41.040> digesting<00:02:41.640> additional<00:02:42.420> holes<00:02:42.630> through

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
from digesting additional holes through

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.810 
from digesting additional holes through
because<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.260> don't<00:02:43.440> want<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.800> DNA<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.790> are

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
because we don't want more DNA that are

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.090 
because we don't want more DNA that are
going<00:02:45.030> through<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.530> when<00:02:47.010> this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
going through there so when this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.190 
going through there so when this
actually<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.790> cortical<00:02:48.390> reaction

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
actually what is the cortical reaction

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.850 
actually what is the cortical reaction
there<00:02:49.620> are<00:02:49.709> small<00:02:49.920> vesicles<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:51.020> they<00:02:52.020> move

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
there are small vesicles and they move

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.220 
there are small vesicles and they move
to<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.459> eggs<00:02:53.820> membrane<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.540> they<00:02:54.630> fuse<00:02:54.990> by

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to the eggs membrane and they fuse by

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.290 
to the eggs membrane and they fuse by
exocytosis<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:56.520> release<00:02:56.880> their

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
exocytosis and they release their

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.820 
exocytosis and they release their
contents<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> enzymes<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.709> they

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
contents and the enzymes that they

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.820 
contents and the enzymes that they
contain<00:02:59.220> cause<00:03:00.350> glycoproteins<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.620> make

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
contain cause glycoproteins to make

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.220 
contain cause glycoproteins to make
links<00:03:02.550> with<00:03:02.760> each<00:03:02.910> other<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.959> almost

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
links with each other so it's almost

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.220 
links with each other so it's almost
like<00:03:04.560> you're<00:03:05.370> building<00:03:05.880> extra<00:03:06.570> scaffolding

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
like you're building extra scaffolding

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.290 
like you're building extra scaffolding
to<00:03:07.440> prevent<00:03:07.890> anything<00:03:08.280> else<00:03:08.459> from<00:03:08.910> actually

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
to prevent anything else from actually

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.210 
to prevent anything else from actually
coming<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.750> CP<00:03:10.170> stands<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.680> short<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
coming in CP stands is short for the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.330 
coming in CP stands is short for the
zona<00:03:11.430> pellucida<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.140> becomes<00:03:13.530> hard<00:03:14.070> and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
zona pellucida so it becomes hard and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.640 
zona pellucida so it becomes hard and
stiff<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.030> nothing<00:03:15.630> else<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:16.019> actually<00:03:16.410> come

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
stiff and nothing else can actually come

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.650 
stiff and nothing else can actually come
in<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.370> therefore<00:03:17.550> blocks<00:03:17.970> further<00:03:18.209> entry

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
in and so therefore blocks further entry

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.570 
in and so therefore blocks further entry
that<00:03:19.019> are<00:03:19.140> by<00:03:19.260> sealing<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> deal<00:03:20.100> between

whole<00:03:27.870> process<00:03:28.080> here<00:03:28.470> once<00:03:29.190> we<00:03:29.430> get<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.790> one

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
whole process here once we get that one

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.210 
whole process here once we get that one
zygote<00:03:30.630> formed<00:03:30.989> as<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> result<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.830> fusing

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
zygote formed as a result of the fusing

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.790 
zygote formed as a result of the fusing
between<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.970> one<00:03:33.209> sperm<00:03:33.510> cell<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.530> one

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800

between the one sperm cell and the one
egg<00:03:35.070> cell<00:03:35.430> then<00:03:35.940> these<00:03:36.300> cells<00:03:36.630> start<00:03:36.780> to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
egg cell then these cells start to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.940 
egg cell then these cells start to
duplicate<00:03:38.130> by<00:03:39.110> mitosis<00:03:40.110> normally<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.830> then

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
duplicate by mitosis normally and then

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.970 
duplicate by mitosis normally and then
you<00:03:41.070> end<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.310> with<00:03:41.459> two<00:03:41.610> cells<00:03:41.910> 4<00:03:42.330> 8<00:03:42.630> 16<00:03:43.140> 32<00:03:43.170> 64

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
you end up with two cells 4 8 16 32 64

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.280 
you end up with two cells 4 8 16 32 64
so<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.700> forth<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.450> at<00:03:45.570> that<00:03:45.720> stage<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.110> call

so on so forth and at that stage we call

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.460 
so on so forth and at that stage we call
it<00:03:46.470> an<00:03:46.590> embryo<00:03:47.280> okay<00:03:48.209> that's<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.080> basic
