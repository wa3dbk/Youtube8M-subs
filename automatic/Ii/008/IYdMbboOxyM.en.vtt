00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.980
 welcome 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.990
 mid at the request of many subscribers in this 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.389
 video will tell you about addons that I 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.550
 I think I use addons in general 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.010
 very good thing if you are weak 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.930
 while she doesn’t load the system much but not 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.750
 which greatly facilitate gaming 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.210
 process so first thing expert 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.699
 probably my most addon 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.279
 replaces the standard character interface 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.910
 raid buffs and debuffs flexible in 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.260
 settings 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.850
 really the first time you have to 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.570
 rummage to come to the right 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 the result 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.530
 interface row x 1 as for me not 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.080
 so very much instead of me 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.089
 standard for setting you on mini 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.830
 A white button appears on the map. 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.229
 clicking on it you can move 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.180
 character modules customize their size 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.280
 add or remove necessary components 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.890
 I for example left only frames 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.150
 character and goals possible for these purposes 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.400
 there are other addons 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.239
 but my choice was an expert 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.489
 mobster 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.830
 I use this house exclusively for 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.839
 displaying coordinates on the map is convenient to look for. 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.270
 or that the other objects 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.200
 the possibilities of this addon if i have them 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.630
 not using 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.969
 master plan is a convenient addon for 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.189
 interface colleagues probably the main thing 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.020
 his advantage is that he delivers 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.299
 us from watching your battles 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.579
 companions and subsequent discovery 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.950
 chests all missions he completes 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.899
 instantly shows how much is left 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.880
 time before the task disappears 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.740
 if you don’t execute it 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.659
 most profitable teams of supporters for 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.060
 tasks with the maximum success rate 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.159
 as well as minor type functions 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.710
 showing experience of colleagues and show 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.729
 abilities of all your fellow generals 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.109
 excellent addon who did not put advise 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.509
 auction tor in my opinion is the best 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.729
 addon for an option adds to 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.460
 standard auction tab buy 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.749
 sell and still not need it 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.520
 will click on each time 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.069
 proof of purchase 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.140
 just choose a product to bathe each 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.920
 one click lot also you can 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.499
 track down 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.659
 the relevance of their lots in the tab yet 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.789
 click on the check price button 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.420
 all your lots that will be killed 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.550
 marked 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.340
 and then you can remove them from the auction 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.680
 and put on a new bogdan addon for 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.200
 bags combines all bags into one 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 tune up to any 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.239
 size the number of columns of rows and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.599
 Otherwise I recommend instant scrolling battle 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.150
 text or abbreviated mbt adds 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.950
 text of the battle your interface addon does you 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.510
 will not help unless you check 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 any to d3 not 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.800
 and stuff i would say addon for 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.950
 visual observation you are casting your 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.750
 Rows also has flexible settings 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.580
 it is possible to change the font of the text area 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.680
 on which goes the text and stuff 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.200
 next addon probably like any 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.720
 Vader dbm has a lot of settings 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.030
 you can remove or add specific 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.090
 announcements for your class or specs 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.340
 greatly simplifies the rating process well 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.519
 your dignity meter or 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.709
 in common pussy measures scada in general 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.709
 these are the main addons that I use 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.440
 there are still smaller type x slot replaces 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.319
 standard postal loot window adds to 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.630
 mailbox pick all button 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.209
 auto-profit x2 selling gray stuff on 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.700
 I think this all links to download on 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.420
 all addons I added description thanks for 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.430
 Attention 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.430
 but on this I have everything and everything everything
