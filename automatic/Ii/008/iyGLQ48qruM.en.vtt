00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 American football category sub-15 him 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.309
 we won Colombia by a yardstick and we are 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.309
 the South American monarchs 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.390
 and red and white for melons looking for 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.840
 incredible publi is true in a 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.509
 smaller category but like this we sow for 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.939
 the future we will have the images of 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.880
 peru champion but it is a campaign 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.779
 great in this way the team but 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.989
 not in six games he won five and tied 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.510
 only one I beat Colombia 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.399
 thanks to the annotation of luis and me 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.030
 disco the end of the meeting in 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:47.070
 our Iberian 82 was also crowned as 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.370
 the scorer of the tournament with 7 goals 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.339
 jj pray was that he led the Peruvian team 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.670
 and this technician has already been the last 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.649
 had brought us to a world cup hopefully 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.989
 these victories are not one like that but that 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.839
 be a bad antoine ways and to 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.030
 frequent are three payrolls are also 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.470
 jotitas is the campaign of Peru was 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 impressive here we see the triumph 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.980
 against which only vote for 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.110
 argentina 44 we give here 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.060
 we beat Bolivia we beat him 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.370
 Paraguay and in the final we beat 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.980
 Colombia of a tightly closed party 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.110
 Colombian dominated by long stretches of 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.560
 encounter but about the end it appears 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.540
 Luis Iberian and bathes us with glory 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.020
 this is a job that is just beginning 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.079
 but points to the South American sub-17 to 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.689
 early 2015 that classifies the 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.970
 world and there we have to do so 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.110
 less the same as the jotitas did 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.420
 previous of Juan Jose I prayed but so 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.929
 so much so this team already qualified 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.720
 to the Olympic Youth Games in 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.579
 China 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.950

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.170

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.659
 which Peru is South American champion 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.289
 sub-15 all teams participated 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.660
 uruguay chile brasil argentina and 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.480
 colombia and us without lords we 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.300
 the Peruvians at the end we take the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.920
 we brought the title which are are 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.650
 guys who are still in training 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.360
 let's say they come a lot to give us and 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.480
 I just saw on twitter 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.400
 several people asked asking me to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.650
 we had patience on all the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 press that we will treat it with a lot of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.220
 because they are additions of duty is not a 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.799
 but you also have to celebrate it is 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.380
 because when when but is champion in 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.239
 a South American and even more in football if 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.830
 it's good news does not put us 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.120
 I'm glad that this is the way 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.620
 you have to continue you have to bet on the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.209
 lower divisions by additions 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.370
 minors so that later we can 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.650
 harvest because it is the future you 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.410

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.080

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.940
 through between this victory and in the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.840
 next good South American have 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.239
 enough time to prepare 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.220
 these guys and of course to give 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.769
 everything I decided to continue giving us many 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.810
 joys of truth of good thing good 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.550
