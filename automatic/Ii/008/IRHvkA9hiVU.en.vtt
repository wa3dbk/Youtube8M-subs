00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello well you're on the stand 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.130
 the waves and flo that builds the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.130
 twinbee a very simple little device 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 the vocation of the twinbee I believe on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.090
 hope in any case it will be for the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.890
 schools it's a very easy machine to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.670
 pilot 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.040
 it is equipped with savannah wings 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.090
 so we did not invent anything there these are 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.090
 proven wings 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.809
 it is presented in two models on 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.610
 first model with the engine verner who 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.000
 is a Czech engine of other versions 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 with 912 rotax motor which was 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.620
 interesting on this machine it's 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 that we can fold the wings so in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.840
 positioning an axis there in the middle a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 another way there by detaching the stays 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.430
 they have several positions 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 we raise them up the landes 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 first aims at the two fasteners and we 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.380
 rotates it takes way to the m 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 parallel to the tail tubes and to this 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 moment there you have a machine that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.430
 takes up much less space in the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.380
 hangar 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.710
 that's the essential advantage 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 today what you're filming here is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.299
 one of the two prototypes we have 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.570
 realized this one is equipped with the engine 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.130
 rotax you have a dash everything 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.340
 in fact traditional with small 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.759
 seats of home design seats 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.490
 this device benefits from 6 years of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.670
 looking for intense work and at 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.130
 departure he presented himself as these 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.130
 they were cut there 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.590
 and we had turbulence problems 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.350
 and that's why we walked along this 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.030
 part so far so to eliminate these 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.070
 turbulence and now we have a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.409
 machine that flies safely 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.880
 it's really easy is the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.579
 machine that is still flying at 40 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.640
 kilometers hour that has a speed of 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.550
 cruise from 140 to 145 km time with a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.709
 top speed of 160 said this is it's 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.959
 an interesting little machine that gets 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.780
 positions I think in the market of 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.950
 quite correct way with respect to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.200
 price is 38 thousand euros + taxes 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.900
 for the version with the engine verner and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.080
 we go to 43 thousand euros + taxes for 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.640
 the version with 912 engine so I 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.170
 wanted to introduce you too because 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.829
 was there the werner motor 84 horses 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.190
 it is the 133 m engine cap of 84 horses 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:45.450
 air-cooled and his little brother here 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.549
 the 360 J CV which is a small engine of 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.079
 35 horses 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.000
 these two engines are priced fairly 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:58.670
 interesting because it sells to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.670
 7600 20 euros before taxes and this one 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.280
 3120 euros + taxes
