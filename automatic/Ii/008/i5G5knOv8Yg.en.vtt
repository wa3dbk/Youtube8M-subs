00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.049
 come to more to Guadalajara and know their 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840
 new models visit more than placencia 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.119
 in front of kodak to more than aqueduct to a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.390
 side of iron door and more than 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.279
 galleries opposite to farm city 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 very good friend we are back here 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.840
 in the garage and now I want to talk to you 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.350
 of buick summer 2013 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.260
 look at this car is the most recent in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 the most recent attempt to live by 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 lower the average age of their 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.770
 buyers then it 's a compact car 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.100
 and with 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.710
 very good power good finished and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.520
 also a very good handling 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.210
 it's the same platform as the opel astra and 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.930
 of the chevrolet cruze front-wheel drive 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.290
 but here under the hood we have an engine 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.350
 4-cylinder turbo 2- liter with 250 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.259
 horses is a bullet in the car runs 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.020
 quite pretty well you feel it with 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.119
 power all the time and the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.100
 single point 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.509
 let's say weak of all that power is the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.950
 fact that the traction is in front 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.940
 certainly this also happens in the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.300
 mini when you accelerate from a 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.430
 abruptly the steering wheel feels the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.200
 Torque and lose a little bit 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.440
 control you have to hold it with a lot 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.820
 strength and a lot of care not to lose the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.210
 control the car while you accelerate it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.210
 inside 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.040
 the summer has good interior space 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.160
 good finished and very nice here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.630
 this plastic is not cushioned this without 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.600
 this one either but it looks good 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 It's a relatively clean design though 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.100
 this central shape 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.599
 has too many buttons buttons 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.340
 for all air control and so on 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.470
 has also there is a screen that already 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.110
 has system that view calls 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.690
 intellilink is the system of living 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.069
 equivalent to the bad link of chevrolet and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.340
 to the cadillac club 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.670
 a box of automatic six speeds 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.900
 with manual mode and very equipment details 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.900
 interesting like him 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.099
 what is this thing called the brake of 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.260
 parking this electronic camera 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.260
 reverse sunroof 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.569
 leather steering wheel courtesy lights 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.450
 leather seats in general of a car 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.389
 nice well equipped powerful a good 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.519
 sound signed by voice and details 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.540
 interesting what the game did not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.599
 it is very clear is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.219
 outside and outside is a car 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.099
 that seems nice to me is nice to the 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:08.609
 seen but not necessarily juvenile or 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.459
 be I do not know if a young man first does not 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.069
 there are many young people who have 440 thousand 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.010
 pesos to pay what is worth a summer 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.370
 439 thousand 900 to be more exact second 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.060
 if you have them I do not know if that person is going 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.450
 to prefer the power and equipment that 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.019
 has the vic or the prestige of let's say 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.340
 a mercedes benz class c although in his 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.549
 basic version that costs practically 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.370
 the same as this one has almost nothing of 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.049
 team follows if in a mercedes benz no 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.450
 it has less power whatever you want and 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.819
 you like but it's a mercedes benz and that's 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.819
 a name that has a lot of strength in the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.860
 market the rear space is quite 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.310
 reduced as you can see 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.970
 complicated to walk here the long time the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.280
 Headroom hardly exists just 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:05.880
 it's enough if under that console 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.670
 I have but I still armrest 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.600
 squeeze a little bit more travel in between 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.600
 It's going to be equally complicated because 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.400
 there is some hindrance reading in the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.530
 transmission that is not so high but of 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.500
 it hurts but the basis of the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.930
 Accent completely removes you from the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.780
 space the head I'm hitting with 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.870
 this interior light here for the little 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.110
 space that we have back then it is a 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.450
 more oriented car for those who are going 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.410
 forward in the US market 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.410
 This is good 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.199
 the rear seat space is not so 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.749
 important in the US was once 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.759
 now no longer because most of the 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:54.159
 people have their own car and what 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.259
 drive when you bring your partner 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.949
 hardly another couple children and when 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.979
 bring them a sv then it is not so 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.289
 important and that's why chevrolet has done 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.930
 vehicles like this one and like the cadillac 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.419
 ats that we also showed here we saw 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.909
 that the rear space is equal 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.270
 reduced or worse or even more reduced than 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:19.090
 in this summer 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.340
 now unlike the cadillac ats this 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.800
 at least it has a pretty drawer 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.440
 good the entrance mouth that girl is 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.110
 small this could come a little bit more 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:33.250
 downstairs maybe complicate the design 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:36.520
 I'm not a car designer but if the 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.290
 small mouth but the floor is flat if the 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.530
 side are practically flat 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.870
 flat and there's very good depth I 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.780
 I think that with a better design it would have 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.370
 could also improve the space 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.650
 back that for me is one of the 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.280
 big problems of this car 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.130
 but if we go to a problem of 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.860
 summer for me this has to do with 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.889
 a question of identity and us 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.749
 sell lives as a luxury brand 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.300
 and there it is good what is finally 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:09.989
 the luxury brand cadillac government the 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.899
 2pm s also 

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:16.299
 will really be people will perceive live 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:18.729
 with the luxury brand I do not think I think 

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:20.709
 that living is the equivalent of what 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.289
 some day it was mercury in fort that no longer 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:27.549
 there is merkel then if it is a brand 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:29.769
 which is above chevrolet but not 

00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:32.019
 as much as cadhla that in that they are of 

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:34.419
 agreement people agree to the 

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:36.519
 general motors people what are not 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.939
 of agreement is that they believe that this 

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:43.419
 Car competes against Germans as BMW 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:45.849
 mercedes benz audi etcetera and I do not think 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.139
 so be it I think that for that it does 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.870
 lack 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.509
 and many more things he would need to 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.629
 start rear-wheel drive and you 'll tell me the 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.699
 you have it if you have it but you are not 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:59.979
 you need other things you need a 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:03.580
 more interesting design I like more 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:06.759
 for example balance and cleanliness 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.729
 of lines this summer that of 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:14.770
 cadillac ats but it's a nice car 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:18.970
 it's a good car but 440 thousand pesos 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.310
 I would think it would not 2 not 350 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.490
 times before buying a car for this 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.190
 price with this size despite having 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.409
 that power I repeat or insist 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.629
 Fatigue is not a bad car on the contrary 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.870
 it's a very good car but I think 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:38.080
 It should cost at least 60 70 thousand 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.940
 weights less than what it is worth for me 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.180
 I would consider it really competitive 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.770
 thank you very much for the attention and we 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.069
 we see here with more in the next 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.069
 week
