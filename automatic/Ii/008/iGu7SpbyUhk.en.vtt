what I'm doing all my drum camps here at
the<00:00:57.350> mics<00:00:57.500> lessons<00:00:57.829> comm<00:00:58.130> facility<00:00:58.700> but<00:00:59.210> I

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
the mics lessons comm facility but I

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.910 
the mics lessons comm facility but I
figured<00:00:59.630> I've<00:00:59.870> got<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:00.110> got<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> drum<00:01:00.590> camp<00:01:00.770> that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
figured I've got I got a drum camp that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.410 
figured I've got I got a drum camp that
starts<00:01:01.160> in<00:01:01.250> about<00:01:01.310> two<00:01:01.550> hours<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.060> I<00:01:02.149> figured

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
starts in about two hours and I figured

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.329 
starts in about two hours and I figured
I'd<00:01:02.510> give<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:02.690> guys<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.870> lesson<00:01:03.380> because<00:01:03.500> you

to<00:01:07.580> freak<00:01:07.820> when<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.060> figure<00:01:08.330> out<00:01:08.360> how<00:01:08.540> easy

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
to freak when you figure out how easy

to freak when you figure out how easy
this<00:01:09.200> lick<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:11.030> simple

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
this lick is and it's just a simple

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.120 
this lick is and it's just a simple
permutation<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.200> right<00:01:12.410> left<00:01:12.649> kick<00:01:12.860> or<00:01:13.009> any

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
permutation of right left kick or any

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.710 
permutation of right left kick or any
group<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.520> three<00:01:13.759> that's<00:01:13.970> two<00:01:14.180> hands<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.690> a

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
group of three that's two hands and a

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.990 
group of three that's two hands and a
foot<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.170> as<00:01:15.649> far<00:01:15.830> as<00:01:15.890> what<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.130> permutation<00:01:16.550> is

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
foot and as far as what a permutation is

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.190 
foot and as far as what a permutation is
if<00:01:17.180> you've<00:01:17.300> heard<00:01:17.479> that<00:01:17.630> word<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.050> never

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
if you've heard that word but you never

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.450 
if you've heard that word but you never
really<00:01:18.380> knew<00:01:18.619> what<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.860> means<00:01:19.100> it's<00:01:19.220> just

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
really knew what it means it's just

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.520 
really knew what it means it's just
rearranging<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.540> permutation<00:01:21.170> or<00:01:21.350> two

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
rearranging so permutation or two

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.990 
rearranging so permutation or two
permutate<00:01:22.040> something<00:01:22.340> literally<00:01:22.610> means<00:01:22.820> to

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
permutate something literally means to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.490 
permutate something literally means to
rearrange<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:23.900> we're<00:01:24.200> going<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.350> take

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
rearrange it so we're going to take

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.380 
rearrange it so we're going to take
something<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:24.979> right<00:01:25.280> left<00:01:25.549> kick<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.060> just

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
something like right left kick and just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.110 
something like right left kick and just
rearrange<00:01:26.690> it<00:01:27.080> now<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.130> entire<00:01:28.310> lick<00:01:28.880> is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
rearrange it now this entire lick is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.300 
rearrange it now this entire lick is
built<00:01:29.780> out<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.310> right<00:01:31.310> kick<00:01:31.970> right<00:01:32.770> left<00:01:33.770> kick

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
built out of right kick right left kick

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.149 
built out of right kick right left kick
left<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.260> I<00:01:36.470> wish<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.920> was<00:01:37.010> more

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
left that is it I wish it was more

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:51.240 
left that is it I wish it was more
difficult<00:01:37.340> than<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.000> literally<00:01:38.390> is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.850 

so<00:01:52.250> your<00:01:52.670> job<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.570> not<00:01:53.870> try<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.440> do<00:01:54.620> it<00:01:54.650> at

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
so your job is to not try to do it at

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.440 
so your job is to not try to do it at
eight<00:01:55.040> billion<00:01:55.490> miles<00:01:55.820> an<00:01:56.000> hour<00:01:56.120> and<00:01:56.270> be<00:01:56.330> like

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
eight billion miles an hour and be like

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.990 
eight billion miles an hour and be like
oh<00:01:56.570> okay<00:01:56.600> right<00:01:57.350> give<00:01:57.620> me<00:01:57.730> because<00:01:58.730> then<00:01:58.850> it'll

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
oh okay right give me because then it'll

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.700 
oh okay right give me because then it'll
just<00:01:59.030> be<00:01:59.270> sloppy<00:01:59.570> jalopy<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.320> need<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.530> play

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
just be sloppy jalopy you need to play

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.710 
just be sloppy jalopy you need to play
it<00:02:00.860> one<00:02:01.040> note<00:02:01.250> at<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.430> time<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.850> while<00:02:02.240> doing<00:02:02.450> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
it one note at a time and while doing it

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.660 
it one note at a time and while doing it
slow<00:02:03.020> even<00:02:03.410> if<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.620> think<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.920> can<00:02:04.010> go<00:02:04.100> faster

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
slow even if you think you can go faster

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.330 
slow even if you think you can go faster
don't<00:02:05.000> play<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.780> extremely<00:02:06.320> slow<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.860> allow

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
don't play it extremely slow and allow

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.430 
don't play it extremely slow and allow
your<00:02:07.640> brain<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.050> memorize<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.229> motor

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
your brain to memorize the motor

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.020 
your brain to memorize the motor
function<00:02:09.920> that's<00:02:10.220> what<00:02:10.430> we<00:02:10.520> call<00:02:10.700> muscle

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
function that's what we call muscle

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.000 
function that's what we call muscle
memory<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.480> allow<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.290> happen<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:12.800> you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
memory and allow that to happen so you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.310 
memory and allow that to happen so you
can<00:02:13.250> play<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.520> faster<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:13.970> cleaner<00:02:14.210> let's<00:02:15.200> do

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
can play it faster and cleaner let's do

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:28.090 
can play it faster and cleaner let's do
it<00:02:15.410> together<00:02:15.530> nice<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.370> slow<00:02:26.920> now<00:02:27.920> if<00:02:28.010> you

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
it together nice and slow now if you

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.320 
it together nice and slow now if you
need<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> different<00:02:28.460> way<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.760> think<00:02:29.030> about<00:02:29.240> this

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
need a different way to think about this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.490 
need a different way to think about this
just<00:02:29.600> think<00:02:29.780> about<00:02:29.930> playing<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.260> simple

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
just think about playing a simple

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.350 
just think about playing a simple
shuffle<00:02:31.010> pattern<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.610> football<00:02:31.880> rolling

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
shuffle pattern just a football rolling

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
shuffle pattern just a football rolling
down<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> hill<00:02:32.660> two<00:02:33.530> notes<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:34.010> your<00:02:34.130> right

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
down a hill two notes with your right

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.440 
down a hill two notes with your right
