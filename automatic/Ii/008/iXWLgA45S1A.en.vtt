00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.700
 Loeb his first eleven in by-elections 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.450
 Legendary is good and the content changes 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.149
 he promoted a Dr 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.970
 all other brands 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.239
 after that was unavailable for comment 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.869
 on Wall Street 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.649
 there is a level and I write lyrics want the tips 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.180
 maybe even after the steps 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.310
 I'm only stopping as a kicker but also Bamberg and longer 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.730
 which here are just a few measures for the World Cup 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.720
 with whom also can well imagine 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.630
 appropriate one hard 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.660
 this last time and then if one believes you just 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.680
 not only consistent first glance more states tops off 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 undeclared house 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.400
 why have Hans Meyer? 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.410
 in three parts 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.490
 because in Manchester so far, all in all remains 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.970
 also professional 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.720
 but hear Prague 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 sometimes tell 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.770
 he should only be explicit from the first robbery that the left guardrail 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.770
 developed countries 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160
 Now I can say that the others can be too 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
 the Munster 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.930
 read 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.620
 Vest 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.620
 so far, however, is not yet in sight 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.609
 we do not see here 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:17.170
 Carl Zeiss is unclear and they are coming down here now 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.339
 and just possible to kill 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.929
 laughs no 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.810
 4 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.700
 at 11 4 million the knockout round for great grief 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 Dominique Baettig can arrange 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.609
 9 good news Lust 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.779
 every single cent so exhibition manager hours again first 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.980
 Not even warming up what the other channels are 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.029
 may be more often 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.489
 against the Roosters reckon again 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.489
 some 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.829
 I want to be clear 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.859
 that's always the rest 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.339
 sometimes we feel like Friday 4 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.669
 Here is what to do 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.669
 Harrison at its fullest 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.259
 Schwerin 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.159
 and very simple 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.179
 still gets 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.179
 she is already there 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.049
 he is about 30 years old children the individual stages 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.279
 and I still think so 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.050
 Dr was soon 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.540
 because you already go beyond other formats and now 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.009
 it could come 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.869
 if it's just a small problem with preparatory work so far 

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:27.729
 want 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.069
 less than one percent dropped Mas 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.069
 we just have to have some 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.159
 there are no two of us here either 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.749
 again was from the HR 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.789
 and 4 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.849
 still did 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.479
 Turin 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.189
 and so a rival came under it 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.510
 the hair cells cut to 11
