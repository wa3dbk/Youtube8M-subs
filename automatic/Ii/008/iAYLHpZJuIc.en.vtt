00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.100
 So much has been said about the famous 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.969
 Water 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.610
 the only certain thing is that apple already registered 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.980
 the name of water and already patented 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 toll and a few days ago this 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.120
 video that if this is going to be the water 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.220
 I want to see it because that is to say see 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.470
 like how you navigate almost as 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.970
 as a larger iPhone screen 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.090
 in those who have presented more manga 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.040
 that's right and the design is very similar 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.040
 what more support 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.900
 7 more or less and then this video is 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.680
 video is the one that has circulated the most today in 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.810
 day and apparently this base of things 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.610
 basic did not really give me what is so 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.070
 functional as arturo says it can be 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.600
 this watch looks at the tendency to 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.670
 less in the shows are 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.899
 showing the eggs that are the eggs 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.329
 through the streets that do not wear 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.090
 eggs the gadgets that one puts on and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.939
 we tried herbs and I google them 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 classes and ten minutes with them and the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.700
 right point and then talk over here 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.659
 the samsung galaxy is a failure of no 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.030
 It has been sold 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.369
 I feel that the phone is more accessible 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.939
 it is removed it is saved instead of having it 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.939
 active 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.860
 quickly because many things that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.960
 when I say candy micros is connected 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 notice that talking about patentar candy 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.750
 cross wants to patent the word candil 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.090
 was in these moments and notice that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 all that creators or 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.450
 app developers already got it and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.549
 if they get into the laptop and look for candy 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 appeared as 40 new games with the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.140
 word change to paste it candy 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.260
 crowley but this is only one 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.860
 application in applications 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.229
 then the creative company of candy 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.270
 cross because they want to register and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.440
 Now that they are they see more owners 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.440
 of the words meat
