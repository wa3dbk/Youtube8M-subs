00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
device has two features that blackberry

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.270 
device has two features that blackberry
have<00:03:24.299> added<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.870> first<00:03:26.109> one<00:03:26.319> is<00:03:26.349> that<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.769> get

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
have added the first one is that you get

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.789 
have added the first one is that you get
for<00:03:27.790> not<00:03:28.329> one<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.810> two<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.049> actually<00:03:29.500> four

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
for not one not two but actually four

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.920 
for not one not two but actually four
microphones<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.239> makes<00:03:31.419> for<00:03:31.599> a<00:03:31.629> much

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
microphones and that makes for a much

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.500 
microphones and that makes for a much
more<00:03:32.139> clearer<00:03:32.669> crisper<00:03:33.669> sound<00:03:33.970> when<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.359> make

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
more clearer crisper sound when you make

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.240 
more clearer crisper sound when you make
phone<00:03:34.720> calls<00:03:34.989> now<00:03:35.169> when<00:03:35.319> we<00:03:35.440> did<00:03:35.650> get<00:03:35.829> our<00:03:35.950> sim

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
phone calls now when we did get our sim

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.920 
phone calls now when we did get our sim
inside<00:03:36.579> there<00:03:36.849> made<00:03:37.359> couple<00:03:37.569> of<00:03:37.690> phone<00:03:37.900> calls

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
inside there made couple of phone calls

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.860 
inside there made couple of phone calls
it<00:03:38.829> was<00:03:39.040> really<00:03:39.400> really<00:03:39.549> clear<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.480> that's<00:03:40.660> one

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
it was really really clear so that's one

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.839 
it was really really clear so that's one
of<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.139> things<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.859> is<00:03:42.040> included<00:03:42.549> with<00:03:42.699> the

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
of the things that is included with the

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.849 
of the things that is included with the
said<00:03:43.180> 30<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.629> other<00:03:43.780> thing<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.199> the<00:03:44.650> ability

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
said 30 the other thing is the ability

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.780 
said 30 the other thing is the ability
for<00:03:45.840> better<00:03:46.840> antenna<00:03:47.430> 4G<00:03:48.430> network

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
for better antenna 4G network

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.129 
for better antenna 4G network
essentially<00:03:49.329> because<00:03:49.629> there<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> new

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
essentially because there is a new

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.300 
essentially because there is a new
antenna<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.910> z30<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.599> makes<00:03:53.310> this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
antenna in the z30 and it makes this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.970 
antenna in the z30 and it makes this
