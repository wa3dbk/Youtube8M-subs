00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
overly important throughout the battle
few<00:01:42.360> games<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> tent<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.290> hand<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
few games the tent you just hand of the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.490 
few games the tent you just hand of the
same<00:01:44.130> arsenal<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.810> expecting

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
same arsenal so I'm not really expecting

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
same arsenal so I'm not really expecting
enough<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.100> an<00:01:47.189> overhaul<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.030> guns

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
enough to be an overhaul with what guns

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
enough to be an overhaul with what guns
are<00:01:48.360> used<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.840> game<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.560> let's<00:01:50.189> continue

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
are used in this game so let's continue

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.190 
are used in this game so let's continue
looking<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.060> pictures<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> pictures

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
looking at more pictures on the pictures

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620 
looking at more pictures on the pictures
here<00:01:52.799> appears<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.369> some<00:01:53.670> tanks<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> stuff

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
here appears to be some tanks and stuff

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380 
here appears to be some tanks and stuff
I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.920> fuzzy<00:01:56.340> spout<00:01:57.060> field

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I think it's a bit fuzzy spout field

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.120 
I think it's a bit fuzzy spout field
what<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> expect<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.710> zoom<00:01:58.740> up

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
what do you expect but if we zoom up

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
what do you expect but if we zoom up
here<00:01:59.399> then<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> possible<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.750> kind

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
here then we can possible see this kind

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.959 
here then we can possible see this kind
of<00:02:01.049> looks<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> mountainous<00:02:02.250> region<00:02:02.729> type

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
deal and they were saying basically it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.160 
deal and they were saying basically it
looks<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.799> ski<00:02:05.159> lift<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.030> maybe<00:02:06.540> snowman

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
looks like a ski lift so maybe snowman
