00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 how to choose a name for your channel 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320
 Youtube 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.210
 this is the video tutorial that I bring 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.080
 on this occasion 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.460
 Well, I'll try to be the shortest and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.560
 explain as simple as possible 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.560
 Well, many have asked me this 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 this 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.610
 how to choose your name for the channel 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.640
 Youtube 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.100
 Well, first of all, there's something 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 think of a name 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.110
 the advice that I give you that is a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.510
 common name 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:48.580
 that is common is not to say a name 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.920
 invented since for the person it will be 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.490
 much harder to record the name of 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.790
 your channel 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.370
 for example when they already have their channel their 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.160
 audience to your audience who 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.879
 visit then you will see the name of your channel 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.190
 and if it is very easy for you they will remember it and 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.650
 later they will look for it with more facility 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.229
 so that way they will have much more visits 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.240
 and much more subscribers because if they see 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.580
 for example a video of yours from your channel 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.460
 but they have a very strange name in the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 channel 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.040
 for example I do not know there are those who put 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.720
 pure letters for example lx p &amp; z 25 38 yes 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.630
 they put that because it's going to be very difficult for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.939
 that the person remembers 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.900
 otherwise, if they put 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.890
 example 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.660
 I do not know for example 50 chicken because it's going to be 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.660
 much easier than you remember 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.280
 It is the first first recommendation 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:52.460
 Second, it would be 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.409
 that they write it a short man besides 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.030
 that he is a common man so be it 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.420
 short not so short because then also 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.970
 it could be very very very 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.610
 despicable we go very very 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.259
 insignificant but I do not know at least 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.259
 six or eight letters 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.530
 that is short so that also it is not 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.530
 so long since there are those who put the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.500
 name counted there are surnames and nickname and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.650
 how much, well, that's also very 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.410
 long and well it also refers difficult 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.830
 to remember for the user even if 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.830
 easy 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.760
 also one more thing at the time of 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.160
 choose the name because it recommends them not 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.790
 put double letter since that can then 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.430
 also even confuse the user by 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.650
 example if you put I do not know your name 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.650
 for example if they put jose alfredo 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.230
 and if they put jose 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.950
 and at the moment put alfredo they put double to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.610
 josé alfredo as the user when 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.640
 read it will read it quickly and maybe you 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.510
 be despicable 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.760
 and ignore and I fell double to so 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.890
 Once only José José is worth and at the moment 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.090
 to look for your channel because it's not going to 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.489
 appear for that reason it is better to always put 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.810
 only the letters that lead to double 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.220
 triple letter and so much less 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.810
 special characters the truth is 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.690
 I know how many think doing your 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.240
 mail because in fact you do not even 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.750
 It allows 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.810
 the truth I do not remember but why not put 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.840
 a question mark or a diagonal 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.910
 or a clear point because who try 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.200
 look for your channel because it will be very 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:54.560
 difficult to remember that special character 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.330
 good friends, that's all from a 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.010
 point of view then those are my 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.010
 personal recommendations 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.330
 and to choose the name because that would be 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.240
 to your taste corn and then I can not tell you 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.820
 Well, for example, your channel is going to be 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.700
 of gamers they can put something 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.350
 related to a game if it's going to be 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.820
 about technology as a name 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.400
 obviously with something related to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.740
 technology because then the name is your taste 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.110
 these recommendations I give them then 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.750
 so that the users are simply 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.660
 it is easy to find your channel and so that 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.889
 you also find it much greater 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.830
 practical and quickly be successful 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.580
 with your YouTube channel good if you 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.199
