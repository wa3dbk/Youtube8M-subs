you

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.950 

I<00:00:27.880> recommend<00:00:28.880> looking<00:00:28.970> at<00:00:29.179> picture<00:00:29.599> this<00:00:29.840> is

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
I recommend looking at picture this is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.839 
I recommend looking at picture this is
just<00:00:30.109> my<00:00:30.199> ipod<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:30.680> got<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:30.980> picture<00:00:31.730> off

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
just my ipod I got this picture off

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.310 
just my ipod I got this picture off
Google<00:00:32.149> it's<00:00:32.450> just<00:00:32.629> easier<00:00:32.930> to<00:00:32.989> have<00:00:33.110> a

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
Google it's just easier to have a

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.319 
Google it's just easier to have a
reference<00:00:33.890> because<00:00:34.489> as<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:34.670> can<00:00:34.820> see<00:00:34.970> from<00:00:35.149> me

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
reference because as you can see from me

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.330 
reference because as you can see from me
sculpting<00:00:35.780> this<00:00:35.960> in<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.620> top<00:00:36.829> of<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.070> broom

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
sculpting this in the top of this broom

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.799 
sculpting this in the top of this broom
is<00:00:37.430> kind<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.699> a<00:00:37.790> weird<00:00:37.970> shape<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.570> was<00:00:38.660> just

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
is kind of a weird shape and it was just

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.810 
is kind of a weird shape and it was just
so<00:00:38.899> much<00:00:38.989> easier<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.530> look<00:00:39.649> at<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:39.829> picture<00:00:40.040> so

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
so much easier to look at a picture so

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.369 
so much easier to look at a picture so
just<00:00:41.000> keep<00:00:41.149> scoping<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.660> may<00:00:41.840> take<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.140> while

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
just keep scoping it may take a while

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:43.840 
just keep scoping it may take a while
but<00:00:42.739> if<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.040> just<00:00:43.160> look<00:00:43.280> at<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.430> picture<00:00:43.610> it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
but if you just look at a picture it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.189 
but if you just look at a picture it
will<00:00:43.910> be<00:00:44.030> much<00:00:44.180> easier<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.540> see<00:00:44.809> then<00:00:45.019> looking

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
will be much easier to see then looking

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.910 
will be much easier to see then looking
at<00:00:45.589> what<00:00:45.650> I'm<00:00:45.920> doing<00:00:45.949> in<00:00:46.309> this<00:00:46.400> video

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
at what I'm doing in this video

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.259 
at what I'm doing in this video
now<00:00:48.920> Harry's<00:00:49.250> broom<00:00:49.430> has<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:49.610> slight<00:00:49.879> curve<00:00:50.150> in

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
now Harry's broom has a slight curve in

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.000 
now Harry's broom has a slight curve in
it<00:00:50.420> so<00:00:50.629> using<00:00:50.930> your<00:00:51.050> reference<00:00:51.470> just<00:00:51.680> sort<00:00:51.949> of

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
it so using your reference just sort of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.110 
it so using your reference just sort of
put<00:00:52.159> it<00:00:52.220> in<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.370> right<00:00:52.519> place<00:00:52.699> it's<00:00:52.909> a<00:00:52.970> very

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
put it in the right place it's a very

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.939 
put it in the right place it's a very
subtle<00:00:53.360> kind<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.839> curve<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:54.320> don't<00:00:54.800> actually

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
subtle kind of curve I don't actually

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.979 
subtle kind of curve I don't actually
know<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.339> has<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.489> proper<00:00:56.210> use<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.659> Quidditch

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
know if it has a proper use in Quidditch

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.350 
know if it has a proper use in Quidditch
but<00:00:57.290> it<00:00:57.379> does<00:00:57.500> have<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:57.680> curve<00:00:57.890> in<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.159> so<00:00:58.820> now

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
but it does have a curve in it so now

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.000 
but it does have a curve in it so now
you<00:00:59.420> just<00:00:59.689> want<00:01:00.049> to<00:01:00.140> make<00:01:00.260> sure<00:01:00.439> that<00:01:00.559> it's<00:01:00.710> cut

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
you just want to make sure that it's cut

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.500 
you just want to make sure that it's cut
to<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:01.400> length<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:02.000> kind<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.269> want<00:01:02.449> it

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
to the right length you kind of want it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.390 
to the right length you kind of want it
quite<00:01:02.689> long<00:01:02.900> as<00:01:03.080> it'll<00:01:03.229> make<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.680> next<00:01:04.100> part

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
quite long as it'll make the next part

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.910 
quite long as it'll make the next part
shaping<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.299> sort<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.720> broom<00:01:05.990> bit<00:01:06.409> much

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
shaping the sort of broom bit much

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.109 
shaping the sort of broom bit much
easier<00:01:07.280> if<00:01:07.369> you've<00:01:07.460> got<00:01:07.580> something<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.880> shape

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
easier if you've got something to shape

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.899 
easier if you've got something to shape
around<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.500> leave<00:01:09.830> it<00:01:09.860> quite<00:01:10.100> long

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.230 

now<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.150> add<00:01:14.299> your<00:01:14.420> eye<00:01:14.570> pin<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.000> far

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
now just add your eye pin so so far

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.490 
now just add your eye pin so so far
that's<00:01:17.479> what<00:01:17.659> your<00:01:17.780> broom<00:01:17.960> should<00:01:18.170> look<00:01:18.320> like

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that's what your broom should look like

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.440 
that's what your broom should look like
now<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.770> just<00:01:18.979> want<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.250> cook<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:20.420> your

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
now you just want to cook it in your

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.630 
now you just want to cook it in your
oven<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.110> but<00:01:21.650> only<00:01:21.830> for<00:01:22.009> about<00:01:22.130> 10<00:01:22.460> minutes

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
oven and but only for about 10 minutes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.130 
oven and but only for about 10 minutes
just<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.030> make<00:01:23.060> sure<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.570> hard<00:01:23.810> but

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
just to make sure that it's hard but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.999 
just to make sure that it's hard but
it's<00:01:24.560> not<00:01:24.650> fully<00:01:24.950> cooked<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:27.560> once<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.830> cook

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
it's not fully cooked so once you cook

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.350 
it's not fully cooked so once you cook
that<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:28.310> can<00:01:28.460> then<00:01:28.610> go<00:01:28.759> on<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.090> broom

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
that you can then go on to the broom

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.600 
that you can then go on to the broom
part<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.950> basically<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:31.310> roll

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
part of it and so basically just roll

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.010 
part of it and so basically just roll
out<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.790> ball<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.180> clay<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.630> then<00:01:32.750> sort<00:01:32.990> of

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
out a ball of clay and then sort of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.780 
out a ball of clay and then sort of
pinch<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.500> squeeze<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.920> ends<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.430> then<00:01:34.610> roll

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
pinch and squeeze the ends and then roll

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.780 
pinch and squeeze the ends and then roll
them<00:01:34.970> out<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:35.330> get<00:01:35.570> sort<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.250> oval<00:01:37.250> 3d

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
them out so you get sort of a oval 3d

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.249 
them out so you get sort of a oval 3d
shape<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.360> don't<00:01:38.570> know<00:01:38.630> what<00:01:38.750> you'd<00:01:38.869> call<00:01:39.110> this

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
shape I don't know what you'd call this

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.370 
shape I don't know what you'd call this
and<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:40.399> you<00:01:40.549> does<00:01:41.000> take<00:01:41.270> Wireless<00:01:41.810> any<00:01:42.049> ages

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
and but you does take Wireless any ages

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.520 
and but you does take Wireless any ages
to<00:01:42.590> shape<00:01:43.040> my<00:01:43.220> that's<00:01:43.430> what<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.700> looks<00:01:43.880> like

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
to shape my that's what it looks like

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.109 
to shape my that's what it looks like
now<00:01:45.530> make<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.920> hole<00:01:46.190> using<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.850> end<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.060> a

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
now make a hole using the end of a

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.169 
now make a hole using the end of a
paintbrush<00:01:47.420> or<00:01:47.750> another<00:01:48.020> tool<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.970> make<00:01:49.970> sure

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
paintbrush or another tool and make sure

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.779 
paintbrush or another tool and make sure
the<00:01:50.509> stick<00:01:51.289> part<00:01:51.649> of<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> broom<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.429> cooked

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
the stick part of the broom is cooked

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.520 
the stick part of the broom is cooked
and<00:01:53.000> just<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.509> place<00:01:53.750> in<00:01:54.050> because<00:01:54.259> it'll<00:01:54.409> make

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
and just the place in because it'll make

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.010 
and just the place in because it'll make
it<00:01:54.649> much<00:01:54.860> easier<00:01:54.920> when<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:55.490> cooked<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:56.630> may

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
it much easier when it's cooked it may

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.570 
it much easier when it's cooked it may
take<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.259> few<00:01:57.350> goes<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.009> don't<00:01:58.250> make<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.399> too

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
take a few goes but don't make it too

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.830 
take a few goes but don't make it too
big<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.759> hole<00:01:59.030> because<00:01:59.119> then<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.450> won't<00:01:59.539> fit

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
big a hole because then it won't fit

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.120 
big a hole because then it won't fit
right<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.289> you'll<00:02:00.440> have<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.710> mold<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:01.100> bit

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
right and you'll have to mold it a bit

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.820 
right and you'll have to mold it a bit
more<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.640> just<00:02:02.270> takes<00:02:02.479> way<00:02:02.630> too<00:02:02.659> long<00:02:02.830> so

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
more and that just takes way too long so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.990 
more and that just takes way too long so
just<00:02:03.860> keep<00:02:04.159> pressing<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.640> on<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.850> make<00:02:04.970> sure

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
just keep pressing it on to make sure

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.490 
just keep pressing it on to make sure
it's<00:02:05.270> firmly<00:02:05.600> on<00:02:05.869> there<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.170> don't<00:02:06.200> want<00:02:06.440> it

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
it's firmly on there you don't want it

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.960 
it's firmly on there you don't want it
falling<00:02:06.679> off<00:02:06.950> when<00:02:07.159> you're<00:02:07.280> sculpting<00:02:07.550> around

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
falling off when you're sculpting around

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.240 
falling off when you're sculpting around
it<00:02:11.170> next<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.260> want<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.410> add<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.739> top<00:02:12.920> bit<00:02:13.100> and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
it next you want to add the top bit and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.009 
it next you want to add the top bit and
this<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.459> one<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> files<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.269> corrupt<00:02:14.630> so

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
this is one of the files that corrupt so

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.180 
this is one of the files that corrupt so
I'll<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.380> show<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.500> how<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.709> do<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.010> just

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
I'll just show you how to do it just

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.979 
I'll just show you how to do it just
roll<00:02:16.640> out<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.790> sausage<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.450> flatten<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.870> out

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
roll out a sausage and flatten it out

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.810 
roll out a sausage and flatten it out
and<00:02:18.230> make<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.380> into<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.650> square<00:02:18.829> shape<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.459> then

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
and make it into a square shape and then

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.979 
and make it into a square shape and then
all<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.299> is<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.750> wrap<00:02:20.959> it

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
all you have to do is just wrap it

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.990 
all you have to do is just wrap it
around<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.380> top<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.829> press<00:02:22.130> firmly<00:02:22.489> again

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
around the top and press firmly again

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.160 
around the top and press firmly again
just<00:02:23.329> like<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.480> did<00:02:23.570> with<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.079> bottom<00:02:24.350> bit

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
just like you did with the bottom bit

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.110 
just like you did with the bottom bit
and<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:27.290> roll<00:02:27.500> out<00:02:27.680> lots<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.100> snakes<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.850> I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and just roll out lots of snakes and I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.199 
and just roll out lots of snakes and I
think<00:02:29.480> thinner<00:02:29.720> than<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:29.989> would<00:02:30.170> be<00:02:30.260> better

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
think thinner than this would be better

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.789 
think thinner than this would be better
so<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.720> another<00:02:32.959> file<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> corrupt<00:02:33.709> so

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
so this is another file that corrupt so

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.410 
so this is another file that corrupt so
I'm<00:02:33.890> going<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.100> show<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.549> Nimbus<00:02:34.820> 2001

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
I'm going to show you on the Nimbus 2001

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.729 
I'm going to show you on the Nimbus 2001
but<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:35.780> take<00:02:35.900> all<00:02:36.079> those<00:02:36.200> snakes<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> you

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
but just take all those snakes that you

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.250 
but just take all those snakes that you
made<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.190> place<00:02:37.910> them<00:02:38.180> on<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.720> bottom<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
made and place them on the bottom of the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.900 
made and place them on the bottom of the
broom<00:02:39.470> don't<00:02:39.739> do<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.370> bit<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.820> we

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
broom don't do it on that bit that we

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.870 
broom don't do it on that bit that we
put<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.650> second<00:02:42.950> ago<00:02:43.040> because<00:02:43.700> it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
put on just a second ago because it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.729 
put on just a second ago because it
won't<00:02:44.060> look<00:02:44.329> quite<00:02:44.390> right<00:02:44.660> but<00:02:45.320> only<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.650> have

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
won't look quite right but only one have

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.170 
won't look quite right but only one have
to<00:02:45.829> use<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.010> exactly<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.489> just<00:02:46.760> take<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.000> off

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
to use it exactly now just take it off

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.000 
to use it exactly now just take it off
with<00:02:47.329> your<00:02:47.540> thumb<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.530> doesn't<00:02:48.769> have<00:02:48.859> to<00:02:48.950> be

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
with your thumb it doesn't have to be

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.380 
with your thumb it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:49.459> that's<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.880> think<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.299> whole

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
perfect that's I think it's the whole

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.970 
perfect that's I think it's the whole
point<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.049> doesn't<00:02:51.200> look<00:02:51.410> perfect<00:02:51.590> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
point that it doesn't look perfect and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.280 
point that it doesn't look perfect and
just<00:02:52.040> keep<00:02:52.609> doing<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.329> you'll<00:02:54.140> get

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
just keep doing this and you'll get

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.490 
just keep doing this and you'll get
something<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:54.769> this

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
something like this

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560 
something like this
once<00:02:57.400> you've<00:02:57.520> done<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.850> or<00:02:57.970> look<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.330> this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
once you've done that or look like this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.510 
once you've done that or look like this
then<00:02:59.110> what<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.380> want<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.590> do<00:02:59.740> is<00:02:59.980> take<00:03:00.250> your

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
then what you want to do is take your

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.460 
then what you want to do is take your
exacto<00:03:01.060> knife<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.420> start<00:03:01.720> adding<00:03:01.870> texture

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
exacto knife and start adding texture

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.350 
exacto knife and start adding texture
just<00:03:02.710> by<00:03:02.830> pulling<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.670> knife<00:03:03.820> along<00:03:04.090> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
just by pulling the knife along and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
just by pulling the knife along and
you'll<00:03:04.510> get<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:04.750> really<00:03:04.990> amazing<00:03:05.140> texture

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
you'll get this really amazing texture

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.860 
you'll get this really amazing texture
so<00:03:06.670> once<00:03:06.910> you've<00:03:07.060> done<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.570> should<00:03:07.750> look

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
so once you've done that it should look

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.420 
so once you've done that it should look
like<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.470> then<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.680> want<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.890> do<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.160> for

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
like this and then you want to do it for

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.950 
like this and then you want to do it for
the<00:03:09.730> little<00:03:10.120> square<00:03:10.420> bit<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:10.780> added

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
the little square bit that we added

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.660 
the little square bit that we added
earlier<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.830> use<00:03:11.980> your<00:03:12.010> snake<00:03:12.370> sand

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
earlier so just use your snake sand

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.949 
earlier so just use your snake sand
texture

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.630 

now<00:03:19.959> roll<00:03:20.140> out<00:03:20.319> some<00:03:20.530> gold<00:03:20.800> clay<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.310> then<00:03:21.430> cut

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
now roll out some gold clay and then cut

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.750 
now roll out some gold clay and then cut
it<00:03:21.670> using<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.150> knife<00:03:22.330> or<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.170> blade<00:03:23.530> into<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.370> nice

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
it using a knife or a blade into a nice

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.180 
it using a knife or a blade into a nice
clean<00:03:25.180> rectangle<00:03:25.720> with<00:03:25.810> straight<00:03:26.080> edges<00:03:26.440> now

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
clean rectangle with straight edges now

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.740 
clean rectangle with straight edges now
I've<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.459> used<00:03:27.610> indents<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:28.390> what<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.599> want

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
I've just used indents but what you want

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.660 
I've just used indents but what you want
to<00:03:28.810> do<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.110> make<00:03:29.260> one<00:03:29.290> large<00:03:29.770> one<00:03:30.190> medium<00:03:30.550> and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
to do is make one large one medium and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.330 
to do is make one large one medium and
one<00:03:30.760> small<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.540> strip<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.500> gold<00:03:32.800> clay<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
one small and strip of gold clay the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130 
one small and strip of gold clay the
indents<00:03:33.580> really<00:03:33.819> help<00:03:34.000> me<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:34.750> probably

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
indents really help me so it's probably

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.479 
indents really help me so it's probably
best<00:03:35.350> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.650> do<00:03:35.770> that<00:03:35.920> but<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.190> don't<00:03:36.280> have

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
best if you do that but you don't have

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.000 
best if you do that but you don't have
to<00:03:38.819> now<00:03:39.819> using<00:03:40.239> those<00:03:40.390> strips<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.840> gold<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.410> so

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
to now using those strips of gold and so

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.530 
to now using those strips of gold and so
the<00:03:42.130> large<00:03:42.280> one<00:03:42.580> comes<00:03:42.819> first<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.360> all<00:03:43.450> you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540

the large one comes first but all you
want<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.050> wrap<00:03:44.319> them<00:03:44.560> around<00:03:44.590> now<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.280> use
