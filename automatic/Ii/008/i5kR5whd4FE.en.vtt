00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
computer you get earth up and running

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369

just<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.420> Mega<00:00:45.660> Man<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.620> idea<00:00:46.710> for

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
just like Mega Man it's a good idea for

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
just like Mega Man it's a good idea for
a<00:00:47.100> game<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.670> done<00:00:47.850> pretty<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a game and it's done pretty well the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
a game and it's done pretty well the
exploration<00:00:49.379> aspect<00:00:49.829> makes<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> stand<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:50.610> in

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
exploration aspect makes it stand out in

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
exploration aspect makes it stand out in
the<00:00:50.910> NES<00:00:51.180> library<00:00:51.870> however<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:52.829> tough<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the NES library however it was tough to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.400 
the NES library however it was tough to
do<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> Metroid<00:00:53.969> style<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
do a Metroid style like this back then I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.040 
do a Metroid style like this back then I
mean<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.800> look<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.780> Metroid<00:00:57.780> for

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
mean just look at the Metroid for

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
mean just look at the Metroid for
example<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:59.010> hasn't<00:00:59.190> held<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.640> well

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
example it just hasn't held up well

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.880 
example it just hasn't held up well
because<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.600> easy<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.140> lost<00:01:01.410> that's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
because it's so easy to get lost that's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
because it's so easy to get lost that's
another<00:01:02.190> video<00:01:02.370> altogether<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.239> yeah

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
another video altogether but yeah

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
another video altogether but yeah

powerblade suffers from the same flaw

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.950 
powerblade suffers from the same flaw
first<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> find<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> guy<00:01:06.630> who<00:01:06.689> gives

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
first you got to find the guy who gives

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
first you got to find the guy who gives
you<00:01:07.140> access<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.740> secret<00:01:08.130> room<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you access to a secret room and then you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.490 
you access to a secret room and then you
got<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> find<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> secret<00:01:09.630> room<00:01:09.780> itself<00:01:10.229> and

got to find the secret room itself and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
got to find the secret room itself and
it's<00:01:10.619> very<00:01:10.950> time-consuming<00:01:11.280> you'll<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it's very time-consuming you'll be

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's very time-consuming you'll be

is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> huge<00:01:45.810> grid<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.530> Metroid<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.280> think

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
is a huge grid like in Metroid you think

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
is a huge grid like in Metroid you think
you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> fall<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.600> area<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:49.710> the

you can fall from one area down into the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
you can fall from one area down into the
next<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> pits<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.270> treated<00:01:51.630> just

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
next but the pits here are treated just

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.480 
next but the pits here are treated just
like<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.470> side-scroller<00:01:53.130> that's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.429 
like they are in a side-scroller that's
kind<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> puzzling<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.810> remedied<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
kind of puzzling this is remedied in the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.310 
kind of puzzling this is remedied in the
sequel<00:01:55.860> powerblade<00:01:56.460> -<00:01:56.700> also<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.390> nes<00:01:57.750> however

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
sequel powerblade - also for nes however
that<00:01:58.560> game<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.130> linear<00:01:59.670> and

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
that game is much more linear and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
that game is much more linear and
streamlined<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> result<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> comes

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
streamlined and as a result it comes

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
streamlined and as a result it comes
across<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:01.890> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> generic<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.210> the
