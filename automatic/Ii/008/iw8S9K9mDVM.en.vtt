00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.800 
I gotta know how else to explain this
it's<00:01:09.600> simply<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.740> pushed<00:01:11.040> over<00:01:11.189> okay

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so if the iphone 4 case does not fit the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
so if the iphone 4 case does not fit the
verizon<00:01:16.799> model<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.310> will<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.150> fit<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
verizon model it will not fit the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
verizon model it will not fit the
verizon<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.500> iphone<00:01:20.009> 4s<00:01:20.460> model<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.030> any

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
iphone 4s is going to be exact replica

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.550 
iphone 4s is going to be exact replica
of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.200> item<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.860> verizon<00:01:29.369> iphone<00:01:29.490> 4<00:01:30.060> okay<00:01:30.560> so
