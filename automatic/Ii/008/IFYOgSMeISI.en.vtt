00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.720
 the Bible 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.689
 for hundreds of years this has been the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.720
 most famous book in the history of the 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.669
 humanity has been sold approximately 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.680
 6 billion times around the world 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.430
 and it was the first book to be printed by 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.430
 gutenberg 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.820
 but what makes this book so special 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.500
 book supposedly dictated by god with 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.290
 the one that gives humanity a code 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.360
 moral and explanations of his creation as well 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.060
 as answers to absolutely everything 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.370
 according to this book God is the creator of 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.410
 the whole universe an omnipotent being that 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.950
 He has written all your life since before 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.950
 that was born 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.250
 but even the book talks about the most 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.250
 big mistake that God made 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.380
 before creating man in a world 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.360
 physical created the angels to be is 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.450
 extremely beautiful whose sole purpose 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.910
 was to meet their needs between 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.860
 they decided to create lucifer an angel 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.530
 that was superior in every way to the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 others this angel was so smart that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 he realized that he did not have a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.700
 purpose was mentally bound to the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.360
 God's demands and then he decided 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.360
 to rebel 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.890
 after this in the bible is followed 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.770
 talking about lucifer no longer as an angel 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 but as a demon with horns 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.610
 blaming him for all the evil in the world 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.080
 and even giving him a job to punish 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.080
 all sinful humans 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 God decided to create the human being now 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.320
 in a physical world and decided to give them a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.229
 book to explain all their history 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.270
 the bible the book that for thousands of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.909
 years was the moral code of the human being 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.439
 but what would you think if I told you that the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.439
 Devil also has a book 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.380
 known as codex gigas this book is 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.330
 the manu has written greatest medieval 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.100
 of the world and is also known as the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.229
 bible of the devil because of its huge 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.770
 illustration of a demon and the legend 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.770
 of his creation 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.810
 it is believed that it was written by the monk 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.970
 German inmate in the 13th century who 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.310
 He was sentenced to be walled 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.409
 that he violated his vows as monk this 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.299
 type of medieval torture consisted of 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.189
 be abandoned in a wooden box in 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.470
 the desert from which it was impossible to 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.989
 come out one of the worst sentences that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.970
 could receive a man so the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.790
 German monk decided to make a proposal 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.530
 asked to be saved by offering to create a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.689
 book in a single night that glorify 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.180
 to the monastery forever the monastery 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:48.250
 decided to accept his proposal so the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.250
 monk set out to write the book 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.770
 but after several hours of arduous 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.260
 work the monk realized that no 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.880
 could complete his mission and at twelve 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.300
 at night decided to make a prayer 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.250
 special a prayer that was not addressed 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.380
 God but the fallen angel Lucifer 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.390
 asking him to help him finish the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 book in exchange for his soul 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.130
 the devil decided to help him and in gratitude 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.310
 of the monk added his image in the first 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.310
 page 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.829
 the truth is that the book is extremely 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.400
 shocking even if you ignore the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.650
 Legend of his creation 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.049
 to complete this book a person 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.819
 I would have to write non-stop for 5 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.409
 years and let's not talk about the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.120
 illustrations that have a value of 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.520
 undeniable perfection for any 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.680
 historian 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.260
 the content of this book is in its 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.300
 most of the bible the rest are just 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.070
 fragments in Latin and the writings of 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.230
 apostles and the revelation that are 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.700
 written in a vulgar way as soon as 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.700
 Literary value refers to 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.560
 as a conclusion I do not believe in the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.100
 veracity of the bible or of the Koran or in 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.290
 Torah 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.150
 but I decided to make this video because the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.950
 literary value of the gigas codex is 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.140
 impossible to deny for any 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.410
 person who appreciates art and its legend 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.480
 it's extremely interesting I hope that you 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.100
 have liked this little video and happy 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.100
 Tuesday 13 until later
