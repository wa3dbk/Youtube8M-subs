00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
okay what we do with halter training is

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.499 
okay what we do with halter training is
we<00:00:03.949> start<00:00:04.279> them<00:00:04.490> out<00:00:04.669> when<00:00:04.850> they're<00:00:04.970> about<00:00:05.209> two

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
we start them out when they're about two

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.690 
we start them out when they're about two
months<00:00:05.750> old<00:00:05.870> where<00:00:06.589> we<00:00:06.709> just<00:00:06.919> put<00:00:06.979> the<00:00:07.249> halters

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
months old where we just put the halters

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.150 
months old where we just put the halters
on<00:00:07.910> them<00:00:08.149> and<00:00:08.719> we<00:00:08.809> do<00:00:08.960> that<00:00:09.170> for<00:00:09.440> a<00:00:09.469> few<00:00:09.710> days<00:00:09.889> so

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
on them and we do that for a few days so

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.680 
on them and we do that for a few days so
that<00:00:10.190> they<00:00:10.460> get<00:00:10.610> accustomed<00:00:11.150> to<00:00:11.240> having<00:00:11.420> that

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
that they get accustomed to having that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.709 
that they get accustomed to having that
halter<00:00:12.110> on<00:00:12.139> their<00:00:12.469> muzzle<00:00:13.419> just<00:00:14.419> a<00:00:14.509> couple

halter on their muzzle just a couple
minutes<00:00:15.169> -<00:00:15.440> it's<00:00:15.620> not<00:00:15.799> a<00:00:15.830> long<00:00:16.190> period<00:00:16.640> of<00:00:16.670> time

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
minutes - it's not a long period of time

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.490 
minutes - it's not a long period of time
not<00:00:17.090> of<00:00:17.270> halter<00:00:17.630> training<00:00:17.780> lasts<00:00:18.230> for<00:00:18.470> very

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500

not of halter training lasts for very
long<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:19.190> then<00:00:19.940> what<00:00:20.540> what<00:00:20.960> we<00:00:21.170> do<00:00:21.440> is<00:00:21.850> we<00:00:22.850> take

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
long and then what what we do is we take

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.660 
long and then what what we do is we take
them<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.050> babies<00:00:24.410> out<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:24.800> their<00:00:24.980> moms<00:00:25.220> and

get used to the halter the lead and a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.099 
get used to the halter the lead and a
person<00:00:36.800> walking<00:00:37.429> next<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.730> them<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.269> giving

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
them commands and then after they have

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.369 
them commands and then after they have
that<00:00:42.649> done<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.390> actually<00:00:44.390> Evita<00:00:44.749> was<00:00:44.870> very

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
that done and actually Evita was very

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.520 
that done and actually Evita was very
very<00:00:45.649> easy<00:00:45.769> to<00:00:46.129> halter<00:00:46.460> train<00:00:47.109> after<00:00:48.109> that

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
very easy to halter train after that

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.119 
very easy to halter train after that
though<00:00:48.829> we<00:00:49.100> may<00:00:49.339> take<00:00:49.579> them<00:00:49.820> with<00:00:50.030> another

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
in halt in being halter trained and walk

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.380 
in halt in being halter trained and walk
with<00:00:56.839> them<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.440> then<00:00:58.249> after<00:00:58.940> when<00:00:59.089> they<00:00:59.210> get

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
on on our right and this is this is sit

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.730 
on on our right and this is this is sit
right<00:01:16.490> here<00:01:16.550> we<00:01:17.180> use<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.390> loose<00:01:17.750> lead<00:01:18.110> so

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
right here we use a loose lead so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.330 
right here we use a loose lead so
there's<00:01:19.010> no<00:01:19.280> pulling<00:01:20.150> no<00:01:20.810> force<00:01:21.290> at<00:01:21.560> all<00:01:21.920> it's

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
there's no pulling no force at all it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.270 
there's no pulling no force at all it's
all<00:01:22.700> where<00:01:23.480> they're<00:01:23.840> learning<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:24.710> we<00:01:24.950> want

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
all where they're learning what we want

all where they're learning what we want
and<00:01:25.700> we<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.270> back<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.480> that<00:01:26.630> trust<00:01:27.080> factor

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
and we going back to that trust factor

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.370 
and we going back to that trust factor
again<00:01:27.950> they<00:01:28.670> trust<00:01:29.060> us<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.330> they<00:01:29.960> know<00:01:30.170> we're

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
again they trust us and they know we're

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.620 
again they trust us and they know we're
not<00:01:30.590> going<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.190> take<00:01:31.460> them<00:01:31.700> places<00:01:32.240> or<00:01:32.420> do

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
not going to take them places or do

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.740 
not going to take them places or do
things<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.110> them<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.980> would<00:01:34.160> hurt<00:01:34.370> them

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
things to them that would hurt them

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.300 
things to them that would hurt them
another<00:01:35.750> thing<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:36.140> try<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.440> do<00:01:36.680> is<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.070> take

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
another thing we try to do is to take

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.120 
another thing we try to do is to take
them<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:38.420> as<00:01:38.690> many<00:01:38.960> new<00:01:39.290> places<00:01:39.800> as<00:01:39.980> possible

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
them to as many new places as possible

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.000 
them to as many new places as possible
when<00:01:40.760> we're<00:01:40.910> halter<00:01:41.270> training<00:01:41.690> so<00:01:42.410> that<00:01:42.440> they

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
when we're halter training so that they

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.300 
when we're halter training so that they
don't<00:01:43.550> get<00:01:43.880> alarmed<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:44.750> something

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
don't get alarmed when something

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.310 
don't get alarmed when something
different<00:01:46.310> happens<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.120> process<00:01:47.330> we'll

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
different happens in this process we'll

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.230 
different happens in this process we'll
take<00:01:48.620> them<00:01:48.860> all<00:01:49.100> through<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.550> pastures<00:01:50.000> and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
take them all through the pastures and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.330 
take them all through the pastures and
walk<00:01:50.450> them<00:01:50.720> on<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.960> pastures<00:01:51.410> different

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
walk them on the pastures different

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.280 
walk them on the pastures different
directions<00:01:52.940> we'll<00:01:53.420> take<00:01:53.630> them<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> road

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
directions we'll take them on the road

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.530 
directions we'll take them on the road
and<00:01:54.320> walk<00:01:54.740> them<00:01:54.980> in<00:01:55.100> different<00:01:55.250> directions

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and walk them in different directions

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.160 
and walk them in different directions
