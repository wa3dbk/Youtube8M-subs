bananas<00:00:09.450> problem<00:00:10.670> which<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.410> to<00:00:13.410> find<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.920> eight

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
bananas problem which is to find a eight

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.560 
bananas problem which is to find a eight
digit<00:00:14.940> number<00:00:15.500> that<00:00:18.320> that<00:00:19.320> makes<00:00:20.189> them<00:00:20.570> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
digit number that that makes them that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.050 
digit number that that makes them that
is<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.650> first<00:00:22.920> digits<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
is so that the two first digits like a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.740 
is so that the two first digits like a
and<00:00:24.539> B<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.990> multiple<00:00:25.800> enough<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.609> three<00:00:27.539> first

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and B are multiple enough to three first

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.060 
and B are multiple enough to three first
digits<00:00:28.199> multiple<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.769> three<00:00:29.039> 3<00:00:29.820> four<00:00:30.590> 4<00:00:31.590> first

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
digits multiple of three 3 four 4 first

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.540 
digits multiple of three 3 four 4 first
digits<00:00:32.910> makes<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.420> multiple<00:00:33.860> 4<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.520> on

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
digits makes them multiple 4 and so on

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.930 
digits makes them multiple 4 and so on
so<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.649> do<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.680> we're<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> try<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:41.760> put

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so to do this we're going to try to put

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.900 
so to do this we're going to try to put
all<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> possibilities<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.590> each<00:00:44.040> column<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
all the possibilities on each column so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.160 
all the possibilities on each column so
as<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:46.110> start<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.620> course<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:48.170> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
as we start of course we have all the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
as we start of course we have all the
members<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> 8<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.469> 9<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.870> columns

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
members and 8 and 9 in all the columns

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
members and 8 and 9 in all the columns
which<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.680> present<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> possibilities

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
which we present all the possibilities

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
which we present all the possibilities
that<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.230> taken<00:00:58.469> by<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.539> and<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:01.500> course

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
that can be taken by a and of course

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.410 
that can be taken by a and of course
until<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.149> number<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> digit<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> all

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
until the number the digit I we have all

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.410 
until the number the digit I we have all
the<00:01:06.659> possibilities<00:01:07.369> but<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.580> course<00:01:08.880> we're

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the possibilities but of course we're

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.280 
the possibilities but of course we're
going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.680> very<00:01:10.680> quickly<00:01:12.080> eliminate<00:01:13.080> some

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
going to very quickly eliminate some

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.630 
going to very quickly eliminate some
possibilities<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:14.100> we're<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> do

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
possibilities what we're going to do

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.840 
possibilities what we're going to do
here<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> try<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:16.110> only

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
here we're going to try to use only

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.859 
here we're going to try to use only
logics<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.000> course<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.220> middle<00:01:20.220> school

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
logics of course and middle school

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.160 
logics of course and middle school
mathematics<00:01:22.009> we<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:23.869> though<00:01:24.869> it's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
mathematics we are not using though it's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.340 
mathematics we are not using though it's
of<00:01:25.439> course<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.850> consequence<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.960> we

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
of course it's a consequence of it we

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.760 
of course it's a consequence of it we
are<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.590> using<00:01:28.979> modular<00:01:29.579> arithmetic<00:01:30.770> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
are not using modular arithmetic so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.149 
are not using modular arithmetic so
let's<00:01:32.220> start<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.710> course<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> most

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
let's start with of course the most

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.399 
let's start with of course the most
obvious<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.820> which<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.630> e<00:01:37.159> digit<00:01:39.409> which

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
obvious one which is the e digit which

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
obvious one which is the e digit which
is<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> multiple<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> should<00:01:42.299> make<00:01:42.509> all

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
is a multiple which you should make all

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
is a multiple which you should make all
together<00:01:43.590> ABCDE<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.939> multiple<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> five<00:01:46.320> since

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
together ABCDE a multiple of five since

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.819 
together ABCDE a multiple of five since
it's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> multiple<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.119> five<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.079> finish

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it's a multiple of five it has to finish

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's a multiple of five it has to finish
with<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> five<00:01:51.210> or<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> zero<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.320> don't<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.649> any

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
with a five or a zero we don't have any

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.149 
with a five or a zero we don't have any
zero<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.290> means<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:56.009> have

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
zero here so that means that we can have

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.310 
zero here so that means that we can have
only<00:01:56.390> five<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.790> we<00:01:59.790> know<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.869> column

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
only five so we know that in this column

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.850 
only five so we know that in this column
I<00:02:01.500> mean<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.250> digit<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> thought

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I mean this digit is is a thought

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.920 
I mean this digit is is a thought
which<00:02:07.860> means<00:02:08.100> also<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:09.509> don't<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
which means also that we don't have a

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.520 
which means also that we don't have a
five<00:02:10.460> in<00:02:11.460> there<00:02:11.910> because<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.990> other<00:02:13.080> part<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
five in there because the other part of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
five in there because the other part of
the<00:02:13.650> trick<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.070> we<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.970> use<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the trick is that we have to use all the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.920 
the trick is that we have to use all the
num<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.380> digits<00:02:16.800> from<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.030> nine<00:02:18.240> one

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
num all the digits from one to nine one

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.400 
num all the digits from one to nine one
and<00:02:19.200> only<00:02:19.680> ones<00:02:20.840> one<00:02:21.840> time<00:02:23.180> okay<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
and only ones one time okay that's the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.010 
and only ones one time okay that's the
first<00:02:25.950> step<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.880> second<00:02:27.180> step<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.990> we

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
first step the second step is that we

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.950 
first step the second step is that we
know<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.800> B<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> an<00:02:29.520> even<00:02:29.850> number<00:02:29.960> since

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
know that a B is an even number since

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.110 
know that a B is an even number since
it's<00:02:31.170> an<00:02:31.260> even<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:31.890> an<00:02:32.130> even<00:02:32.430> number<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> has

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
it's an even it's an even number it has

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.949 
it's an even it's an even number it has
to<00:02:33.270> end<00:02:33.300> by<00:02:34.220> two<00:02:35.870> four<00:02:37.040> six<00:02:38.040> seven<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.240> nothing

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
to end by two four six seven and nothing

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.120 
to end by two four six seven and nothing
six<00:02:40.830> sorry<00:02:41.400> eight<00:02:41.970> or<00:02:42.420> zero<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.620> nothing<00:02:43.980> else

six sorry eight or zero and nothing else
once<00:02:44.580> more<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.300> any<00:02:45.510> 0<00:02:45.870> here<00:02:46.380> so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
once more we don't have any 0 here so

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.180 
once more we don't have any 0 here so
that's<00:02:47.730> only<00:02:48.330> two<00:02:48.900> four<00:02:49.320> six<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.920> eight

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that's only two four six and eight

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.820 
that's only two four six and eight
another<00:02:51.030> thing<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:51.360> know<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.170> d<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.709> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
another thing we know is that d is a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.300 
another thing we know is that d is a
multiple<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.430> four<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.060> mean<00:02:54.980> ABCD<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
multiple of four I mean ABCD is a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.240 
multiple of four I mean ABCD is a
multiple<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.910> four<00:02:57.209> which<00:02:57.420> means<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.750> d<00:02:58.740> by

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
multiple of four which means that d by

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.720 
multiple of four which means that d by
itself<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.970> also<00:03:00.660> multiple<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.380> mean<00:03:01.770> ABCD

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
itself is also multiple I mean ABCD

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.680 
itself is also multiple I mean ABCD
being<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.240> multiple<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.780> four<00:03:04.940> ABCD<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.090> also<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
being a multiple of four ABCD is also a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.870 
being a multiple of four ABCD is also a
multiple<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.320> two<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:10.530> column<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.220> we

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
multiple of two so in this column we we

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.410 
multiple of two so in this column we we
have<00:03:12.120> exactly<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.110> same<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:15.090> column

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
have exactly the same as in this column

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.509 
have exactly the same as in this column
because<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> multiple<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.739> two<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.310> it

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
because this is a multiple of two so it

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.110 
because this is a multiple of two so it
has<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.730> end<00:03:17.910> also<00:03:18.720> with<00:03:19.560> by<00:03:19.860> two<00:03:19.920> four<00:03:20.610> six<00:03:20.880> or

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
has to end also with by two four six or

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.930 
has to end also with by two four six or
eight<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.720> with<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.700> same

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
eight and with the same for the same

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.160 
eight and with the same for the same
reason<00:03:25.489> ABCDEF<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:26.940> multiple<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.540> six<00:03:27.900> which

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
reason ABCDEF is a multiple of six which

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.770 
reason ABCDEF is a multiple of six which
means<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.590> also<00:03:28.739> multiple<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.489> 2<00:03:30.120> which

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
means it's also multiple of 2 which

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.160 
means it's also multiple of 2 which
means<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.260> F<00:03:31.470> kin<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:33.239> be<00:03:33.570> only<00:03:33.840> two

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
means that F kin and can be only two

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.009 
means that F kin and can be only two
four<00:03:34.530> six<00:03:34.800> or<00:03:35.070> eight<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.610> we<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> same

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
four six or eight and we have the same

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.560 
four six or eight and we have the same
thing<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> H<00:03:37.950> column<00:03:40.190> now<00:03:41.390> we<00:03:42.390> get

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
thing for the H column now we get

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.210 
thing for the H column now we get
something<00:03:42.840> very<00:03:43.200> interesting<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.860> we're

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
something very interesting because we're

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.440 
something very interesting because we're

multiple 4 etcetera we realize quick

multiple 4 etcetera we realize quick
that<00:06:13.590> in<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:14.310> D<00:06:14.580> column<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:16.650> digit<00:06:17.099> d<00:06:17.580> can<00:06:18.120> be

that in the D column the digit d can be

that in the D column the digit d can be
only

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
only

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.370 
only
2<00:06:19.630> plus<00:06:20.410> 6<00:06:21.990> 2<00:06:22.990> or<00:06:23.230> 6<00:06:23.560> and<00:06:23.890> nothing<00:06:24.370> else<00:06:24.520> and

2 plus 6 2 or 6 and nothing else and

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.890 
2 plus 6 2 or 6 and nothing else and
that's<00:06:26.380> great<00:06:26.560> and<00:06:29.700> we<00:06:30.700> realize<00:06:31.120> also<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.540> in

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
that's great and we realize also that in

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.130 
that's great and we realize also that in
the<00:06:32.910> number<00:06:33.910> until<00:06:34.320> H<00:06:35.320> is<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:35.770> multiple<00:06:36.280> of<00:06:36.430> 8

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
the number until H is a multiple of 8

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.670 
the number until H is a multiple of 8
which<00:06:38.140> means<00:06:38.410> it's<00:06:39.310> also<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:40.000> multiple<00:06:40.420> of<00:06:40.900> 4

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
which means it's also a multiple of 4

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.290 
which means it's also a multiple of 4
which<00:06:42.400> means<00:06:42.670> that<00:06:42.760> we<00:06:42.970> have<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.270> same

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
which means that we have the same

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.070 
which means that we have the same
condition<00:06:44.080> in<00:06:44.470> this<00:06:45.070> column<00:06:45.490> than<00:06:45.940> in<00:06:46.150> that

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
condition in this column than in that

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.370 
condition in this column than in that
column<00:06:47.700> so<00:06:48.700> with<00:06:48.880> the<00:06:48.970> same<00:06:49.210> same<00:06:49.930> reasoning

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
column so with the same same reasoning

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.430 
column so with the same same reasoning
we<00:06:51.040> know<00:06:51.610> that<00:06:51.910> we<00:06:52.390> have<00:06:52.420> only<00:06:52.600> two<00:06:52.930> or<00:06:53.170> six

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
we know that we have only two or six

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.890 
we know that we have only two or six
year<00:06:53.980> since<00:06:54.520> we<00:06:54.670> have<00:06:54.790> two<00:06:55.060> columns<00:06:55.420> used<00:06:55.750> by

year since we have two columns used by
two<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.290> six<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:56.920> means<00:06:57.370> that<00:06:57.460> we<00:06:57.610> don't<00:06:57.820> have

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
two and six it means that we don't have

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.660 
two and six it means that we don't have
any<00:06:58.210> six<00:06:58.510> here<00:06:58.900> and<00:06:59.080> whether<00:06:59.830> we<00:07:00.190> don't<00:07:00.550> have

any six here and whether we don't have

any six here and whether we don't have
any<00:07:00.880> to<00:07:01.120> hear<00:07:01.600> which<00:07:02.140> means<00:07:02.410> we<00:07:02.890> have<00:07:02.980> only

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
any to hear which means we have only

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.430 
any to hear which means we have only
four<00:07:04.360> and<00:07:05.100> eight<00:07:06.100> in<00:07:06.550> this<00:07:07.150> column<00:07:07.570> and<00:07:07.750> of
