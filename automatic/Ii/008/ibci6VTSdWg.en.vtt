00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.419
 but I tell you we're going to talk 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.250
 always as children but now what for 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.560
 they mean a lot of trauma 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.750
 hands I've been writing to the page 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.640
 facebook and in cuts says hear us 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 because it does not address the issue of children 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.750
 in their milk teeth many children 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.580
 they are facing trauma because they do not 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 they are voting spontaneously 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 teeth but they have to go where a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.430
 specialist to be extracted and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 that is a painful thing for them how 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.119
 prevent children from reaching that point 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.470
 see when the mouse arrives 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.470
 teeth to each home 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.040
 when children reach 5 or 6 years 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.080
 your baby teeth start to 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.739
 get rid of their little simple 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.800
 last week I dropped my first 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.600
 good tooth sometimes be a little 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.989
 but he did not hear anything without washing it clean it 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:59.520
 not having them limp that fell by 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:03.920
 accident when he reaches six years I 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.920
 that barclays the client 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.700
 white tooth like nature is 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.369
 I knew while these teeth 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.039
 fall and immediately the teeth arrive 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.140
 permanent a process that should not 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.939
 involve pain but there are children who 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.220
 Unfortunately they suffer because their 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.700
 milk teeth do not fall spontaneously 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.829
 and they should go to a pediatric dentist for 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.500
 that you extract them by becoming a 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.990
 trauma this natural process if applied 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.119
 a good anesthetic is not painful just 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.399
 when there is infection already when the day in 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.830
 that is infected can not be extracted 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.920
 because the anesthesia does not come then 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 you have to give antibiotic first and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.599
 later extract the piece that is 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.420
 have to bring this stage of the children 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:52.090
 must be wonderful and nontraumatic the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.520
 parents we can help a lot by putting 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.310
 attention to your teeth and cough and avoiding 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.310
 that they eat chewing gum or very sweet drinks or 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.200
 acidic 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
 I have a tips for this from the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.119
 teeth we believe the children that fantasy 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.130
 of the little mouse miguel that takes 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.229
 teeth or the tooth fairy for my 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.480
 children that what I do has been giving 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.220
 all the teeth then I visited the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.630
 at night and leaves you 20 pesos under 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.489
 the pillow then he has realized 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.930
 and moves back millionaire then 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.340
 that rather makes them want 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.050
 vote the teeth instead of suffering 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.880
 when they feel without this is already 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.150
 thinking about winning do not do not be 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 common start and thread 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.440
 I do not think it's traumatic for a child 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.350
 talking about the common and those that fall 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.569
 alone and nature is wise and the 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.840
 teeth and they do not fall only if there are people 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.230
 that keeps it and wraps it the way 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.360
 that they are removed is very painful all 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.360
 we went through this truth is true
