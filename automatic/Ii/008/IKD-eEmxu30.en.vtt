00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.010
 yahoo I do not know you but me and a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.170
 thing that annoys me surely tel especially 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.120
 the messages the chains you know there 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 several types of strings 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 so we will start then there is the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.500
 first chain the chain that says it's 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.019
 do not see this message there five people 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 your mother she will die 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:32.759
 you imagine the guy who thinks seriously 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 what it will look like that fucking must 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.770
 that I sent the message to five 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.670
 people if we already believe ah yes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.670
 if not my mother she will die 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.199
 2 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.650
 3 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.820
 4 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.920
 5 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.600
 yes my mother she will not die no but 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.229
 seriously it's completely con believing in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.720
 what seriousness what aprilia 3rd type of 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.760
 chains this is the type of chain that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 lags behind rather happy that's when they 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.640
 say that there are college events 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.010
 kind of blockade or what date is rather 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.010
 happy but hey the person he does 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.510
 why pass strings then 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.790
 it's completely con this chain thing 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.320
 me when I am sent a chain 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.240
 they say passed August 15 that 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.780
 presents stuff like that adds a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 and oral all you want me I the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.259
 never do like that for sure and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.940
 certain that I will not receive a chain and 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.289
 receives nevertheless this is a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.410
 problem we are serious when arrive 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.220

 quiet you're going to do the blockade 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.959
 I do not know I would like 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.360

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.860

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.630
