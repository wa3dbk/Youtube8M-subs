00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
because this lasts a lot longer than

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.740 
because this lasts a lot longer than
lipstick<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.290> could<00:05:11.890> keep<00:05:12.310> reapplying<00:05:12.910> my

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
lipstick like I could keep reapplying my

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.530 
lipstick like I could keep reapplying my
lip<00:05:13.990> gloss<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.470> I<00:05:15.220> could<00:05:15.520> see<00:05:15.790> that<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.300> was

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
lip gloss and I could see that this was

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.270 
lip gloss and I could see that this was
still<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:16.960> like<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.440> color<00:05:17.680> was<00:05:18.010> still

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
still on like the color was still

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.510 
still on like the color was still
present<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:20.380> like<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.919> a<00:05:21.010> lot<00:05:21.040> better<00:05:21.280> than

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
present so I like it a lot better than

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.700 
present so I like it a lot better than
lipstick<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.270> i<00:05:22.300> think<00:05:22.660> i<00:05:22.750> might<00:05:22.900> start<00:05:23.230> trying

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
lipstick so i think i might start trying

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.250 
lipstick so i think i might start trying
to<00:05:23.890> back<00:05:24.070> like<00:05:24.550> do<00:05:24.880> that<00:05:25.090> where<00:05:25.330> lip<00:05:25.900> liners

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
to back like do that where lip liners

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.719 
to back like do that where lip liners
and<00:05:26.470> lip<00:05:26.590> glosses<00:05:26.830> instead<00:05:27.520> of<00:05:28.680> lipsticks<00:05:29.729> and

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
and lip glosses instead of lipsticks and

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.969 
and lip glosses instead of lipsticks and
then<00:05:31.300> my<00:05:31.450> big<00:05:31.720> purchase<00:05:32.260> was<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.560> got<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.740> new
