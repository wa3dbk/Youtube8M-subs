00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and it's just been another vuelven

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.260 
and it's just been another vuelven
really<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.970> life<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:12.090> we

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
really in life because you know as as we

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.059 
really in life because you know as as we
firstly<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.870> stronger<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.620> year<00:02:13.890> by

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
firstly get stronger you know year by

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.980 
firstly get stronger you know year by
young<00:02:14.280> evolve<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.600> only<00:02:15.750> thought

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
young evolve and and you only thought

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.720 
young evolve and and you only thought
about<00:02:16.020> 100<00:02:16.740> meters<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.490> times

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
about 100 meters because the times

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.520 
about 100 meters because the times
directors<00:02:18.660> get<00:02:18.780> broken<00:02:19.050> all<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> time

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
directors get broken all the time

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.960 
directors get broken all the time

a<00:02:45.630> piece<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.220> they<00:02:47.459> all<00:02:47.640> really

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
a piece that we have they all really

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.490 
a piece that we have they all really
progressed<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> continue<00:02:49.410> that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
progressed it and continue that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.650 
progressed it and continue that
development<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.100> he<00:02:50.220> pops<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.640> big<00:02:51.330> debate

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
development if he pops up big debate

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.150 
development if he pops up big debate
with<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.080> next<00:02:52.350> question<00:02:52.709> who<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.070> you
