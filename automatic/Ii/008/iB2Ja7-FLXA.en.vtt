00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 my channel subscribers are finally with me 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.519
 Reached the hands of a full review of the game 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.030
 gta san andreas 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.429
 yes that game which is considered well 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.369
 ambiguous but still improve among 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 of the whole gta series of course in many ways with her 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.270
 can compete 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 still his city but it's not about her but about 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.580
 gta san andreas our disposal for 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 those who do not know the whole three huge even 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 not the city well until the city of moulin say three 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 vast territories 3 imagine how 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.780
 it was basically one divided into 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.480
 the two halves here are really huge 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.820
 space is not something that a foot 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.340
 even by car is quite difficult 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.980
 to travel and the task is not easy 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.719
 a huge number of kilometers that in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
 This game is still of course unusual 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.570
 it is unusual that this is a game world which 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.030
 lives by itself and here is the game I played 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 wounded computer years probably 6 tons 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 back about five and can say 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 that in this game there are so many 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.880
 items assembled and racing and shooter but 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.220
 just not first person and walker and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.110
 character can be pumped for example 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 literally can be done to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.430
 the staff was thicker stage 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.140
 more feed can be done so that he 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.770
 was more strongly needed to engage in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.840
 the gym 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.400
 even girls appear here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 virtual that is which you need it 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.490
 shorter dance with them 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.310
 Generally kleda game I definitely when 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 I played on a computer for a long time for a long time have it 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.390
 I slowed down a bit more by the way 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.939
 in general it seemed to me something simple 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.649
 extraordinarily and now getting the same 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.439
 same thing on the tablet the same feelings 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.070
 comes back yes it's cool it's the same 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.580
 the most 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.500
 years san andreas absolutely that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.410
 the very same huge city in which 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.260
 possible and not only by car 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.950
 move around but also by helicopters on 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.200
 airplanes of course the airfield later 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.080
 you can work as a train driver 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.760
 working as a cop one of my 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.399
 favorite missions have always been in vice city 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.560
 here it is possible to police 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.900
 a cop can be doctors for example people 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.180
 rescue and medics i recommend by the way i 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.210
 here is one place on one of 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.050
 islands and in this place she seems to be 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.000
 so there is a hospital and the meaning is that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.459
 you are far away in your car 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.680
 you exactly stay there and constantly 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.440
 save people earn money i'm up 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.780
 he didn't even get close here in this 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.270
 Here on the tablet I play shows 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.880
 article on google nexus 7 13 years on 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.770
 its further before this mission is far a 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.459
 so the most important thing that you can be 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.740
 interesting 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.570
 control is very convenient that the camera we 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.850
 we bring it away with two fingers 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.400
 Of course, you can configure enough 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.160
 the fruit they are here you can manage just 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.459
 here is one of these machines 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.320
 they are distant doctors it is just a van 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.780
 Well, let us then hijack him good 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.410
 gta game this is different and you can take 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.540
 calmly steal absolutely any car 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.120
 imagine generally cool incredibly well 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.060
 for those who like wow you typed in 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.950
 here I am grieving that the game lives 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.160
 your life you can take a motorcycle and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.890
 drive through all cities in fact this 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.510
 very exciting and interesting you can 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.730
 anything you can just pass 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.290
 the mission can be further closer to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.840
 probably will appear in the middle of the game 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.610
 opportunity 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.019
 will need to fight gangs with others 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.480
 and grab as much as possible 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.780
 the territory is really interesting 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.880
 carter all will be your green that is 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.150
 space for creativity for those who love 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.250
 such games are incredibly huge three 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.230
 vast areas that are on foot 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.970
 offend well, just unreal 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.000
 it seems to me even the most patient 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.730
 human patience just run out on foot 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.900
 and drive it all there are mountains 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.330
 have a casino 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.159
 that is, a huge amount in a casino where 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.440
 you can even play gambling 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.690
 but this is generally here we are by the way here we are 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.180
 by the way at mountain races in one of 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.940
 missions see tommy versetti is not 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.610
 wrong character in the game is not gta 3 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.160
 It is necessary to carry exactly 3 with it 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.120
 let them compete well, I can say 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.079
 definitely 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.150
 download the game I bought the game by the way for 200 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.490
 rubles a toad of course choked but thought 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.220
 what's there for free 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.800
 you can download it calmly 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.030
 we have so easy to buy from 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.190
 feel just somehow 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.470
 a strange man why did I not 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.330
 it is clear well bought bought ok let 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.780
 developers penny just does not fall 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.940
 I hope that it will fall from this money 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.160
 now it remains to show you the menu 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.039
 Gameplay can be described for hours 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.870
 very long but i don't do as 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.360
 called power spray tractor by the way 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.490
 even there is generally generally a cool thing but 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.260
 braked nothing cool just 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.080
 the fact that there is a structor is interesting 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.060
 well then let's see the game will come out 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.430
 menu, look at the settings 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.970
 big enough damn no settings 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.860
 quite a large number and now I 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.010
 show you automatically out of them 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.310
 let me go 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.310
 and very important of course important 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.330
 component that creates the atmosphere 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.050
 exactly on 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.990
 and Greg is a series when it is of course sound 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.669
 it's from a radio receiver that catches 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.440
 the set in the stations is the only thing for me 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.900
 still in vais city music like 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.880
 somewhat more or nostalgia just 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.370
 tortured the fact that wai city was the first 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.580
 a game that captured me remember 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.750
 there just 10 years ago ten years 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.240
 eight back 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.280
 played with brother and friends got there 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.680
 it was very creepy interesting here the same 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.590
 the very music of the 90s is playing 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.599
 Player Settings Management 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.729
 we can drink quite a different option 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.279
 to dislike button, you can still then 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.139
 virtual joystick well ok metro power 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.889
 can I manage if I don’t personally 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:06.710
 I like the camera as shown 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.020
 Fingers customizable by game settings 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.710
 of course there is traffic can be configured 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.270
 strong weak average avtopritsel possible 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.849
 the camera well it 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.249
 vibration turn off further on 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.439
 settings we have below the display here 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.360
 there is already brightness can make effects 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.819
 adjust if the game will slowly these 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.219
 then you can make them smaller and range 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.589
 drawing permissions and everything else but 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.649
 my nexus 7 unfortunately big on 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:34.639
 maximum settings, it is several 

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:36.830
 slows down can show someone 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.889
 I wonder if we put high-high 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.139
 and go in the game we add in principle 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:46.370
 it all remains sound settings and 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.169
 setting the language all so we go then 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.289
 ok, resume and see for yourself 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.520
 because we are nexus 5 on which i 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:54.229
 just did a review 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.919
 there it is at maximum settings 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:00.409
 it is in the dirt itself that goes without problems on 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:04.490
 My Naxos 7 is not weak too 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:08.629
 devices and doom the 44 new feet for a little 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.490
 see for yourself a little bit at all if 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.699
 Anyone interested, I plan to do a review 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.399
 on your nexus tell what you like 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.610
 I don't like it 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:21.409
 somewhat heavy she moved 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.129
 You can play but in my opinion as it is not 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.129
 very perfect 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.230
 ride a little more 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.660
 that is, removing a little detail there 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:41.090
 slightly result becomes a little 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:43.850
 better oh well I think fast enough 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.460
 thank you all thank you developers 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.930
 this wonderful lexus game i 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.690
 I am going to review a week through 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:53.420
 two fingers still remain here 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:56.030
 about the fact that I like that I do not like in it 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:59.170
 so the review is sure to be alright 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.170
 all happy to new releases
