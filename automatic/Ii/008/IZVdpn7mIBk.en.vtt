experiences<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> classroom<00:02:09.330> usually

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
experiences in the classroom usually

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.449 
experiences in the classroom usually
come<00:02:10.080> from<00:02:10.260> having<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:10.770> good<00:02:10.979> professor

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
come from having a really good professor

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.400 
come from having a really good professor
sometimes<00:02:12.060> people<00:02:12.360> may<00:02:12.630> look<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.990> U<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.230> I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
sometimes people may look at the U of I

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.410 
sometimes people may look at the U of I
and<00:02:13.709> see<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.240> big

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and see like that it's a really big

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.000 
and see like that it's a really big
institution<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.320> hard<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.709> connect

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
institution and it's hard to connect

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.440 
institution and it's hard to connect
with<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.280> professors<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.209> if<00:02:18.330> you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
with your professors but I think if you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.970 
with your professors but I think if you
really<00:02:18.660> make<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> effort<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.440> take<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.770> time

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
really make the effort and take the time

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
really make the effort and take the time
to<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.310> into<00:02:20.520> their<00:02:20.640> office<00:02:20.670> hours<00:02:21.180> they'll

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
to go into their office hours they'll

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.630 
to go into their office hours they'll
make<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.140> same<00:02:22.380> effort<00:02:22.560> back<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.550> in

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
make that same effort back to be in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.980 
make that same effort back to be in
touch<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.630> make<00:02:24.810> some

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
touch with you and you can make some

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.220 
touch with you and you can make some
really<00:02:25.140> good<00:02:25.459> contacts<00:02:26.570> we<00:02:27.570> take<00:02:27.810> teaching

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
really good contacts we take teaching

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.960 
really good contacts we take teaching
very<00:02:28.500> very<00:02:28.709> seriously<00:02:29.070> it's<00:02:29.459> something<00:02:29.820> that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
very very seriously it's something that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.540 
very very seriously it's something that
a<00:02:30.209> lot<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.600> time<00:02:30.870> spent<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.190> just

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
a lot of time spent on it it's not just

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.580 
a lot of time spent on it it's not just
a<00:02:32.730> second<00:02:33.540> thought<00:02:33.720> after<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> research

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
a second thought after the research

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.680 
a second thought after the research
actually<00:02:34.920> teaching<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.690> equivalently

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
actually teaching is equivalently

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.060 
actually teaching is equivalently
important<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> research<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
important to the research that

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.040 
important to the research that
combination<00:02:38.459> means<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.330> get<00:02:39.540> these

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
combination means that you get these

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.949 
combination means that you get these
world-class<00:02:40.470> infinite<00:02:41.370> opportunities

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
world-class infinite opportunities

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.210 
world-class infinite opportunities
encapsulated<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.440> place<00:02:43.650> where<00:02:43.890> teaching

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
encapsulated in a place where teaching

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.009 
encapsulated in a place where teaching
is<00:02:44.670> great<00:02:44.910> we're<00:02:45.300> talking<00:02:45.690> about<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
is great we're talking about the

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.630 
is great we're talking about the
exciting<00:02:46.200> developments<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.040> our<00:02:47.489> own

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
exciting developments in our own

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.370 
exciting developments in our own
research<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.180> our<00:02:48.269> own<00:02:48.390> lab<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:48.959> i<00:02:49.019> think<00:02:49.110> we

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
research in our own lab so i think we

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.430 
research in our own lab so i think we
try<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.830> share<00:02:50.100> with<00:02:50.250> them<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.170> rigor<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.260> we

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
try to share with them the rigor that we

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.960 
try to share with them the rigor that we
bring<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> our<00:02:52.769> subject<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.370> also<00:02:53.519> hopefully

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
bring to our subject can also hopefully

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.670 
bring to our subject can also hopefully
spawn<00:02:54.450> creative<00:02:54.900> thoughts<00:02:55.110> on<00:02:55.320> them<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
spawn creative thoughts on them that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.949 
spawn creative thoughts on them that
then<00:02:56.100> led<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> discussion<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> health

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
then led to a discussion of the health

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.930 
then led to a discussion of the health
care<00:02:58.230> system<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> end<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.790> class

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
care system and at the end of the class

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.210 
care system and at the end of the class
and<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.480> was<00:03:00.690> really<00:03:00.959> cool<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and that was really cool one of the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.400 
and that was really cool one of the
students<00:03:02.610> came<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.390> me<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.750> shook<00:03:03.989> my<00:03:04.170> hand

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
students came up to me and shook my hand

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.370 
students came up to me and shook my hand
and<00:03:04.709> said<00:03:05.060> professor<00:03:06.060> Herbert<00:03:06.239> thank<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.140> so

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
and said professor Herbert thank you so

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.050 
and said professor Herbert thank you so
much<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:07.860> letting<00:03:07.920> us<00:03:08.160> talk<00:03:08.459> about<00:03:08.820> this

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
much for letting us talk about this

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.330 
much for letting us talk about this
because<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.780> matters<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.739> us<00:03:10.769> but

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
because this really matters to us but

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.940 
because this really matters to us but
you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.610> still<00:03:11.700> explore<00:03:12.120> this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
you can still explore this

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.860 
you can still explore this
and<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.520> is<00:03:13.640> really<00:03:13.790> what<00:03:13.879> I<00:03:14.060> try<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.330> do<00:03:14.660> in

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
and this is really what I try to do in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.990 
and this is really what I try to do in
my<00:03:15.050> classes<00:03:15.400> emphasize<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.580> something<00:03:16.970> that

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
my classes emphasize that something that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.580 
my classes emphasize that something that
you<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:17.629> not<00:03:17.750> something<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.349> watch

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
you do it's not something that you watch

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.410 
you do it's not something that you watch
or<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.950> listen<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:20.000> you're<00:03:20.180> really

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
or you listen to it that you're really

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.759 
or you listen to it that you're really
going<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.900> something<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.440> by<00:03:21.590> doing

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
going to do something and by doing

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.869 
going to do something and by doing
something<00:03:22.099> you're<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.580> change

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
something you're going to change

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.790 
something you're going to change
yourself<00:03:23.060> basically<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.319> way<00:03:24.440> research

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
yourself basically the way research

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.710
