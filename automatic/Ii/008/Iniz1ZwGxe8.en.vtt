kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> struggle<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> put<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:53.039> using

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
kind of struggle to put it on just using

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.619 
kind of struggle to put it on just using
the<00:00:53.489> applicator<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.030> always<00:00:54.239> find<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.480> I've

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the applicator I always find that I've

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
the applicator I always find that I've
put<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.840> too<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.500> gets<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:56.340> bit

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
put on too much and it gets a little bit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
put on too much and it gets a little bit
messy<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> always<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.780> end<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.050> using<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
messy so I always just end up using a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
messy so I always just end up using a
lip<00:00:58.469> brush<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:58.949> finger<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> smooth

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
lip brush or my finger to kind of smooth

lip brush or my finger to kind of smooth
it<00:00:59.969> over<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.289> easiest<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.680> I've

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it over and that's the easiest way I've

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.709

found<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> apply<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.090> super

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
that it didn't make me itchy so I

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.060 
that it didn't make me itchy so I
decided<00:06:33.300> to<00:06:33.450> buy<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.020> full<00:06:34.380> size<00:06:34.620> now<00:06:34.890> this

decided to buy the full size now this

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.650 
decided to buy the full size now this

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.990 
does still have that ingredient I'm
allergic<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:37.080> but

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
allergic to but

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.700 
allergic to but
listed<00:06:38.420> as<00:06:38.570> like<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:38.870> fifth<00:06:39.140> or<00:06:39.350> sixth

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
listed as like the fifth or sixth

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.880 
listed as like the fifth or sixth
ingredient<00:06:40.010> and<00:06:40.550> it's<00:06:41.120> obviously<00:06:41.420> a<00:06:41.810> lot<00:06:42.170> like

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
ingredient and it's obviously a lot like

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.010 
ingredient and it's obviously a lot like
a<00:06:42.920> much<00:06:43.160> lower<00:06:43.580> dose<00:06:44.030> compared<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:44.600> your<00:06:44.750> full

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
a much lower dose compared to your full

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.930 
a much lower dose compared to your full
normal<00:06:45.590> fake<00:06:45.800> tan<00:06:46.040> this<00:06:46.190> is<00:06:46.370> just<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:46.610> gradual

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
normal fake tan this is just a gradual

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.970 
normal fake tan this is just a gradual
tan<00:06:47.150> so<00:06:47.360> it<00:06:47.510> has<00:06:48.200> a<00:06:48.230> lot<00:06:48.410> less<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:48.860> I<00:06:48.920> think

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
tan so it has a lot less and I think

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.650 
tan so it has a lot less and I think
that<00:06:49.160> is<00:06:49.280> wife<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:49.910> is<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.180> reason<00:06:50.330> why<00:06:50.630> I

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
that is wife that is the reason why I

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.110 
that is wife that is the reason why I
haven't<00:06:51.110> had<00:06:51.320> an<00:06:51.680> allergic<00:06:51.860> reaction<00:06:52.130> yet

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.580 
and actually only bought this one less
than<00:07:35.030> week<00:07:35.210> ago<00:07:35.419> um<00:07:35.690> Priceline<00:07:35.990> currently<00:07:36.500> has

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590 
than week ago um Priceline currently has

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.020 
than week ago um Priceline currently has
fifty<00:07:36.919> percent<00:07:37.160> off<00:07:37.310> so<00:07:37.490> really<00:07:37.700> been<00:07:37.820> using

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.030 
fifty percent off so really been using

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.520 
fifty percent off so really been using
this<00:07:38.120> for<00:07:38.180> a<00:07:38.330> couple<00:07:38.450> days<00:07:38.720> so<00:07:38.960> I<00:07:39.320> probably

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:39.530 
this for a couple days so I probably

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.750 
this for a couple days so I probably
shouldn't<00:07:39.890> be<00:07:40.010> including<00:07:40.460> this<00:07:40.550> in<00:07:40.700> a

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760 
shouldn't be including this in a

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.030 
shouldn't be including this in a
favorites<00:07:41.120> video<00:07:41.210> yet<00:07:41.630> but<00:07:41.990> it<00:07:42.470> hasn't<00:07:42.830> broken

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.040 
favorites video yet but it hasn't broken

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.460 
favorites video yet but it hasn't broken
me<00:07:43.280> out<00:07:43.490> so<00:07:43.850> that's<00:07:44.270> the<00:07:44.690> good<00:07:44.720> thing<00:07:44.900> I<00:07:45.320> mean

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.470 
me out so that's the good thing I mean

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.630 
me out so that's the good thing I mean
that<00:07:45.650> I<00:07:45.680> still<00:07:45.919> probably<00:07:46.100> have<00:07:46.220> to<00:07:46.370> use<00:07:46.490> it<00:07:46.580> a

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:46.640 
that I still probably have to use it a

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.280 
that I still probably have to use it a
bit<00:07:46.790> longer<00:07:46.970> to<00:07:47.240> be<00:07:47.330> able<00:07:47.390> to<00:07:47.510> give<00:07:47.630> a<00:07:47.840> full
