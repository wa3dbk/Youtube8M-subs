00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:04.740 

and<00:00:03.639> I<00:00:03.730> think<00:00:03.940> when<00:00:04.090> we<00:00:04.120> were<00:00:04.359> kids<00:00:04.569> we<00:00:04.720> always

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
and I think when we were kids we always

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.320 
and I think when we were kids we always
dreamed<00:00:05.050> about<00:00:05.200> being<00:00:05.380> in<00:00:05.710> an<00:00:05.800> arenas<00:00:06.189> and<00:00:06.399> so

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
dreamed about being in an arenas and so

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.980 
dreamed about being in an arenas and so
we<00:00:07.839> wanted<00:00:08.200> to<00:00:08.490> somehow<00:00:09.490> that<00:00:10.360> the<00:00:10.570> ideas<00:00:10.959> that

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
we wanted to somehow that the ideas that

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.330 
we wanted to somehow that the ideas that
we<00:00:11.260> were<00:00:11.410> had<00:00:11.590> when<00:00:11.800> we<00:00:11.830> were<00:00:11.950> writing<00:00:12.040> songs

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
we were had when we were writing songs

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.759 
we were had when we were writing songs
was<00:00:12.490> one<00:00:12.610> of<00:00:12.730> them<00:00:12.820> to<00:00:12.969> come<00:00:13.120> across

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
was one of them to come across

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.959 
was one of them to come across
universally<00:00:14.769> and<00:00:14.889> um<00:00:15.099> but<00:00:15.519> I<00:00:15.549> think<00:00:15.610> this

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
got a and I think for a while so that's

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.710 
got a and I think for a while so that's
something<00:02:48.640> we<00:02:48.790> struggled<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.569> this

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
something we struggled with in and this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.289 
something we struggled with in and this
I<00:02:49.989> think<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.519> got<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.850> just<00:02:52.000> try<00:02:52.239> to

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
I think just you got to just try to

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.660 
I think just you got to just try to
harness<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.380> whatever<00:02:54.069> energy<00:02:54.519> you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
harness that that whatever energy you

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.490 
harness that that whatever energy you
have<00:02:54.850> at<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.060> time<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.510> song<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:56.019> like<00:02:56.350> we

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
have at the time this song is like we

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.949 
have at the time this song is like we
said<00:02:56.680> this<00:02:57.130> was<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.940> most<00:02:58.180> rebellious<00:02:58.600> thing

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
said this was the most rebellious thing

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.050 
said this was the most rebellious thing
we<00:02:59.110> could<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.530> our<00:02:59.650> career<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.190> it's<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
we could do in our career and it's the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.030 
we could do in our career and it's the
most<00:03:01.269> slick<00:03:01.660> record<00:03:02.110> we've<00:03:02.260> ever<00:03:02.440> made<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040
