and you can pull up the calculator with

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
and you can pull up the calculator with
a<00:01:17.640> clock<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.180> YouTube<00:01:18.540> app<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.960> let's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a clock or your YouTube app so let's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
a clock or your YouTube app so let's
pull<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> calculator<00:01:20.119> it'll<00:01:21.119> appear

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
pull out the calculator it'll appear

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.140 
pull out the calculator it'll appear
where<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.840> wanted<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.939> move<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
where you wanted it you can move it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
where you wanted it you can move it
around<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> quick<00:01:26.220> son

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
around like that you can do a quick son

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.569 
around like that you can do a quick son
and<00:01:27.259> get<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> result<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> want

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and get the result and then if you want

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
and get the result and then if you want
you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.850> minimize<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:31.770> minimized

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you can minimize that and your minimized

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.469 
you can minimize that and your minimized
app<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.640> floating<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.329> anytime

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
app is just floating there and anytime

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.600 
app is just floating there and anytime
you<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.110> open<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:34.890> another<00:01:35.070> app<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.430> stays

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you want to open up another app it stays

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
you want to open up another app it stays
on<00:01:35.729> top<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.390> still<00:01:36.780> go<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.530> find<00:01:37.710> any

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
on top so you can still go and find any

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230
