 study to make this makeup 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.800
 inspired by charlize network carpets 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.720
 theron I'll start by placing this 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.480
 first of the crayon land brand that is going 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.000
 to give a hydration bus since diane 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.739
 the skin is very dry I will put 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 all the products that I will use 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the video in the description box 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.360
 okay 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.640
 this is a first month is the benefits 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.400
 theron strike and this goes around the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.350
 Eyelid from the base of the eyelashes 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.840
 to the bone of the sixth 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.879
 then I will place a shadow on cream 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.510
 called bear star and is from the brand mack 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.129
 he is a painter and it is a champagne color 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 Precious is long lasting but this 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.589
 it will serve us as a base ok 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.989
 see how beautiful as it illuminates precious 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.969
 the eyes of diane the really very cute 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.950
 that shadow of the sea then I have this 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.530
 pallet of the natura brand that come with 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.500
 these three very cute metallic colors 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.930
 and I'm going to take the gold with a brush 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.110
 a little bit flabby and I'm going to put it 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.270
 only in the middle of the eyelid I'm going to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.789
 leave the tear remaining in the color 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.429
 champagne and in the center I'm going to place 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.920
 this golden color is a color watch 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.050
 very soft as you can see so that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.420
 I do not paint much I do not want them very golden 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.119
 then the dark color I'm putting 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.000
 in the left end and in the concave 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.640
 of the eye let's slowly darken the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 ends and we are putting the product in 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.430
 the concave 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.850
 then with a clean brush to 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.740
 blur let's blur the edges 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.150
 so that the edges do not remain very 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.940
 marked let's leave it well blurred 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.120
 now I'm going to take a matte shadow this 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.340
 It is black crayon totally black and 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.620
 a beveled broach that is like 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 eyebrows and let's do an outline 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.950
 kitten but very discreet very pegadito to 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.100
 the eyelashes look well -have 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.660
 but then we 're going to start it 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.540
 blending with the same brush let's go 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.990
 blurring the product I love doing 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.730
 this kind of defined with shadow 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.700
 basically because at the time it opens the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.920
 eye looks very natural is not a delineated 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.140
 look like with liquid dominator that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.180
 is extremely notorious but that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.730
 just give him a gel adif or towards 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 the sides but without it being so 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 eye-catching see how beautiful it looks 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.030
 now with the same golden shadow and this 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.940
 precision broach let's delineate 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.519
 the lower part of the eyes we want 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.160
 the bottom very golden that that 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.040
 it's going to give a beautiful shine then I'm going to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.519
 make tabs and put on mask 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.519
 tabs 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.500
 now I'm going to place two tabs 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.040
 These are the andrea 21 and these 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.260
 are the andrea 301 some are complete and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.650
 the others are just the little corners and see 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.870
 how nice it really is the man 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.620
 very beautiful eye and are not so exaggerated 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.230
 I love combining these two let's start 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.450
 third precious 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.050
 then as a base use perfection 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.750
 chandelier luminaire in color 40 la 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.610
 I put on the whole face and diane the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.860
 skin is a little dry so 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.910
 I decided not to put powders but 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.960
 simply from the base without dust ok 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.180
 use the same base in color 20 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.920
 to erase diane dark circles the no 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.020
 use a concealer of dark circles this is 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.830
 the same base only with one more color 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.680
 clear and then blur it in the eyebrows 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.650
 from a good comb and with a 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.410
 little bit of brown shadow I started 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.510
 mark only in the tail has the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.940
 He has the perfect eyebrows but neither 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.730
 I want them to be the focus not so the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.560
 we are matching then I have this 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.130
 brown on this subject that is the mineral 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.220
 life 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.940
 finally it is natural of mch the color is 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.940

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.490

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.770
 gastÃ³n pain of ships only that this is 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.480
 less pigmented but that's why 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.940
