00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.220
 true 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.670
 cut them in the wires now let's 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.280
 to do that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.670
 well now let's join this and then 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.180
 with the pliers we are going to cut cable 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.180
 by cable 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.260
 sink it 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.390
 attach the tab 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:11.170
 the stereo not that we're going to put good anymore 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.600
 connect I speak the speaker not the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.069
 cut and the united now what would be missing 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.150

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.939
 the yellow with him 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.350
 with the positive they go together more like there 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.260
 I have a cable 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.560
 and good and this is the blue would be the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.270
 control that this goes to the power that 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.370
 makes you pledge the power of the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.370
 power but 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.820
 Negative good, everything is ready 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.450
 in everything connected this is the control that 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.209
 He said 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.930
 that later I'm going to put a power 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.930
 now like this 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 as you can see he tended 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.460
 will come 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.379
 Sorry for the prolixity, but because 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.379
 I am alone and good I have things a hand 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.330
 there 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.330
 and 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
 and 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.340
 I will not put many songs but 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.500
 because copyright dictates it to me if not 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.210
 I'm going to put pieces to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.210
 so they see that it works 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.340
 I'm going to ask in good mind and this 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:23.169
 I'm going to put here 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.169
 and will put a cap or an object
