host Kristen we are going to do a loose
bind<00:00:20.490> off<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.240> can<00:00:21.449> do<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> flat<00:00:22.170> method<00:00:22.980> type

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
bind off you can do a flat method type

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.550 
bind off you can do a flat method type
but<00:00:24.269> we're<00:00:24.420> gonna<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> loose<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.170> which<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but we're gonna do a loose one which is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
but we're gonna do a loose one which is
gonna<00:00:25.769> match<00:00:26.490> more<00:00:26.939> closely<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.689> original

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
gonna match more closely the original

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
gonna match more closely the original
cast<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.740> loose<00:00:28.980> edge<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> think<00:00:30.330> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
cast on loose edge I like to think of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
cast on loose edge I like to think of
this<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> slipknot<00:00:31.590> method<00:00:32.009> we're<00:00:32.130> going

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
this as the slipknot method we're going

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.190 
this as the slipknot method we're going
to<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:32.700> working<00:00:32.969> strand<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.750> put<00:00:34.079> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
to take our working strand and put it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.840 
to take our working strand and put it
through<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.829> middle<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.370> we're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
through the middle and we're going to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.990 
through the middle and we're going to
wrap<00:00:38.870> lift<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> bottom<00:00:40.440> loop<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.040> pull<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
wrap lift the bottom loop and pull the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
wrap lift the bottom loop and pull the
top<00:00:42.270> through<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> bottom<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.739> make<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> new

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
top through the bottom to make a new

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209 
top through the bottom to make a new
loop<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> working<00:00:45.149> strand<00:00:46.039> use<00:00:47.039> your

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
loop from the working strand use your

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.000 
loop from the working strand use your
left<00:00:47.489> hand<00:00:48.230> or<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> coming<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
left hand or if you're coming from the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.160 
left hand or if you're coming from the
other<00:00:50.129> direction<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:52.110> can

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
other direction use your right you can

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.860 
other direction use your right you can
do<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.649> either<00:00:52.800> direction<00:00:53.329> pull<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
do this in either direction pull the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.979 
do this in either direction pull the
working<00:00:55.170> strand<00:00:55.649> through<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.309> loop<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
working strand through your loop and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.330 
working strand through your loop and
then<00:00:57.989> pull<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:59.480> little<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.690> tight<00:01:01.340> just

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
then pull it a little bit tight just

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.359 
then pull it a little bit tight just
snug<00:01:02.460> against<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> peg<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.220> you've

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
snug against the peg here and so you've

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.460 
snug against the peg here and so you've
got<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.549> new<00:01:05.790> loop<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.320> use

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
got a new loop now we're going to use

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
got a new loop now we're going to use
our<00:01:08.159> new<00:01:08.549> I'm<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> call<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.330> the

our new I'm going to call this the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
our new I'm going to call this the
working<00:01:09.930> loop<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.439> place<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.580> over<00:01:11.700> top<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
working loop and place it over top of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.160 
working loop and place it over top of
the<00:01:12.479> next<00:01:12.950> peg<00:01:14.150> that<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.990> one's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the next peg that you have so this one's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.090 
the next peg that you have so this one's
going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.409> number<00:01:16.650> two

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
going to be number two

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.740 
going to be number two
and<00:01:17.549> we're<00:01:17.759> gonna<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> same<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.570> we're

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and we're gonna do the same thing we're

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.590 
and we're gonna do the same thing we're
going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.950> our<00:01:20.100> tool<00:01:20.640> underneath<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
going to go put our tool underneath the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
going to go put our tool underneath the
loop<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> peg<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.400> which<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.759> your

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
loop on the peg here which is your

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.749 
loop on the peg here which is your
stitch<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.350> pull<00:01:25.380> through<00:01:26.100> down

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
stitch and then pull through down

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.140 
stitch and then pull through down
towards<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> bottom<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:28.590> new<00:01:29.280> loop<00:01:29.700> from

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
towards the bottom this new loop from

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.109 
towards the bottom this new loop from
the<00:01:30.270> working<00:01:30.619> yarn<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> same

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the working yarn and then do the same

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.649 
the working yarn and then do the same
thing<00:01:33.180> grab<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:34.710> working<00:01:34.890> strand<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> pull

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
thing grab your working strand and pull

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.200 
thing grab your working strand and pull
it<00:01:36.840> through<00:01:38.930> making<00:01:39.930> sure<00:01:40.700> it's<00:01:41.700> tight<00:01:42.000> now

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it through making sure it's tight now

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.899 
it through making sure it's tight now
this<00:01:42.570> loop<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.619> large<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.610> kind<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
this loop will get large so just kind of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.170 
this loop will get large so just kind of
pull<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> until<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.079> gets<00:01:46.380> small<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.180> then

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
pull on it until it gets small and then

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.830 
pull on it until it gets small and then
do<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> same<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.630> take<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.320> working<00:01:49.590> loop

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
do the same thing take your working loop

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
do the same thing take your working loop
pull<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.869> through<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.290> bottom<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.890> third

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pull it through the bottom of your third

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.639 
pull it through the bottom of your third
stitch<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.729> go<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:58.020> forget<00:01:58.320> to
