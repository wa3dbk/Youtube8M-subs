00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 We are in the planting phase. The phase is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.590
 a phase before the final part, however, 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 apart from drainage 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.770
 the connection and now made the participant 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.760
 friday and the planting is ending 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.760
 singing 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.510
 then after planting work begins 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.360
 of a very heavy agronomy team 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.240
 sweet air combat 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.520
 the same technical monitoring 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.180
 and that arena she closed marina there 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.340
 takes a very large shaded area 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.840
 there have lighting equipment 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.840
 artificial and supplies the need 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 we have the lawn example and a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 sensor it ow the amount of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 nutrients inside the soil 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.720
 soil moisture and by talking about 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.580
 balancing people know that people 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.619
 apply the name of the lawn 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.930
 about it the palm trees not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.930
 worried the ball will roll round 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.020
 the technological package that will detect it 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.030
 It's 90% scaled and everything will be 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.650
 ready and running until the end of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.360
 month in the next 15 days today is the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.120
 The second day I was on the ground test. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 and making final sound adjustments 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.830
 the big screen attacks the years already makes already 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.869
 a month already the first by gtalk ready 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.060
 working as it is ready 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.150
 for this next step in the next 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.700
 week is so speaking ai faifi too 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.090
 500 antennas are scattered throughout 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 the 500 200 antennas arena is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.009
 on our rooftop here to allow 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.810
 all users is also 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.759
 lower and upper will be 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.070
 necessarily an initial 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.590
 people can make contacts 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.130
 it is ours our client understand the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 funk and attend the parties either in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.540
 days of shows on football days 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.510
 the idea is that the sound screen and wifi 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.280
 through a mep application that we 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.250
 we are already developing is in phase 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.860
 intermediary development is the three 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 if they speak to the point of view something with which 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.210
 the interaction between the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.180
 locution 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.400
 making an encore curries in the arena 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.240
 staff in the EP and can vote the best 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.640
 player 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.120
 or maybe choosing the song made the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.450
 last song to the encore of the artist 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.240
 the set is more iff for all 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.640
 but the screen more of the sound makes a 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.640
 experience in quite distinct
