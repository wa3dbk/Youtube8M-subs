00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.889
 staff this video I'll address 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.809
 show you in an intuitive way 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.700
 because it is not possible to divide a number 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.470
 by saw 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.980
 initially I will put four here 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.789
 for example / a number that is not zero 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.619
 hour 4/2 to 2 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.730
 there is no problem when the number of 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:38.630
 down is not zero, no problem 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.030
 can even above 60/20/2 if I 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.160
 I have 10 oranges to divide between 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.870
 two people each will stay with 10 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 when the number of casualties is different from 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.210
 zero no problem 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 then the top one being 10 not being 10 a 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.140
 division is normal 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.580
 I wanted to talk to you too 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.719
 any number 1 x 0 01 saving this 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.590
 10 times three 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:14.630
 this dot means times 10 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.140
 four also to 00 times one maybe 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.249
 this way it can also less 3.5 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.560
 will also give zero any number 1 x 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:28.579
 0 reserve 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.749
 we have already seen two things underneath being 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.490
 zero has no normal vision problem 

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:37.039
 now let's see when the number down 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.719
 starts to give problem 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:45.079
 3/0 there is already a problem 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:49.249
 three videos per 0 I'm going to teach for 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.909
 you so in a rational and 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:56.090
 an intuitive informational form 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.659
 share three with me and three oranges with 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 nobody like you will d3 oranges with 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.109
 No one could tell her how to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.609
 me but if you have split and stay 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.410
 with them you are driving with a 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.980
 person I want to know if you leave the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.450
 room to share 3 valencia with anyone 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.129
 it's impossible 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.700
 the element with no one nobody will stay 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.890
 with a good is this is the rational way of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.390
 23 with nobody is impossible but I go 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:38.459
 do by the way the gfco that 3/0 call 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:41.340
 of kk is ok 10 is a number will pass 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.000
 on the other hand multiplying at the time 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.730
 three equal to zero 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.630
 since then the question is what is the number 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 that x 0 of the belief 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.700
 we already saw here any number 1 x 0 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.430
 to 0 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.799
 there is no number that x 0 of 31 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.250
 any number 1 x 0 to 0 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.440
 so this is not impossible here 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.150
 an impossible situation to happen 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.859
 so here it is also impossible 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:25.010
 divide a number other than zero to 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:32.220
 zero is impossible to attack on a people 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:41.160
 if I can not do it now 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:48.299
 let's say that the number 100 that changes the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:50.100
 number of 100 what can happen let's 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.970
 make the shape to jeb I 'll be more 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.290
 on here 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:01.139
 01/0 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:09.269
 dk before finding the value I will 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:17.160
 invent situations 0/0 is one thing / 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:20.039
 she 10/0 I'm going to say it's 00/0 I 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.930
 I'll say it's minus 11 regulators 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:29.190
 three situations 10 dividing pass to 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:35.020
 there being a lot getting 10 equals 1 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.900
 011 000 empty goal can only be 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.420
 one is a possibility 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.740
 another 10 to speak multiply zoe is 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.230
 equal to zero times 0000 equal to zero 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.550
 staff did not contradict be 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.890
 equal to zero also a possibility 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:59.970
 Go there multiplying zero is equal 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:03.340
 less than 1,200 equals zero or less 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.740
 1,2 that has nothing to do is a number 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.210
 totally strange is also a 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.730
 possibility 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:19.780
 so coming back up here 00 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:26.160
 I'll pass the 0x0 is equal to 0 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:28.330
 what is the number that x 0 to 0 either 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.840
 infinite numbers that I can put 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.570
 here x 0 losing equality will close 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.270
 so this here in allows a 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.200
 infinity of innumerable assumes the value of 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.010
 here 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:52.230
 then it is an indeterminate situation and a 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:55.960
 determined to have nothing 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.590
 So when you have zero and no misery in 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.840
 low a quote in certain 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:07.360
 has zero down on non-zero 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.330
 above is impossible when below 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.450
 and it's normal vision , no problem 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.640
 there is no personal when the zero in 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.230
 down we have to also look at who 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:24.130
 is above 60 arise in determining the 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.810
 Up and different is impossible, is not it? 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.530
 not even there 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.530
 I hope you have helped
