00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.700
 how difficult it is to go through a change 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.699
 neurologically we resist 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.830
 accept the changes changes that today in 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.740
 the normal life of the days that 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.620
 they are more and more frequent 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.200
 but also increasingly broad 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.450
 change and increasing resistance 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.490
 part of our brain to admit those 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.750
 changes adapt to these changes by 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.680
 that is that the idea 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 to work this to move from the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.809
 resistance to change to neuro leading the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.880
 change is a major challenge but 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.770
 because we resist the change in 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.970
 actually there is a very neurological reason 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.310
 simple 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.710
 all change implies putting the 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.540
 working memory justly or the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.790
 short - term memory as there 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.610
 call 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.680
 but somehow working that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.760
 memory putting that memory into active 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 it implies greater mental energy consumption 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.140
 higher energy consumption in the brain 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.440
 for that activation of the memory of 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.780
 I work instead where there is no 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.080
 circumstances of change where we are 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.050
 in a regular normal life 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.840
 actually those who work in the greatest 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.480
 part of the decisions are the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 called the basal ganglia 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.909
 basal ganglia do not require as much 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 Energy 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.159
 and that is then the cause a matter 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.830
 of energy savings that naturally the 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.680
 brain 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.550
 imposes on its operation 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.360
 and to be able to generate these changes is 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.690
 Necessary to act just neuro 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.820
 leading that process the methodology 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.650
 to overcome that resistance to change 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.930
 it has to do with a discovery that 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.230
 has been done recently 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.750
 it has been discovered that a brain in 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.300
 Circumstances of uncertainty 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.700
 does not get filtered many of the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.470
 external stipulations that it receives in 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.480
 reality is how I know how it is 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.540
 button it like it locks itself 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 himself and makes decisions based on his 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.650
 circumstance prior to your 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.940
 circumstance already memorized not 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.170
 admitting external stipulations 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's like that out of fear avoids that uncertain 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 external circumstance that's why it's 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.390
 that the first attitude that you have to take 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.160
 with this to overcome the resistance to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.590
 change particularly in environments 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.350
 organizational environments that today by 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.030
 reasons for the difficult circumstance of 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.360
 the economy and the instabilities 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.599
 businesswomen is important 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.840
 recognize that it is necessary to reassure 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.819
 the uncertainties soften the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.580
 uncertainties reduce the salt of 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.250
 certainties in the sense that 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.500
 people have as clear what 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.450
 happens even more in the face of circumstances 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.120
 difficult and in the face of the diffusion of maybe 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.970
 comments in an organization where 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.310
 will dispense with such or such or such 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.340
 percent of employees 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.710
 probably keep that uncertainty 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.540
 is to affect all those who 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.450
 are probably involved in that 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.390
 10% and those that do not while the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.510
 attitude is taken quickly maybe 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.960
 favoring with attention processes to 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.960
 who are affected 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.180
 or even with processes of 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.690
 broader explanation in those who do 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.030
 they last but in any case the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.800
 uncertainty are overcome is active I 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.780
 it is clear although not ideal so 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.440
 dear but it is clear in the sense 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.180
 that decisions towards futures already 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.300
 they will not have changes at least not so much 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.130
 change then the recommendation for 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.150
 work on the subject of resistance 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.550
 of the change try to avoid avoiding 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.440
 clearly these uncertainties 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.350
 that the change would take us because the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.200
 problem of resistance to change not 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.990
 it is resistance to change itself but it is 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.240
 the effect that uncertainty produces 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.730
 where the change is going and this is the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 reality that must be resolved in the 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.260
 circumstances that are being lived 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.260
 lately
