00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
practical effects for other things that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.690 
practical effects for other things that
I<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.239> with<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.069> things

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
when I get them open up the moment I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.809 
when I get them open up the moment I
open<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:18.980> up<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.250> thought<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.489> myself<00:02:19.580> you

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
open this up I thought to myself you

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.610 
open this up I thought to myself you
know<00:02:19.910> what<00:02:20.000> if<00:02:20.210> I<00:02:20.300> was<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.540> take<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.990> top<00:02:21.410> or

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
know what if I was to take the top or

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.550 
know what if I was to take the top or
out<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:23.390> simply<00:02:23.900> put<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> container

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
out and just simply put the container

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.630 
out and just simply put the container
together<00:02:24.980> as<00:02:25.160> is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
together as is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
which I initially when I was looking at

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.360 
which I initially when I was looking at
the<00:03:45.350> package<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.769> thought<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.010> myself<00:03:46.130> there

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
the package I thought to myself there

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.949 
the package I thought to myself there
was<00:03:46.459> no<00:03:46.579> way<00:03:46.790> that's<00:03:47.060> gonna<00:03:47.150> fit<00:03:47.420> on<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.600> pencil

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
was no way that's gonna fit on a pencil

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.130 
was no way that's gonna fit on a pencil
that's<00:03:48.290> way<00:03:48.560> too<00:03:48.620> small<00:03:49.480> spot<00:03:50.480> wasn't<00:03:50.720> using

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
that's way too small spot wasn't using

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.449 
that's way too small spot wasn't using
his<00:03:51.170> imagination<00:03:51.680> then<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> didn't

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
his imagination then because I didn't
