make<00:00:46.379> much<00:00:46.590> sense<00:00:47.719> well<00:00:48.719> anyway<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
make much sense well anyway I have to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
make much sense well anyway I have to
say<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.329> show<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:51.660> rather<00:00:51.840> interesting

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
say the show was rather interesting

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
say the show was rather interesting
because<00:00:52.559> each<00:00:52.829> village<00:00:53.340> has<00:00:54.300> their<00:00:54.510> own

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
because each village has their own

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
because each village has their own
ninjas<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.460> their<00:00:56.579> own<00:00:56.610> symbol<00:00:57.149> on

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
ninjas and they have their own symbol on

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.319 
ninjas and they have their own symbol on
their<00:00:57.420> own<00:00:57.539> forehead<00:00:57.840> protectors<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.329> eat

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
their own forehead protectors so I eat

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
their own forehead protectors so I eat
so<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> makes<00:01:01.140> their<00:01:01.379> develop<00:01:01.829> them

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so it makes their develop them

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100
