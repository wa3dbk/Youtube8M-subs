00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
can see it's the same now we try out the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.809 
can see it's the same now we try out the
bow<00:03:00.920> let's<00:03:01.920> go<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.489> can<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.700> the

bow let's go see as you can see the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.960 
bow let's go see as you can see the
arrow<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.630> working<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.730> doesn't

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
arrow it's not working so it doesn't

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.050 
arrow it's not working so it doesn't
really<00:03:06.060> matter<00:03:06.500> one<00:03:08.209> two<00:03:09.209> three<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.910> that's

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
really matter one two three so that's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.320 
really matter one two three so that's
the<00:03:12.180> same<00:03:12.720> as<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.260> bow<00:03:13.440> now<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.519> three<00:03:14.940> hits<00:03:15.150> a

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
the same as a bow now it's three hits a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.390 
the same as a bow now it's three hits a
stone<00:03:15.900> sword<00:03:16.050> will<00:03:16.290> do<00:03:16.380> four<00:03:16.650> hits<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.069> an

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
stone sword will do four hits and an

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.770 
stone sword will do four hits and an
iron<00:03:17.579> sword<00:03:17.790> will<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.090> three<00:03:18.299> hits<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.630> it's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
iron sword will do three hits so it's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.930 
iron sword will do three hits so it's
pretty<00:03:18.930> much<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> same<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.470> iron<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.280> guess

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
pretty much the same as iron but I guess

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.410 
pretty much the same as iron but I guess
it<00:03:21.150> does<00:03:21.299> less<00:03:21.510> hard<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:21.989> still<00:03:22.230> kills<00:03:22.470> them

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
it does less hard but still kills them

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.660 
it does less hard but still kills them
