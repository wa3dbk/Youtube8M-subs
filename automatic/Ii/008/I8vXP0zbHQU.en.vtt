00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740 

my<00:01:06.880> gas<00:01:07.180> is<00:01:07.510> no<00:01:07.720> good<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:10.150> right<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.420> tried<00:01:10.570> to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
my gas is no good all right we tried to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.180 
my gas is no good all right we tried to
crank<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.170> wouldn't<00:01:11.650> fire

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
crank it wouldn't fire

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.560 
crank it wouldn't fire
I<00:01:12.630> pulled<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> coil<00:01:13.990> wire<00:01:14.230> off<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:16.270> was

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
I pulled the coil wire off and there was

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.740 
I pulled the coil wire off and there was
zero<00:01:16.960> voltage<00:01:17.640> which<00:01:18.640> makes<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.120> hard<00:01:19.300> for<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
zero voltage which makes it hard for the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.920 
zero voltage which makes it hard for the
distributor<00:01:20.560> make<00:01:20.800> spark<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.600> little

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
distributor make spark so a little

investigating<00:01:24.690> with<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.720> meter<00:01:26.020> at<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.350> fuse

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
investigating with a meter at the fuse

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.960 
investigating with a meter at the fuse
box<00:01:28.380> figured<00:01:29.380> out<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:30.190> didn't<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.580> any<00:01:30.730> power

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
box figured out it didn't have any power

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.970 
box figured out it didn't have any power
at<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.390> coil<00:01:31.630> wire<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:34.170> trace<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.410> back<00:01:35.440> and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
at the coil wire so trace that back and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.220 
at the coil wire so trace that back and
I<00:01:36.010> had<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> wire<00:01:36.760> on<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.090> wrong<00:01:37.270> post<00:01:37.660> on<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
I had the wire on the wrong post on the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.220 
I had the wire on the wrong post on the
ignition<00:01:38.440> switch<00:01:38.800> now<00:01:39.370> we<00:01:39.430> got<00:01:39.700> voltage<00:01:40.230> I'm

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
is it or isn't it

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:04.270 
is it or isn't it
you<00:04:54.809> put<00:04:55.020> off<00:04:55.229> again

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:13.719 

sounds<00:05:05.280> pretty<00:05:05.460> healthy

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.440 

you

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.050 

Hey<00:05:20.440> hit<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.740> gas<00:05:20.890> one<00:05:21.250> time<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:21.790> mommy

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.010 

there<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.720> go

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
there you go

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.920 
there you go
there<00:05:26.530> you<00:05:26.590> go

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
there you go

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:36.220 
there you go
hit<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.650> again

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.130 

there<00:05:37.230> you<00:05:37.350> go<00:05:37.880> well<00:05:38.880> she's<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.240> little<00:05:39.510> smoky

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
there you go well she's a little smoky

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.050 
there you go well she's a little smoky
in<00:05:40.170> there

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
in there

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.900 
in there
hopefully<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:42.960> smoke<00:05:43.350> clears<00:05:43.710> up<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:44.190> think

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.850 

but<00:05:48.480> she's<00:05:48.660> warming<00:05:49.050> up<00:05:49.200> temperature<00:05:49.650> gauges

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
but she's warming up temperature gauges

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.610 
but she's warming up temperature gauges
showing<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.400> little<00:05:50.580> bit

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.050 

thermostats<00:05:57.620> open<00:05:58.389> up<00:05:59.389> a<00:05:59.539> radiator<00:06:00.020> tie

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.910 

I<00:06:03.090> was<00:06:03.390> looking<00:06:03.720> at<00:06:03.840> first<00:06:04.110> in<00:06:04.350> there<00:06:04.560> looking

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
I was looking at first in there looking

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.740 
I was looking at first in there looking
for<00:06:05.100> circulation<00:06:05.670> but<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.120> guess<00:06:06.330> all<00:06:06.570> the

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
for circulation but I guess all the

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.100 
for circulation but I guess all the
water<00:06:06.960> is<00:06:07.110> going<00:06:07.290> straight<00:06:07.710> down

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.040 

the<00:06:10.350> boards<00:06:10.680> are<00:06:10.800> oriented

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
the boards are oriented

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.629 
the boards are oriented
tuflow<00:06:14.050> radiator

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.129 

that<00:06:18.999> little<00:06:19.240> lifters<00:06:19.629> pink<00:06:19.930> went<00:06:20.199> away

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.770 

temperature<00:06:24.919> gauge<00:06:25.099> is<00:06:25.310> working<00:06:25.759> and<00:06:26.419> later

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
temperature gauge is working and later

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.309 
temperature gauge is working and later
evidently<00:06:27.530> I<00:06:27.620> got<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:28.039> hooked<00:06:28.250> up<00:06:28.460> backwards

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
evidently I got that hooked up backwards

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:33.100 
evidently I got that hooked up backwards
oil<00:06:30.319> pressure<00:06:30.620> gauge<00:06:30.770> is<00:06:31.159> working<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:32.900> gas

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
oil pressure gauge is working the gas

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.500 
oil pressure gauge is working the gas
gauge<00:06:33.379> is<00:06:33.620> working

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
gauge is working

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.970 
gauge is working
but<00:06:36.510> what<00:06:36.690> ain't<00:06:36.960> working<00:06:37.790> is<00:06:38.790> my<00:06:38.820> switch<00:06:39.980> it

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
but what ain't working is my switch it

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.420 
but what ain't working is my switch it
just<00:06:41.250> stumbles<00:06:41.820> when<00:06:42.000> you<00:06:42.120> turn<00:06:42.300> it<00:06:42.450> off

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
just stumbles when you turn it off

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.000 
just stumbles when you turn it off
guess<00:06:44.910> I'll<00:06:45.120> figure<00:06:45.360> that<00:06:45.479> out<00:06:46.050> evidently<00:06:46.710> the

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
guess I'll figure that out evidently the

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.510 
guess I'll figure that out evidently the
missus<00:06:47.370> wants<00:06:47.610> to<00:06:47.820> drive<00:06:48.090> it<00:06:49.190> she's<00:06:50.190> cleaning

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
missus wants to drive it she's cleaning

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.490 
missus wants to drive it she's cleaning
out<00:06:50.699> the<00:06:50.850> back<00:06:51.030> of<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.240> truck<00:06:51.510> I<00:06:54.380> figured<00:06:55.380> out

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
out the back of the truck I figured out

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.320 
out the back of the truck I figured out
the<00:06:55.590> source<00:06:55.830> of<00:06:55.979> my<00:06:56.100> problem<00:06:56.280> why<00:06:56.940> she<00:06:57.180> won't

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
the source of my problem why she won't

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.770 
the source of my problem why she won't
shut<00:06:57.600> off<00:06:57.780> I<00:06:58.050> believe<00:06:59.150> sometimes<00:07:00.150> you<00:07:00.510> got<00:07:00.660> to

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
shut off I believe sometimes you got to

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.129 
shut off I believe sometimes you got to
put<00:07:00.960> a<00:07:00.990> resistor<00:07:02.150> on<00:07:03.150> that<00:07:03.389> wire<00:07:03.690> right<00:07:04.080> there

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
put a resistor on that wire right there

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.219 
put a resistor on that wire right there
I<00:07:04.710> think<00:07:05.100> that's<00:07:05.550> the<00:07:05.760> deal<00:07:06.000> because<00:07:06.479> now<00:07:06.750> with

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
I think that's the deal because now with

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:16.670 
I think that's the deal because now with
the<00:07:07.350> alternator<00:07:07.979> unplugged<00:07:10.940> Sheila<00:07:15.680> fire

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
the alternator unplugged Sheila fire

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.710 
the alternator unplugged Sheila fire
right<00:07:16.949> up<00:07:17.360> and<00:07:18.360> shut<00:07:18.690> right<00:07:18.960> off<00:07:20.210> so<00:07:21.210> that's

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
right up and shut right off so that's

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.980 
right up and shut right off so that's

hey<00:07:25.699> what<00:07:26.699> are<00:07:26.729> you<00:07:26.820> doing<00:07:27.030> in<00:07:27.120> bed<00:07:27.150> already

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.409 

you

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.969 

all<00:07:38.419> right<00:07:38.689> we<00:07:39.019> tried<00:07:39.169> to<00:07:39.349> crank<00:07:39.619> her<00:07:39.769> she

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:39.979 
all right we tried to crank her she

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:47.349 
all right we tried to crank her she
wouldn't<00:07:40.219> fire<00:07:41.829> figure<00:07:42.829> it<00:07:42.889> out<00:07:43.039> be<00:07:44.349> well
