 this process will be able to do it also 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:23.520
 here in this video of how surrounded by 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.350
 that surrounded android of my channel 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.350
 a user put this question 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.719
 well the answer is very simple as 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.100
 see this I'm going to teach you now with a 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.469
 specific program that I'm going to 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.789
 show I'm going to leave the place for you 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:49.059
 download it is that folder sk of z 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.250
 as shown there and the firmware that 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.579
 you want to say that you want 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.530
 install is google stuff and for 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.809
 look for the if you want 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.299
 Go back to the official firmware of your 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.729
 mobile phone company you have to 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:08.399
 look for example in this case in this 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.399
 case that I have is this version 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.450
 already this version that is clear chile 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.210
 then if you want to search for 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.930
 example the study for example firmware 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.390
 of such a company or the one that you want 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.210
 install that is better than the original 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.880
 good company we have already downloaded a 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.770
 firmware you have to download this 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 folder that I'm going to leave the link in 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 the description of the video 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.030
 what they are going to do is 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.310
 connect your phone in mode 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.069
 emergency because what you do 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.539
 how is this really going if the 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.310
 phone was spoiled or not 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.920
 This mode also works 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.509
 flash eo is already fully reset 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.670
 of how your phone was delivered to you 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.380
 factory then what you have to 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.859
 to do is in this case I'm turning off 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.859
 my phone 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.490
 let's wait for it to turn off 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.770
 while I would like to thank 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.040
 all the subscribers of my channel in 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.040
 Youtube 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.519
 that are already 32 line in all those 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.510
 people or I find that it's a lot 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.980
 for five videos 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.680
 I will continue making progress with the channel 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.719
 subscribe give it like 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.329
 also here is this new video that 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.530
 you went up a bit that has very few 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.319
 reproductions that is an assistant of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.120
 voice close that I'm going to leave the video 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.569
 the description for you to see it is very 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.780
 interesting here is the rap file 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.360
 that they 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.510
 in mediafire is uploaded the link is not 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.510
 my own 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.050
 but then now since it's off 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.550
 the phone to start it in mode 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.060
 emergency what you are going to have 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.060
 what to do is the following 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.010
 that is, they are going to open this recipe first 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.390
 that I'm going to let you open now I was going to 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.940
 leave this and here what comes out here this 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.360
 CÃ¡diz is the first that they are going to open 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.440
 already and will do it and trade to this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.560
 here you leave that exactly like 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.210
 and here where jacques says they have to 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.510
 put the emergency already then now they go 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:27.640
 to take the usb cable in your phone what 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.640
 they will connect to the computer 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.670
 there tells us a lot I must be 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.940
 as the tip 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.780
 and the next thing they 're going to do is with the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.810
 point here from your plug and already connected 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.810
 to the computer they will take your phone 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.770
 he has his phone and they are going to keep 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.080
 tight the volume below and above 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.580
 and cram the keep tight they go to 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.580
 introduce the usb cable 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.459
 immediately the computer recognize 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.099
 this and it will leave something similar to 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.730
 this mode emergency all the screen 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.010
 yellow and so now they're going to proceed with 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.720
 this here in the program that had 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.150
 shown 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.830
 and you have to put the firmware that 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.770
 you downloaded that in this case I 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.640
 I have this one that is seen here and they are going to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.920
 put there in each silk files go to 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.380
 look for the file and in this case I would 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.460
 I have on the desk 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.460
 if you look for it 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.639
 Sorry, I'm taking the mouse 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.639
 with the left hand 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:54.180
 there is there one then you click and 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.180
 they put it open 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.000
 already there will show you the location of 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.550
 file and now simply what has 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.340
 what to do is put launch software 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.240
 update with one click will start to do 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.850
 all this process and they will happen to have 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.640
 newly installed this version of 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.680
 firmware on your phone or with you 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.600
 also when frank the phone what 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.420
 allows this is to restart the phone 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.280
 exactly how they came factory I say 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.940
 that the only thing he does is actually 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.840
 delete the recovery menu and the root that 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.370
 they give all installed applications 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.370
 but the best thing is to do a reset 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.979
 teacher so everything works well 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.660
 then now you are going to launch software 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.300
 update will start to release some 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.889
 things that I will not do because now 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.440
 was to teach it by this user that 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.720
 I put the question will start 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.169
 charge when you finish your phone is going 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.360
 to start there is going to restart as in 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.780
 actually going to start as the firmware 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.630
 new that they installed 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.000
 and will you learn and what are you going to 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.240
 do when you have already learned to 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.240
 disconnect this 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.310
 very good connect phones and battery 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.830
 one second 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.910
 then what you are going to do is 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.910
 when you are restarting they will wait for 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.110
 that is fully charged so that if 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.490
 we are fully going to give you the 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.860
 time for you to feel that you charge all 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.900
 the applications of all that at least 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.150
 since taking the best is to give them five 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.140
 minutes and then they will turn off their 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.130
 phone and once it's off for 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.680
 execute the master reset what 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.950
 have to do is to keep the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.290
 button to turn off the call and turn off the 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.800
 same time we press the button 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:57.430
 volume down or we squeeze these two 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.200
 buttons plus any of the below and it's going to be 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.889
 a master reset that erases all 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.499
 data from 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.030
 of the phone's internal memory is still 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:07.009
 leaving the ones on the card 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.240
 microsd which are the photos the image the 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:13.729
 contacts and various things 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.110
 when they have already done the prescribed teacher 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.930
 they will look like a screen that comes out 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.949
 I find an android with a little box and 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.810
 when this process is over he will 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:22.340
 restart your phone and they will have the 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.289
 phone exactly as it came from 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.229
 factory with your microsd card with all 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.490
 the data good if you for example 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:31.729
 they want to install as I told them 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.919
 firmware that is not version 10 in this 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:36.919
 case I downloaded it because I made this 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:39.240
 same process to return it to the place of 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:41.910
 factory 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.009
 and to download is something to juggle as 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.710
 I had told them to search in Google the 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.900
 firmware that you want and once 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.740
 searched with all the steps of 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.229
 this file that is the cade setup that 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.529
 he had already shown this folder that 

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:58.569
 you see there 

00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:01.769
 good friends that was all I hope you 

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:01.769
 have served a lot goodbye
