day and you're not going to end up
scoring<00:02:04.290> goals<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.189> plateau<00:02:05.880> gets<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> lucky

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it into the box and menace somehow

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.820

manages<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.690> defend<00:02:13.110> at<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.500> back

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
manages to to be is defend at the back

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
manages to to be is defend at the back
post<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.190> thought<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.300> for<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> one

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
post and thought that one in for a one

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
post and thought that one in for a one
all<00:02:16.110> at<00:02:16.410> half<00:02:16.710> time<00:02:16.770> which<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.520> pretty<00:02:17.940> decent

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
all at half time which is pretty decent

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.190 
all at half time which is pretty decent
so<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.350> go<00:02:19.620> into<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.100> break<00:02:20.570> even<00:02:21.570> stevens

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so we do go into that break even stevens

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.980 
so we do go into that break even stevens
now<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.040> stats<00:02:23.310> wise<00:02:23.580> i'm<00:02:24.240> getting<00:02:24.660> dominated

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
now the stats wise i'm getting dominated

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.640 
now the stats wise i'm getting dominated
I've<00:02:25.560> had<00:02:26.490> one<00:02:26.820> shot<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.360> target<00:02:27.630> way<00:02:28.410> less

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
I've had one shot on target way less

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.040 
I've had one shot on target way less
possession<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.970> clear<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.240> say<00:02:30.570> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
possession and it's clear to say that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.800 
possession and it's clear to say that
this<00:02:31.290> guy<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.590> slightly<00:02:32.190> better<00:02:32.610> than<00:02:33.150> me<00:02:33.570> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
this guy is slightly better than me and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.920 
this guy is slightly better than me and
so<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:35.370> we're<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.910> get<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> winner<00:02:36.360> it's

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
so if we're going to get a winner it's

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.480 
so if we're going to get a winner it's
going<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> very<00:02:37.320> very<00:02:37.770> lucky<00:02:38.040> one<00:02:38.370> we

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
going to be a very very lucky one we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.890 
going to be a very very lucky one we
play<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.730> Bruce<00:02:39.000> ebro<00:02:39.480> takes<00:02:39.750> that
