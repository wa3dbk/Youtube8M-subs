thoughts on homophobia in football

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.380 
thoughts on homophobia in football
unfortunately<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> think<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.090> still

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
unfortunately I think it is still

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.849 
unfortunately I think it is still
something<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> reality<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.560> teams

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
something that is a reality with teams

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.089 
something that is a reality with teams
and<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.400> issues<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:24.710> still<00:00:25.710> stemming

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and there are issues just still stemming

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.630 
and there are issues just still stemming
from<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.840> stubborn<00:00:27.840> job<00:00:28.800> mentality<00:00:29.400> that

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
from the stubborn job mentality that

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.130 
from the stubborn job mentality that
some<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> guys<00:00:30.240> still<00:00:30.449> hold<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> with

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
some of the guys still hold on to with

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
some of the guys still hold on to with
sports<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.949> definitely<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
sports but I definitely think that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
sports but I definitely think that
people<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.660> becoming<00:00:33.840> more<00:00:34.140> open<00:00:34.230> minded

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
people are becoming more open minded

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.760 
people are becoming more open minded
towards<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.579> player<00:00:35.880> did<00:00:36.149> come<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.390> um<00:00:36.809> do

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
towards it a player did come out um do

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.049 
towards it a player did come out um do
you<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:37.890> they<00:00:38.160> would<00:00:38.309> encounter<00:00:38.550> bullies

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you think they would encounter bullies

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.729 
you think they would encounter bullies
on<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.270> team<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> they

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
on the team or do you think that they

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
on the team or do you think that they
would<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> support<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> we

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
would have that support I know that we

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.330 
would have that support I know that we
have<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.809> welcoming<00:00:43.200> locker<00:00:43.440> room<00:00:43.710> I'm

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
have a very welcoming locker room I'm

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.709 
have a very welcoming locker room I'm
sure<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> guys<00:00:45.180> would<00:00:45.360> feel<00:00:45.570> off

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
sure some of the guys would feel off

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
sure some of the guys would feel off
about<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> at<00:00:46.170> first<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.100> everybody

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
about it at first but I think everybody

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.930 
about it at first but I think everybody
would<00:00:47.550> warm<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:49.940> statistically

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
would warm up to it statistically

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
would warm up to it statistically
speaking<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.539> gay<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.559> lesbian

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
speaking there are gay and lesbian

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
speaking there are gay and lesbian
athletes<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.809> they<00:00:54.809> probably<00:00:55.289> just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
athletes out there they probably just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.900 
athletes out there they probably just
don't<00:00:55.860> feel<00:00:55.980> comfortable<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> moment<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
don't feel comfortable at the moment to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750 
don't feel comfortable at the moment to
come<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.920> I'm<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.160> sure<00:00:59.219> exactly

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
come out about it I'm not sure exactly

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.810 
come out about it I'm not sure exactly
how<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> address<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.390> issue<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> think

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
how to address the issue but I think

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.979 
how to address the issue but I think
just<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.300> athletes<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> feel

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
just as more athletes do you feel

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.780 
just as more athletes do you feel
comfortable<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> locker<00:01:04.979> room<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> are

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
comfortable in the locker room and are

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.000 
comfortable in the locker room and are
willing<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> come<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> issue<00:01:07.010> then

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
willing to come out about the issue then

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830 
willing to come out about the issue then
I<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.430> people<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:08.970> younger<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I think people that are younger and the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
I think people that are younger and the
sports<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.320> start<00:01:10.740> feeling<00:01:10.979> comfortable

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
sports will start feeling comfortable

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.960 
sports will start feeling comfortable
admitting<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:13.580> off<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> top<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> my
