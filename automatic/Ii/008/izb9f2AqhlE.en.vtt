here<00:00:25.590> pretty<00:00:26.280> close<00:00:26.780> 55<00:00:27.780> 56<00:00:28.320> anyway<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.430> have

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
here pretty close 55 56 anyway we have

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.020 
here pretty close 55 56 anyway we have
that<00:00:29.850> and<00:00:30.480> i<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.699> southwestern<00:00:32.699> style

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that and i use this southwestern style

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
that and i use this southwestern style
egg<00:00:33.360> beaters<00:00:33.980> do<00:00:34.980> 80<00:00:36.290> servings<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.850> that's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
egg beaters do 80 servings so that's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.400 
egg beaters do 80 servings so that's
gonna<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.450> cetera<00:00:39.960> button<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.239> that's

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
gonna go for cetera button and that's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.970 
gonna go for cetera button and that's
378<00:00:43.410> grounds<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> we'll<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.260> pour<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.680> in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
378 grounds so we'll just pour that in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.910 
378 grounds so we'll just pour that in
there<00:00:47.010> until<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.239> gets<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> 378<00:00:54.920> we're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there until it gets to 378 we're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.600 
there until it gets to 378 we're
somewhere<00:00:56.309> close<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.940> doesn't<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.450> be<00:00:57.480> I

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
somewhere close it doesn't have to be I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.569 
somewhere close it doesn't have to be I
mean<00:00:59.610> we're<00:00:59.790> talking<00:00:59.940> grams<00:01:00.540> here's<00:01:01.579> 379

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
mean we're talking grams here's 379

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
mean we're talking grams here's 379
there<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.390> used<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.530> use<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
there we go I used to just use the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.359 
there we go I used to just use the
regular<00:01:04.949> egg<00:01:05.549> whites<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.270> fight<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.369> regular

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
regular egg whites or fight the regular

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.899 
regular egg whites or fight the regular
egg<00:01:08.880> beaters<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.530> has<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.009> I<00:01:11.520> don't

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
egg beaters but this has like I don't

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.699 
egg beaters but this has like I don't
know<00:01:12.030> tomatoes<00:01:12.600> onions<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.649> of

vegetables<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.459> that<00:01:14.609> I<00:01:14.670> used<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.999> cut

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
vegetables in there that I used to cut

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.330 
vegetables in there that I used to cut
up<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.659> put<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:15.990> myself<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.740> i<00:01:17.159> got

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
up and put in there myself but i got

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.190 
up and put in there myself but i got
lazy<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.149> a<00:01:18.270> whole<00:01:18.389> lot<00:01:18.539> faster<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.170> i

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
lazy and that's a whole lot faster so i

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.769 
lazy and that's a whole lot faster so i
started<00:01:19.529> doing<00:01:19.679> that<00:01:20.029> next<00:01:21.029> thing<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.329> I<00:01:21.539> put

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:21.779 
started doing that next thing that I put

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:26.980 
started doing that next thing that I put
in<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.079> is<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.659> stuff<00:01:24.899> right<00:01:25.109> here

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
in there is this stuff right here

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.529 
in there is this stuff right here
mushrooms<00:01:28.130> turkey<00:01:29.130> meat<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.670> fat<00:01:30.479> free

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
mushrooms turkey meat and fat free

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.349 
mushrooms turkey meat and fat free
cheese<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.459> these<00:01:32.609> already<00:01:33.029> measured

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
cheese so I have these already measured

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.309 
cheese so I have these already measured
out<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.899> viewing<00:01:34.829> ease<00:01:35.399> I<00:01:35.789> guess<00:01:36.179> so<00:01:37.049> one

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
out for viewing ease I guess so one

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.739 
out for viewing ease I guess so one
serving<00:01:37.709> of<00:01:37.859> fat-free<00:01:38.219> cheese<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.909> 28<00:01:39.359> grams

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
serving of fat-free cheese is 28 grams

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:46.370 
serving of fat-free cheese is 28 grams
or<00:01:40.259> nine<00:01:41.630> grams<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> protein<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:45.079> zero<00:01:46.079> fat

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
or nine grams of protein and zero fat

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.989 
or nine grams of protein and zero fat
maybe<00:01:46.709> a<00:01:46.859> carver<00:01:47.429> too<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.079> real<00:01:49.259> easy<00:01:49.289> to

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
maybe a carver too so it's real easy to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.659 
maybe a carver too so it's real easy to
add<00:01:50.999> in<00:01:51.209> protein<00:01:51.719> I<00:01:52.020> wouldn't<00:01:52.950> suggest<00:01:53.219> the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:53.669 
add in protein I wouldn't suggest the

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:56.239 
add in protein I wouldn't suggest the
protomen<00:01:54.479> fat-free<00:01:55.409> cheese<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.859> a<00:01:55.979> good

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
protomen fat-free cheese is a good

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.730 
protomen fat-free cheese is a good
source<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.700> protein<00:01:56.849> but<00:01:57.479> those<00:01:58.469> you're

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
source of protein but those you're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.059 
source of protein but those you're
hitting<00:01:59.039> your<00:01:59.189> macro<00:01:59.639> numbers<00:02:00.090> who<00:02:00.719> cares<00:02:01.069> so

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
hitting your macro numbers who cares so

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.339 
hitting your macro numbers who cares so
there's<00:02:02.249> 28<00:02:02.609> grams<00:02:03.029> on<00:02:03.389> the<00:02:03.419> fat-free<00:02:03.869> cheese

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
there's 28 grams on the fat-free cheese

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.719 
there's 28 grams on the fat-free cheese
or<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> push<00:02:04.919> the<00:02:05.039> tare<00:02:05.249> button<00:02:05.279> again

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
or going to push the tare button again

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.900 
or going to push the tare button again
one<00:02:06.389> serving<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.989> any<00:02:07.709> type<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> turkey<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
one serving of any type of turkey you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.630 
one serving of any type of turkey you
like<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.229> 56<00:02:11.009> grams<00:02:11.370> as

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
like so that's going to be 56 grams as

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.810 
like so that's going to be 56 grams as
one<00:02:11.820> serving<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.710> equals<00:02:13.860> nine<00:02:14.430> grams

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
one serving and that equals nine grams

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.720 
one serving and that equals nine grams
of<00:02:15.000> protein<00:02:15.210> also

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
of protein also

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.410 
of protein also
so<00:02:17.730> right<00:02:18.210> there<00:02:18.420> 57<00:02:19.320> close<00:02:19.590> enough<00:02:19.980> then<00:02:20.760> next

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
so right there 57 close enough then next

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.030 
so right there 57 close enough then next
I'm<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.020> break<00:02:22.740> in<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I'm going to do is break in the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.810 
I'm going to do is break in the
mushrooms<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.650> don't<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:25.980> mushrooms<00:02:26.370> or

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
mushrooms if you don't like mushrooms or

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
think one Snickers born which would be

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.720 
think one Snickers born which would be
just<00:05:06.230> like<00:05:06.380> a<00:05:06.410> real<00:05:06.710> small<00:05:07.160> amount<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.580> this

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
just like a real small amount of this

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.960 
just like a real small amount of this
and<00:05:07.970> volume<00:05:08.450> of<00:05:08.630> food<00:05:08.810> no<00:05:09.560> I<00:05:09.590> was<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:09.970> 240

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
and volume of food no I was like 240

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.660 
and volume of food no I was like 240
calories<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.720> probably<00:05:12.560> like<00:05:12.650> this<00:05:12.920> right
