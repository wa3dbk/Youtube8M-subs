00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:10.310
 hello in france each of us 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.900
 consumes for 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.730
 to move to dress for himself 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.420
 heat to light for 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.660
 feed 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.470
 also to provide products and 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.070
 service we need 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.130
 the equivalent of 15 liters of oil 15 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.100
 liters of oil per day and by France 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:41.900
 at 15 liters of oil it is also 150 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 kilowatts hour that's the equivalent if we 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.190
 had to produce even if only 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.030
 part of that energy so we need 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.520
 every day 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.100
 if we had to produce it ourselves eh 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.140
 well what would this amount 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.470
 of energy that's what we're going to 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.060
 propose to see together at the legs 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.710
 the device we are going to serve 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.119
 it's just a bike a bike 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.270
 equipped with a pedal so we go 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.470
 pedal to produce energy eon 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.770
 will measure this driving energy 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.159
 this bike we have it coupled to a 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.899
 car alternator the battery that 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.689
 you see on the back is right there for 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.869
 excite the electro magnet of 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.840
 the alternator by no means he produces it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.229
 the energy that is going to be measured what we 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.729
 will be measured and what is the power 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.520
 instant of the person who is going 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.689
 pedaling me in this case and momentum 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.340
 of course will light up 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.109
 when I'm going to pedal for 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.499
 show that there is a lot of electricity 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.499
 produced 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.600
 I start pedaling the long lights 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.759
 and the power that I develop 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:09.819
 is displayed at the bottom right of the screen 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:16.090
 of May is always 70 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:19.150
 watts so to the pedalo we saw together 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.760
 that I was developing a power of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.860
 close to 70 watts 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.130
 I will not be able to pedal more than 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.250
 eight hours a day to have the 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.790
 amount of energy produced that your 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.620
 servant 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.370
 it's simple just multiply 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 this power 70 watts by the number 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:46.239
 hours that I could have gone 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:51.810
 70 x eight we are at 560 watts or at 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.180
 about 1 050 50 6 kilowatts hour 05 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.070
 kilowatt hour that's what every friend or 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.470
 could produce while pedaling for 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.430
 eight o'clock just now I have you 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.840
 says that in fact we consume 150 kilowatts 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.030
 hour so 300 times more than each 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.400
 year could produce what wants 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.110
 so to say that we have more than 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.000
 hire 300 slaves each for 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.150
 provide all those energies that we have 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.150
 need
