what's<00:02:21.550> going<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.790> happen<00:02:22.150> with<00:02:22.269> mountain

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
what's going to happen with mountain

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.000 
what's going to happen with mountain
laurel<00:02:22.689> is<00:02:22.959> quite<00:02:23.230> often<00:02:23.409> we'll<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:23.799> leaf

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
laurel is quite often we'll get a leaf

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.239 
laurel is quite often we'll get a leaf
spot<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:26.079> disease<00:02:26.439> is<00:02:26.709> going<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:26.920> stay<00:02:27.129> in

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
spot and the disease is going to stay in

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:27.930 
spot and the disease is going to stay in
the<00:02:27.340> lead

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
the lead

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.210 
the lead
so<00:02:28.360> when<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.630> rains<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.470> rainwater<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:30.070> going

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so when it rains the rainwater is going

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.770 
so when it rains the rainwater is going
to<00:02:30.280> make<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.790> disease<00:02:31.120> bounce<00:02:31.480> back<00:02:31.750> up

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to make all that disease bounce back up

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.260 
to make all that disease bounce back up
into<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.320> shrub<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.790> keep<00:02:33.940> spreading

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
into the shrub and just keep spreading

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.480 
into the shrub and just keep spreading
it<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:35.110> by<00:02:35.260> cleaning<00:02:35.560> those<00:02:35.800> leads<00:02:36.100> you'll

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
it so by cleaning those leads you'll

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.000 
it so by cleaning those leads you'll
prevent<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.970> spread<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.450> disease<00:02:38.010> when

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
prevent the spread of the disease when

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.050 
prevent the spread of the disease when
