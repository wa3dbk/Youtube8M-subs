00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.960
 Among the opponents of openness include the citizens' initiative Airport 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.810
 Tempelhof 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.379
 the citizens' initiative for the reuse of the airport Tempelhof 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.429
 the autofrei initiative lives just like the alliance Temple of open 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.549
 an association of airport opponents 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.839
 Nature Conservation Association the federal and NABU as well as Alliance 90 the Greens 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.119
 the main arguments of things are security risks 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:23.939
 aircraft noise 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.939
 Air pollution as well as unprofitability 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.229
 in fact, there is no need for land in the vicinity 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.629
 the surrounding residential areas in Neukölln and newly Tempelhof are strongly built 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.640
 the so-called roaming WMC sterile are barely present 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.580
 The airport does not meet the standards of a modern airport 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.550
 In addition, the Berlin would not be further on an inner-city airport 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.620
 reliant 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.180
 The decision of a common transport airport became in the nineties 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.390
 Never set time for an extra-urban airport would be ripe 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.360
 especially the unprofitability is an argument in the weight 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.629
 that's how the airport has been producing millions of euros since the fall of the Wall 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.420
 which would have to be absorbed by the profits in Tegel the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.079
 Airport opponents Hamm with argus eyes recorded the decline Temple UVS 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.530

 Stirling Airways leaving the airport 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 had completely stopped their flight operations Conti flight 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.430

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 Berlin special plane that he likes Hamburg 1 of the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.760
 Duration and III 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.540
 The reasons were according to opponents many times low demand for the offered 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.200
 aim 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.690
 cheaper prices of the competition or larger companies 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.750
 Possibility to exchange machines for common was Torn 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 and to change in one place 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.940
 The undisputed, however, seems the fact that is smaller 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.620
 Airlines on the market continue to have heavier than their larger 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.190
 competitors 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.890
 when he tore his connection to Saarbrücken for the winter timetable Nuzzi 08 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 gives up 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.210
 it could be because that other airlines such as Air Berlin the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.230
 Connection service possibly to cheaper airfares 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.909
 while RWE boasts 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.920
 Mesrine German cities as all other competitors to fly 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 if the chances of survival for airlines with smaller 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.929
 Machines getting worse 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.849
 A major legal concern is that the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.919
 piled 4000 complaints from residents of Schönefeld finally as 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.479
 could prove negative 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:22.419
 if Tempelhof is kept open 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.039
 the BI BPM grant in acute danger 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.049
 The Teague airport is also said to be closed when the baby is opened 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:28.439
 become 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.369
 possibly, however, the military part remains there 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.719
 to be able to manufacture governmentally 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.859
 The Berlin Senate, meanwhile, stumbles on its unfortunate airport policy 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:37.799
 around 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.599
 the newspaper three hastily prepared and incorrect notification of the 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.449
 the Berlin airport company of the operating obligation the Pokerface 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.499
 should liberate or consequently complain in court 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.179
 in the same year hitherto ruling mayor Wowereit still 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.700
 Copenhagen »and with the operators of the Tivoli 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.529
 to talk about investment 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.899
 In the pedigrees waterworks Jungfernheide and Enter Forest can do that 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.829
 Airport area Tempelhof into consideration 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.059
 a major shortcoming is certainly the late discussion on reuse 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.589
 of the airport there 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:09.579
 but no one knows exactly what with the building and the 386 hectares 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.909
 Terrain happens 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.909
 In 2007, the Berlin Senate announced an online discussion 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.879
 with interested citizens 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.999
 more than 900 proposals were received and Federal Council held 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.290
 while the Senator for Urban Development Ingeborg Junge-reyer im 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.369
 August 2007 for a large bath she pronounced 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.179
 The financial Senna expensive Sarrazin thought 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:29.679
 already the maggots out there 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:30.930
 and the airport was 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.379
 no Philips rose 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.010
 and also the ruling mayor Wowereit appreciated the value of the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.209
 Airport to zero 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.449
 Zuses see approval for the signature collection for 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.749
 Referendum by the community of interests City Airport 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:45.659
 by the arrogant behavior of lead SPD and Green politicians 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.749
 national and federal level to airport supporters 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.619
 the green-faction leader Renate Künast both the Volksbegehren one 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:54.889
 Bullying of the citizens 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:55.920
 Michelle Müller 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.780
 spd fraction chief in deal house 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.780
 for the signatures success in his temple Oberstimm respect to the strong 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.690
 Agitation beside area by the community of interests City Airport 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.029
 back 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.219
 on the eleventh of november 2010 the Tagesspiegel writes 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.909
 Müller speaks of nostalgia 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.219
 from the "misunderstanding" 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.449
 waste the buildings with the decommissioning 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.829
 to be dead 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.920
 he does not believe that it is after a large initial participation in the referendum 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.279
 still be much more votes 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.300
 as the constitutionalist Rupert Scholz of the CDU the need 

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:27.580
 a closure 4 percent and the baby legally doubted this 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 said Müller as such an opinion represents 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.110
 not be exempted 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.430
 It exists on the part of the proponents of the reproach of the Berlin senate trade 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.370
 arbitrary and the opinion of the citizens count nothing 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.710
 also in the Brandenburg state policy, the small airports must close 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.949
 there is resistance 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.169
 This is how the convoy of the Ministry of Economics Hans spoke of the CDU 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.100
 for keeping Tempelhof open to small business travelers 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.330
 finds trouble in the grand coalition was kindled 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.710
 leading Brandenburg politicians of the SPD and the left criticized him 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.439
 then sharp 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.939
 Politics is one thing 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.349
 but what about the economy 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.919
 who could profit from the closure of Tempelhof? 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.509
 The Confederation will be early interested in the military part of the airport 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:07.860
 Sign up for Tegel 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.919
 so a complete closure of Tegel's fun never comes into question 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.080
 this and a mere ferry but a definite possibility 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.509
 to hide the building and the land 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.229
 One third of the area is to be built according to the usage plan with Phone Gewerbe 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:21.889
 become 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.599
 Rumors circulate on the internet that they themselves are leading Berlin politicians in 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.219
 the nineties with property ownership in the entry lanes 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.029
 around Tempio 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.319
 in fact, scarselli Neukölln were especially at the time of the youngest 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.900
 Real estate booms in the capital until 2006 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.340
 as domestic and foreign investors very much in demand
