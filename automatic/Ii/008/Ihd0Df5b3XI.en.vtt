14 comfort batt installed into it and
this<00:01:14.820> gives<00:01:15.060> us<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.300> combined<00:01:15.690> effective<00:01:16.140> in

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this gives us a combined effective in

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.740 
this gives us a combined effective in
our<00:01:16.320> 20<00:01:16.800> wall<00:01:17.039> what<00:01:17.760> we<00:01:17.880> love<00:01:18.119> about<00:01:18.390> using<00:01:18.510> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
our 20 wall what we love about using the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
our 20 wall what we love about using the
rocks<00:01:18.960> although<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> won't<00:01:19.799> hold<00:01:20.010> moisture

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
rocks although is it won't hold moisture

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
rocks although is it won't hold moisture
in<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.939> wall<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.510> allows<00:01:21.869> us<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.740> some

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
in the wall this allows us to have some

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
in the wall this allows us to have some
drying<00:01:23.340> ability<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
drying ability and also because of that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.810 
drying ability and also because of that
it<00:01:25.470> doesn't<00:01:25.710> build<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.159> moisture<00:01:26.369> that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
it doesn't build up moisture that's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
it doesn't build up moisture that's
going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> cause<00:01:27.299> mold<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
going to cause mold then what we do is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
going to cause mold then what we do is
we<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> smart<00:01:29.640> membrane<00:01:30.000> by<00:01:30.180> certainteed

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
we put a smart membrane by certainteed

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
we put a smart membrane by certainteed
on<00:01:30.900> top<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
on top of this and then in the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
on top of this and then in the
summertime<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.759> allows<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> vapor<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
summertime it allows the vapor to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
summertime it allows the vapor to
migrate<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> wall<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.920> cuts<00:01:35.460> down

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
migrate out of the wall that cuts down

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.190 
migrate out of the wall that cuts down
on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> opportunity<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.479> mold<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> creates<00:01:37.080> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
on the opportunity for mold it creates a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
on the opportunity for mold it creates a
drier<00:01:37.680> basement<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.640> creates<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> healthier

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
drier basement it creates a healthier

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.670 
drier basement it creates a healthier
living<00:01:39.570> environment<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.500> better

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
living environment and it's a better

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
living environment and it's a better
performing<00:01:41.189> wall<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.610> we're<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:41.759> very

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
performing wall so we're very very

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.660 
performing wall so we're very very
pleased<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.630> work<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.810> rocks<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.500> wall

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
pleased to work with rocks on this wall

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.859 
pleased to work with rocks on this wall
so<00:01:44.670> here's<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.939> couple<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.630> really

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so here's a couple of more really

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.120 
so here's a couple of more really
important<00:01:46.229> features<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.740> optimum

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
important features of the optimum

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
important features of the optimum
basement<00:01:47.549> wall<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.970> first<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.259> are

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
basement wall the first one is we are

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
basement wall the first one is we are
creating<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.860> continuous<00:01:50.189> air<00:01:50.700> barrier<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
creating a continuous air barrier on the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.819 
creating a continuous air barrier on the
inside<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> prevent<00:01:52.560> air

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
inside and that's to prevent air

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.609 
inside and that's to prevent air
migration<00:01:53.670> into<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> wall<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.140> take<00:01:55.380> our

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
migration into the wall so we take our

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
migration into the wall so we take our
header<00:01:55.890> wrap<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.729> put<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.119> smart

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
header wrap and we put this smart

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
header wrap and we put this smart
membrane<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.110> against<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.829> tape<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
membrane up against it and tape it so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819 
membrane up against it and tape it so
it's<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.610> sealed<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.840> lap<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.409> six<00:02:01.649> mil

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it's all sealed then we lap the six mil

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.980 
it's all sealed then we lap the six mil
poly<00:02:02.130> over<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> certainteed<00:02:03.689> smart

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
poly over top of the certainteed smart

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
poly over top of the certainteed smart
membrane<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.130> taped<00:02:05.399> along

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
membrane and that again is taped along

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.550 
membrane and that again is taped along
the<00:02:05.820> seams<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.899> down<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the seams and then down here at the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
the seams and then down here at the
bottom<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.549> six<00:02:08.790> mil<00:02:08.940> poly<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.540> that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
bottom we have the six mil poly and that

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470 
bottom we have the six mil poly and that
goes<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:10.229> over<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.160> also<00:02:11.340> taped<00:02:11.760> the

purpose of the laying of the materials

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.090 
purpose of the laying of the materials
is<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.420> want<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.690> create<00:02:15.900> drying<00:02:16.320> paths<00:02:16.620> so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
is we want to create drying paths so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
is we want to create drying paths so
there's<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.340> drying<00:02:17.610> path<00:02:17.880> at<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> top<00:02:18.510> which

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
there's a drying path at the top which

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.690 
there's a drying path at the top which
would<00:02:19.049> be<00:02:19.200> inward<00:02:19.590> bound<00:02:19.829> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.190> summertime

way here's another important part about

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.360 
way here's another important part about
the<00:02:34.450> optimum<00:02:34.840> basement<00:02:35.200> wall<00:02:35.349> up<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.040> your<00:02:36.190> joy

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the optimum basement wall up in your joy

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.820 
the optimum basement wall up in your joy
sense<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.880> actually<00:02:37.270> do<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> foam<00:02:37.780> skim<00:02:38.349> coat<00:02:38.560> in

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
sense we actually do a foam skim coat in

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.740 
sense we actually do a foam skim coat in
there<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.220> that's<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.580> air<00:02:39.730> barrier<00:02:40.120> also

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there and that's for air barrier also

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.780 
there and that's for air barrier also
for<00:02:41.170> vapor<00:02:41.380> migration<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.160> cuts<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.519> vapor

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
for vapor migration it cuts on a vapor

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.850 
for vapor migration it cuts on a vapor
migration<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:43.690> when<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.230> use<00:02:44.380> form<00:02:44.709> you've

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
migration but when you use form you've

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.190 
migration but when you use form you've
got<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.130> protect<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.269> what<00:02:46.630> we<00:02:46.660> do<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.080> we

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
got to protect it so what we do is we

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.870 
got to protect it so what we do is we

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
wall leaking when we know what's really

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.750 
wall leaking when we know what's really
happening<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.920> its<00:03:03.160> moisture<00:03:03.549> migration

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
happening is its moisture migration

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.520 
happening is its moisture migration
within<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.480> wall<00:03:04.660> getting<00:03:04.900> trapped<00:03:05.290> behind

the pauli when this happens the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.259 
the pauli when this happens the
insulation<00:03:08.230> get<00:03:08.620> quite<00:03:08.980> full<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.580> actually

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
insulation get quite full and actually

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.729 
insulation get quite full and actually
start<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.630> slump<00:03:10.930> because<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.319> gravity<00:03:11.680> is

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
start to slump because the gravity is

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.680 
start to slump because the gravity is
pulling<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.099> down<00:03:12.280> when<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.150> happens<00:03:13.569> you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
pulling it down when that happens you

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.000 
pulling it down when that happens you
end<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.080> cold<00:03:14.290> spot<00:03:14.470> at<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> top<00:03:14.860> of

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
end up with a cold spot at the top of

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.589 
end up with a cold spot at the top of
the<00:03:15.069> wall<00:03:15.250> which<00:03:15.459> makes<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.849> basement<00:03:16.239> colder

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
the wall which makes the basement colder

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.940 
the wall which makes the basement colder
the<00:03:16.870> other<00:03:17.019> thing<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.680> when<00:03:17.830> this

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
the other thing is is when this

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.970 
the other thing is is when this
insulation<00:03:18.519> gets<00:03:18.640> full<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.330> an<00:03:19.450> oyster<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.650> can

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
insulation gets full of an oyster it can

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.440 
insulation gets full of an oyster it can
actually<00:03:21.160> build<00:03:21.640> up<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.090> wall<00:03:22.330> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
actually build up in this wall and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.470 
actually build up in this wall and
create<00:03:22.569> mold<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.349> mildew<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.950> rot<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:25.269> we've

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
create mold and mildew and rot so we've

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.030 
create mold and mildew and rot so we've
worked<00:03:25.660> with<00:03:25.810> rocks<00:03:26.110> all<00:03:26.349> because<00:03:26.680> we<00:03:26.830> love

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
worked with rocks all because we love

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.320 
worked with rocks all because we love
the<00:03:27.190> fact<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.670> rocks<00:03:27.910> hole<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.180> going<00:03:28.269> to

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
the fact that the rocks hole is going to

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.000 
the fact that the rocks hole is going to
hold<00:03:28.599> its<00:03:28.780> shape<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.320> not<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.859> that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
hold its shape and not have that

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.220 
hold its shape and not have that
slumping<00:03:30.489> problem<00:03:30.820> at<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.030> top<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:32.079> other

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
slumping problem at the top the other

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.170 
slumping problem at the top the other
thing<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.709> with<00:03:32.920> rock<00:03:33.220> salt<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.640> won't<00:03:33.910> hold

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
thing is with rock salt it won't hold

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.030 
thing is with rock salt it won't hold
moisture<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.079> allows<00:03:35.290> vapor<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.859> flow

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
moisture because it allows vapor to flow

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.009 
moisture because it allows vapor to flow
through<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.359> that<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.810> not

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
through it because of that it's not

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.810 
through it because of that it's not
going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> trap<00:03:38.560> moisture<00:03:38.799> within<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.489> wall

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
going to trap moisture within this wall

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.300 
going to trap moisture within this wall
we<00:03:40.510> love<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.900> project<00:03:41.380> because<00:03:41.950> it's<00:03:42.160> going

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
we love that project because it's going

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.860 
we love that project because it's going
to<00:03:42.400> make<00:03:42.579> for<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.819> healthier<00:03:43.299> basement<00:03:43.720> wall

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
to make for a healthier basement wall

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.780 
to make for a healthier basement wall
it's<00:03:44.140> going<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.380> make<00:03:44.560> for<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.799> much<00:03:45.130> drier<00:03:45.489> and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
it's going to make for a much drier and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.699 
it's going to make for a much drier and
a<00:03:45.880> much<00:03:46.180> warmer<00:03:46.569> basement<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.380> much<00:03:47.560> more

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
a much warmer basement so it's much more

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.099 
a much warmer basement so it's much more
comfortable<00:03:47.980> for<00:03:48.340> customers<00:03:48.819> so<00:03:49.630> we're<00:03:49.840> so

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.240 
we've created the best basement wall you
can<00:04:07.690> possibly<00:04:08.170> build<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.680> that's<00:04:08.829> why<00:04:09.040> we've

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
can possibly build and that's why we've

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.049 
can possibly build and that's why we've
named<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.850> optimum<00:04:10.450> basement<00:04:10.900> wall
