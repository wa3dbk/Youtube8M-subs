particularly<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.209> blizzard's<00:02:21.660> saying<00:02:21.870> they

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
particularly like blizzard's saying they

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.080 
particularly like blizzard's saying they
own<00:02:22.170> stuff<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.739> mainly<00:02:23.430> being<00:02:23.700> generated

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
own stuff it's mainly being generated

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.970 
own stuff it's mainly being generated
money<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.720> mean<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.050> bought<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.440> game<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.860> now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
money I mean I bought the game and now

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
money I mean I bought the game and now
the<00:02:26.040> replay<00:02:26.459> that's<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:26.940> my<00:02:27.180> play<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.110> then

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the replay that's just my play and then

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.280 
the replay that's just my play and then
making<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.530> cut<00:02:28.709> off<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:30.269> doesn't<00:02:31.080> sit<00:02:31.260> too

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
making a cut off it it doesn't sit too

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.870 
making a cut off it it doesn't sit too
well<00:02:31.440> with<00:02:31.620> me<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.130> think<00:02:32.459> it's<00:02:32.580> kind<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
well with me but I think it's kind of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.789 
well with me but I think it's kind of
necessary<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.690> achieve<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.349> other<00:02:34.560> stuff

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
necessary to achieve this other stuff

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.320 
necessary to achieve this other stuff
that<00:02:35.010> would<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.459> good<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.970> I'm<00:02:36.090> okay

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that would be really good so I'm okay

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.550 
that would be really good so I'm okay
with<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:37.110> right<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.870> my<00:02:39.989> opinion<00:02:40.200> it's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
with it all right in my opinion it's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.509 
with it all right in my opinion it's
actually<00:02:40.890> good<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.959> blizzard<00:02:43.069> is<00:02:44.069> making<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
actually good the blizzard is making it

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.729 
actually good the blizzard is making it
