you only give
us<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.290> 4,500<00:02:14.069> chips<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.430> 1,500<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.270> if

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
us you know 4,500 chips for 1,500 but if

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.729 
us you know 4,500 chips for 1,500 but if
you<00:02:15.390> look<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.840> structure<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.440> look<00:02:16.620> at

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
you look at that structure you look at

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.130 
you look at that structure you look at
our<00:02:16.920> levels<00:02:17.459> these<00:02:17.849> events<00:02:18.209> take<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.690> know<00:02:18.810> 30

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
our levels these events take you know 30

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.530 
our levels these events take you know 30
hours<00:02:19.920> sometimes<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.790> complete<00:02:20.910> once

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
hours sometimes more to complete once

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.390 
hours sometimes more to complete once
you<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:21.780> past<00:02:21.810> about<00:02:22.290> 2,000<00:02:22.860> players<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.310> can

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
you get past about 2,000 players you can

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.559 
you get past about 2,000 players you can
forget<00:02:23.610> about<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.940> some<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.180> these<00:02:24.270> go<00:02:24.540> for

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
forget about it some of these go for

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.530 
forget about it some of these go for
days<00:02:24.989> without<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:26.459> ton<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.880> chips<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.300> all<00:02:27.360> that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
days without a ton of chips and all that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.059 
days without a ton of chips and all that
this<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.780> because<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.170> structures<00:02:28.620> are<00:02:28.860> that

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
this is because the structures are that

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.830 
this is because the structures are that
good<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.819> now<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.269> take<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.599> same

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
good so now you can take the same

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.500 
good so now you can take the same
structure<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.040> add<00:02:32.250> 10<00:02:32.700> times<00:02:33.030> starting

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
structure and you add 10 times starting

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.990 
structure and you add 10 times starting
stack<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:34.200> 15,000<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.220> chips<00:02:35.459> then<00:02:35.849> it's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
stack like 15,000 and chips then it's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
stack like 15,000 and chips then it's
going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.150> last<00:02:36.360> even<00:02:36.569> longer<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.560> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
going to last even longer right and so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.220 
going to last even longer right and so
this<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.430> hit<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:40.110> know

fantastic that you know this event was

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.020 
fantastic that you know this event was
we<00:03:58.560> were<00:03:58.650> able<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.889> have<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.819> know<00:03:59.910> we

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
we were able to have it that you know we

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.750 
we were able to have it that you know we
that<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:01.230> players<00:04:01.500> wanted<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.609> they

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
that the players wanted it and that they

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.030 
that the players wanted it and that they
all<00:04:02.910> were<00:04:03.510> very<00:04:03.690> receiving<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.620> wanted<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
all were very receiving and wanted to

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.330

come<00:04:05.190> out<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.340> play<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:06.470> there's<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.680> 1<00:04:07.920> B

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
come out and play it there's a 1 B

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.550 
come out and play it there's a 1 B
flight<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.180> then<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.450> think<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.780> last<00:04:10.200> people

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
flight and then I think the last people

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.129 
flight and then I think the last people
are<00:04:10.829> signed<00:04:11.430> up<00:04:11.519> now<00:04:11.700> 820<00:04:12.540> are<00:04:12.720> starting<00:04:13.019> one

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
are signed up now 820 are starting one

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.880 
are signed up now 820 are starting one
maybe<00:04:13.290> even<00:04:13.470> even<00:04:13.859> later<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.579> going<00:04:14.730> to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
maybe even even later this is going to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.130 
maybe even even later this is going to
a<00:04:14.950> long<00:04:15.730> long<00:04:16.000> day<00:04:16.150> for<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.109> is

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
a long long day for you so this is

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.319 
a long long day for you so this is
easily<00:04:17.530> well<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.400> easy<00:04:18.640> math<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
easily well this is easy math if you

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.170 
easily well this is easy math if you
give<00:04:19.570> players<00:04:20.250> 15,000<00:04:21.250> starting<00:04:21.579> stack<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
give players 15,000 starting stack and a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.000 
give players 15,000 starting stack and a
structure<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.600> already<00:04:23.050> last<00:04:23.260> three<00:04:23.860> days

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
structure that already last three days

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.380 
structure that already last three days
with<00:04:24.250> two<00:04:24.370> thousand<00:04:24.820> players<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.210> then<00:04:25.300> you

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
with two thousand players and then you

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.420 
with two thousand players and then you
add<00:04:25.540> seven<00:04:26.020> thousand<00:04:26.410> players<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:27.280> know<00:04:27.370> you

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
add seven thousand players you know you

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.070 
add seven thousand players you know you
have<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.000> figure<00:04:28.300> out<00:04:28.420> how<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.690> fit<00:04:28.870> everything

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
have to figure out how to fit everything

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080 
have to figure out how to fit everything
into<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.500> box<00:04:29.710> right<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.400> i<00:04:30.550> know<00:04:30.610> i<00:04:30.730> can't

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
into the box right and i know i can't

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.290 
into the box right and i know i can't
sit<00:04:31.630> seven<00:04:32.440> thousand<00:04:32.830> players<00:04:33.010> at<00:04:33.370> once<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.270> i

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
sit seven thousand players at once so i

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
knew i had to make a decision early on

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.310 
knew i had to make a decision early on
how<00:04:36.490> i<00:04:36.520> could<00:04:36.730> get<00:04:36.910> everyone<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.450> so<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.230> know

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
and stuff i needed to make sure I had

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.430 
and stuff i needed to make sure I had
enough<00:04:45.010> space<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.940> cut<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.390> off<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.870> added<00:04:47.230> a

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
enough space so I cut it off I added a

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.400 
enough space so I cut it off I added a
second<00:04:47.770> flight<00:04:48.010> 45<00:04:48.820> TM<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.450> then<00:04:49.810> now<00:04:50.020> you

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
second flight 45 TM and then now you

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.110 
second flight 45 TM and then now you
know<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.650> that's<00:04:50.770> basically<00:04:50.980> me<00:04:51.430> estimating

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
know and that's basically me estimating

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.460 
know and that's basically me estimating
how<00:04:52.450> many<00:04:52.630> tables<00:04:52.990> am<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.200> going<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.380> have

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
how many tables am I going to have

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.260 
how many tables am I going to have
available<00:04:53.980> from<00:04:54.190> twelve<00:04:54.490> o'clock<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:55.060> five

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
available from twelve o'clock to five

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.570 
available from twelve o'clock to five
o'clock<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:55.870> you<00:04:56.620> know<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.740> think<00:04:56.890> I<00:04:57.130> estimated

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
o'clock so you know I think I estimated

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.159 
o'clock so you know I think I estimated
pretty<00:04:57.760> good<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.300> hopefully<00:04:58.480> our<00:04:58.720> numbers

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
pretty good and hopefully our numbers

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.710 
pretty good and hopefully our numbers
fall<00:04:59.620> in<00:04:59.800> line<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.220> then<00:05:00.640> I<00:05:00.669> did<00:05:01.030> light<00:05:01.419> waves

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
fall in line and then I did light waves

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.940 
fall in line and then I did light waves
once<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.140> got<00:05:02.290> to<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.470> point<00:05:02.650> where<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:02.919> said

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
once I got to the point where I said

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.460 
once I got to the point where I said
okay<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.490> can<00:05:03.850> only<00:05:04.120> have<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.840> many<00:05:05.080> tables

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
okay I can only have this many tables

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.630 
okay I can only have this many tables
because<00:05:05.560> all<00:05:05.770> I'm<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.130> have<00:05:06.250> everything

on<00:05:40.180> how<00:05:40.240> many<00:05:40.419> tables<00:05:40.900> are<00:05:40.960> going<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.140> break

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
on how many tables are going to break

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.590

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
i I'm not that good at poke about yeah

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.360 
i I'm not that good at poke about yeah
it<00:06:24.910> sounds<00:06:25.240> still<00:06:25.720> doable<00:06:26.050> yeah<00:06:26.710> of<00:06:27.100> course

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
it sounds still doable yeah of course

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.250 
it sounds still doable yeah of course
yeah<00:06:27.550> i<00:06:27.580> mean<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:28.090> structure<00:06:28.480> at<00:06:28.780> this<00:06:29.020> point

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
yeah i mean the structure at this point

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.750 
yeah i mean the structure at this point
even<00:06:29.380> starting<00:06:29.770> at<00:06:29.860> midnight<00:06:29.980> it<00:06:30.550> would<00:06:30.670> be

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
even starting at midnight it would be

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.280 
even starting at midnight it would be
equivalent<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.210> maybe<00:06:31.420> starting<00:06:31.780> like<00:06:31.990> level

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
equivalent to maybe starting like level

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.170 
equivalent to maybe starting like level
2<00:06:32.320> or<00:06:32.470> 3<00:06:32.830> in<00:06:33.010> the<00:06:33.250> regular<00:06:33.580> structure<00:06:33.970> so<00:06:34.120> you

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
2 or 3 in the regular structure so you

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.690 
2 or 3 in the regular structure so you
really<00:06:34.780> in<00:06:34.960> terms<00:06:35.590> of<00:06:35.830> missing<00:06:36.220> a<00:06:36.280> lot<00:06:36.400> of<00:06:36.520> play

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
really in terms of missing a lot of play
