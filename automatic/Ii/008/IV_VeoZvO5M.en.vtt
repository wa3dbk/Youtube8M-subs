I met the Loom our booth learning an
advanced<00:00:02.790> heat<00:00:03.030> forming<00:00:03.419> technique<00:00:03.870> used<00:00:04.170> on

category 5 back glass Dave can you tell
me<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> little<00:00:07.740> bit<00:00:07.919> about<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.309> technique

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
me a little bit about this technique

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.280 
me a little bit about this technique
what<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.090> called<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.630> some<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> history

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
what it's called in some of the history

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.650 
what it's called in some of the history
behind<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.769> yes<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.759> technique<00:00:12.240> right<00:00:12.420> here

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
behind it yes this technique right here

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.720 
behind it yes this technique right here
is<00:00:12.750> an<00:00:12.870> advanced<00:00:13.349> technique<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.160> started

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
is an advanced technique that started

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.090 
is an advanced technique that started
probably<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.179> Arizona<00:00:15.719> about<00:00:16.320> 15<00:00:16.770> years<00:00:16.980> ago

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
probably on Arizona about 15 years ago

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.359 
probably on Arizona about 15 years ago
and<00:00:17.609> just<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:18.359> everything<00:00:18.690> happens<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:20.039> word

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
and just like everything happens at word

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.540 
and just like everything happens at word
of<00:00:20.490> mouth<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.210> techniques<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.550> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
of mouth and in techniques get out this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.820 
of mouth and in techniques get out this
has<00:00:23.699> become<00:00:23.789> very<00:00:23.970> very<00:00:24.869> popular<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.619> it's

what he's doing and so dealers can do
this<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.449> Amanda<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.710> want<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.979> leave<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> lot

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this sure Amanda you want to leave a lot

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.179 
this sure Amanda you want to leave a lot
of<00:01:05.460> excess<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.780> top<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> grab<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of excess on the top so you can grab and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
of excess on the top so you can grab and
pull<00:01:08.250> those<00:01:08.580> fingers<00:01:09.030> vertically<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:10.049> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
pull those fingers vertically and as you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.690 
pull those fingers vertically and as you
pull<00:01:10.380> them<00:01:10.439> vertically<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> lift<00:01:11.460> up

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
pull them vertically you want to lift up

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
pull them vertically you want to lift up
off<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> glass<00:01:12.330> also<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:13.979> running

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
off the glass also and as you're running

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.649 
off the glass also and as you're running
your<00:01:14.430> heat<00:01:14.670> let<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> heat<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> work<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
your heat let the heat do the work for

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.050 
your heat let the heat do the work for
you<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.560> lays<00:01:16.830> right<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> glass

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you but it just lays right on the glass

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
you but it just lays right on the glass
it's<00:01:19.009> definitely<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> lot<00:01:20.340> easier<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.240> simpler

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's definitely a lot easier and simpler

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's definitely a lot easier and simpler
to<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.920> normal<00:01:23.689> shrinking<00:01:24.689> techniques<00:01:25.080> if

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to do the normal shrinking techniques if

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.280 
to do the normal shrinking techniques if
you<00:01:26.100> don't<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.640> excess<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you don't have that excess up there you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.950 
you don't have that excess up there you
can't<00:01:28.560> pull<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.250> fingers<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> down<00:01:30.540> there

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
can't pull the fingers up and down there

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.590 
can't pull the fingers up and down there
is<00:01:31.079> easy<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:33.090> easier<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.479> have

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
is easy and it's a lot easier to have

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.219 
is easy and it's a lot easier to have
creases<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.409> burn<00:01:35.189> marks<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
creases and burn marks we all know that

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
creases and burn marks we all know that
some<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.380> cars<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> Corvettes<00:01:38.400> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
some of these cars like the Corvettes I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
some of these cars like the Corvettes I
wouldn't<00:01:38.909> even<00:01:39.150> want<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> attempt<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.930> without

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
wouldn't even want to attempt it without

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.719 
wouldn't even want to attempt it without
