00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
out here this is my test of the Fitbit

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.440 
out here this is my test of the Fitbit
surge<00:00:06.960> right<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.670> rain<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.360> gonna

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
surge right here in the rain we're gonna

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.919 
surge right here in the rain we're gonna
go<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.990> light<00:00:10.230> three-mile<00:00:11.190> run<00:00:11.809> see<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:12.840> it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
go for a light three-mile run see how it

00:00:12.929 --> 00:02:54.640 
go for a light three-mile run see how it
goes

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.770 

hey<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.159> was<00:02:56.189> my<00:02:56.519> second<00:02:57.180> test<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.689> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
hey so that was my second test of the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.750 
hey so that was my second test of the
Fitbit<00:02:58.170> surge<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.739> was<00:02:58.829> actually<00:02:59.159> quite<00:02:59.430> fun

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
Fitbit surge and was actually quite fun

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.550 
Fitbit surge and was actually quite fun
to<00:03:00.030> go<00:03:00.180> out<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.450> run<00:03:00.689> when<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.019> was<00:03:01.140> raining

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to go out and run when it was raining

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.929 
to go out and run when it was raining
outside<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.129> wasn't<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.489> whole<00:03:02.670> lot<00:03:02.700> of

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
outside there wasn't a whole lot of

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.880 
outside there wasn't a whole lot of
people<00:03:03.239> out<00:03:03.359> there<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:03.930> at<00:03:04.049> any<00:03:04.200> rate<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.680> did

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
people out there but at any rate it did

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.410 
people out there but at any rate it did
allow<00:03:05.159> me<00:03:05.189> to<00:03:05.340> play<00:03:05.640> around<00:03:05.879> with<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> device

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
allow me to play around with the device

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.360 
allow me to play around with the device
a<00:03:06.450> little<00:03:06.689> more<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.200> clearly<00:03:07.650> check<00:03:08.040> up<00:03:08.220> on

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
a little more and clearly check up on

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.610 
a little more and clearly check up on
how<00:03:08.489> water-resistant<00:03:09.329> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.230> also<00:03:10.379> had

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
how water-resistant it is and I also had

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.830 
how water-resistant it is and I also had
a<00:03:10.650> chance<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.250> benchmark<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> GPS<00:03:12.450> tracking

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
a chance to benchmark the GPS tracking

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.899 
a chance to benchmark the GPS tracking
system<00:03:13.409> against<00:03:13.709> Strava<00:03:14.069> again<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.670> this

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
system against Strava again and this

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.940 
system against Strava again and this
time<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.299> result<00:03:15.629> was<00:03:15.840> quite<00:03:16.019> interesting<00:03:16.769> if

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
time the result was quite interesting if

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.190 
time the result was quite interesting if
you<00:03:17.129> saw<00:03:17.340> my<00:03:17.549> prior<00:03:17.970> video<00:03:18.389> testing<00:03:18.930> out<00:03:19.049> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you saw my prior video testing out the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.140 
you saw my prior video testing out the
surge<00:03:19.409> you'd<00:03:19.769> see<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.190> Fitbit<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.760> Strava

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
surge you'd see that Fitbit and Strava

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.000 
surge you'd see that Fitbit and Strava
recorded<00:03:21.690> similar<00:03:22.139> numbers<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:22.980> overall

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
recorded similar numbers for overall

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.800 
recorded similar numbers for overall
distance<00:03:23.909> traveled

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
distance traveled

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.890 
distance traveled
but<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.230> Fitbit<00:03:25.680> map<00:03:25.980> was<00:03:26.310> way<00:03:26.790> off<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.569> added

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
but the Fitbit map was way off it added

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.569 
but the Fitbit map was way off it added
a<00:03:27.989> section<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.560> my<00:03:28.680> run<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.129> didn't<00:03:29.489> even

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
a section to my run that I didn't even

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.640 
a section to my run that I didn't even
go<00:03:29.909> on<00:03:30.090> well<00:03:30.659> this<00:03:30.870> time<00:03:31.109> you'll<00:03:31.379> see<00:03:31.530> that

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
go on well this time you'll see that

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.740 
go on well this time you'll see that
Strava<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.370> my<00:03:32.609> iPhone<00:03:32.790> rather<00:03:33.209> lost

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
Strava or my iPhone rather lost

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210 
Strava or my iPhone rather lost
connection<00:03:34.349> with<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.590> satellites<00:03:35.069> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
connection with the satellites and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.039 
connection with the satellites and
therefore<00:03:35.700> didn't<00:03:36.060> track<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.480> first<00:03:36.659> part<00:03:36.959> of

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
therefore didn't track the first part of

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.229 
therefore didn't track the first part of
my<00:03:37.139> run<00:03:37.349> that<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:37.980> most<00:03:38.280> likely<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.879> reason

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
my run that was most likely the reason

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.970 
my run that was most likely the reason
that<00:03:39.359> Fitbit<00:03:39.750> showed<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> total<00:03:40.260> distance<00:03:40.620> of

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
that Fitbit showed a total distance of

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.860 
that Fitbit showed a total distance of
3.2<00:03:41.790> miles<00:03:42.030> while<00:03:42.389> Strava

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
3.2 miles while Strava

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.710 
3.2 miles while Strava
only<00:03:43.109> reported<00:03:43.560> 2.7<00:03:44.519> now<00:03:44.879> as<00:03:45.060> far<00:03:45.329> as<00:03:45.510> other

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
only reported 2.7 now as far as other

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.289 
only reported 2.7 now as far as other
stats<00:03:46.139> go<00:03:46.379> Strava<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.189> Fitbit<00:03:47.400> were<00:03:47.760> fairly

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
stats go Strava and Fitbit were fairly

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.599 
stats go Strava and Fitbit were fairly
similar<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.750> calories<00:03:49.410> burned<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:50.069> the

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
similar and calories burned and the

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.129 
similar and calories burned and the
heart<00:03:50.819> rate<00:03:50.849> data<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.480> Fitbit<00:03:51.750> seemed

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
heart rate data from Fitbit seemed

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.439 
heart rate data from Fitbit seemed
pretty<00:03:52.500> spot-on<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.730> suppose<00:03:54.090> didn't

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
pretty spot-on and I suppose didn't

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.939 
pretty spot-on and I suppose didn't
really<00:03:54.629> lose<00:03:54.780> connection<00:03:55.349> like<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.620> thought<00:03:55.769> it

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
really lose connection like I thought it

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.979 
really lose connection like I thought it
was<00:03:56.069> going<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.639> other<00:03:57.269> thing<00:03:57.660> that<00:03:57.690> you'll

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
was going to the other thing that you'll

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.960 
was going to the other thing that you'll
know<00:03:58.169> is<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.680> Fitbit<00:03:59.069> shows<00:03:59.310> your<00:03:59.519> calories

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
know is that Fitbit shows your calories

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.670 
know is that Fitbit shows your calories
burned<00:04:00.239> over<00:04:00.569> time<00:04:00.780> which<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.199> nice

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
burned over time which is nice

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
burned over time which is nice
but<00:04:01.889> it<00:04:02.010> also<00:04:02.190> displays<00:04:02.609> what<00:04:03.120> in<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.480> way<00:04:03.599> of

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
but it also displays what in the way of

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.319 
but it also displays what in the way of
steps<00:04:04.199> calories<00:04:04.949> burned<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.519> active<00:04:05.970> minutes

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
steps calories burned in active minutes

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.569 
steps calories burned in active minutes
the<00:04:06.629> workout<00:04:07.049> contributed<00:04:07.859> to<00:04:08.069> that<00:04:08.099> days

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
the workout contributed to that days

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.729 
the workout contributed to that days
statistics<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.780> was<00:04:09.959> actually<00:04:10.409> quite<00:04:10.620> a

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
statistics so it was actually quite a

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.409 
statistics so it was actually quite a
relief<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.459> see<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:11.940> Fitbit<00:04:12.239> surge

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
relief to see that the Fitbit surge

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.539 
relief to see that the Fitbit surge
functioned<00:04:13.139> really<00:04:13.560> well<00:04:13.769> during<00:04:13.979> this<00:04:14.250> test

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
functioned really well during this test

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.789 
functioned really well during this test
I<00:04:14.699> suppose<00:04:15.239> my<00:04:15.510> first<00:04:15.840> test<00:04:16.079> may<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.530> been<00:04:16.709> a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
I suppose my first test may have been a

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.379 
I suppose my first test may have been a
fluke<00:04:16.949> but<00:04:17.310> who<00:04:17.519> knows<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:18.000> guess<00:04:18.209> I'll<00:04:18.359> find

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
fluke but who knows I guess I'll find

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.289 
fluke but who knows I guess I'll find
