00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
okay so let's get started the first way

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.140 
okay so let's get started the first way
is<00:01:13.000> if<00:01:13.330> your<00:01:13.660> rabbit<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.290> eating<00:01:14.860> non-stop<00:01:15.150> its

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
is if your rabbit is eating non-stop its

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.270 
is if your rabbit is eating non-stop its
eating<00:01:16.480> like<00:01:16.660> anything<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.320> gave<00:01:17.500> like

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
eating like anything you gave like

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.880 
eating like anything you gave like
anything<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.820> give<00:01:19.060> them<00:01:19.390> they<00:01:20.230> eat<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.680> and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
anything you give them they eat it and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.490 
anything you give them they eat it and
before<00:01:21.850> they<00:01:21.970> were<00:01:22.000> pregnant<00:01:22.390> they<00:01:22.780> ate<00:01:23.080> but

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
before they were pregnant they ate but

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.710 
before they were pregnant they ate but

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
they didn't eat that much that is a one

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.790 
they didn't eat that much that is a one
concept<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.550> like<00:01:27.730> one<00:01:28.060> out<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:29.020> lot

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
concept that is like one out of a lot

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.730 
concept that is like one out of a lot

that<00:01:35.650> is<00:01:35.800> one<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.220> them<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.940> is<00:01:37.000> tip<00:01:37.300> number

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
that is one of them that is tip number

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.320 
that is one of them that is tip number
one<00:01:37.810> okay<00:01:38.470> tip<00:01:38.860> number<00:01:38.890> two<00:01:39.400> is<00:01:39.670> if<00:01:39.970> they<00:01:40.150> just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
one okay tip number two is if they just

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.840 
one okay tip number two is if they just
relax<00:01:40.750> all<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:40.960> time<00:01:41.200> they<00:01:41.920> don't<00:01:42.070> run

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
relax all the time they don't run

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.610 
relax all the time they don't run
they<00:01:43.000> don't<00:01:43.210> hop<00:01:43.540> they<00:01:43.960> don't<00:01:44.170> play<00:01:44.350> around

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620
