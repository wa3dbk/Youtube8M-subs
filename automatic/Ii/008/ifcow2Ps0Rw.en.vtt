00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.910
 today we make croissants for 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.520
 the dough 600 grams of semolina 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.180
 grinded durum wheat 280 grams of 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.520
 milk 150 g of yeast or 12 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.970
 grams of compressed yeast 10 grams of 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.109
 salt 50 grams of acacia honey 60 g 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.570
 of whole egg 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.960
 for the filling 100 grams of chocolate 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.420
 at 70 for 170 grams of raisins 40 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 grams of marsala therefore we have the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:43.590
 semolina the bakery once came 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:49.360
 precisely with the remilled semolina not 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.910
 we demonize the compressed yeast but if 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 we can use so much mother yeast 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.720
 better 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.550
 let's put honey into your honey 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.790
 appreciation the important thing is to try to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.560
 I recommend to find an Italian honey 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:09.670
 first mix the liquids with the milk a 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.990
 a temperature of 22 maximum 25 degrees 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:22.439
 let's put the salt and dough hook then 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:28.899
 here is the processing here must be 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:32.189
 quite smooth and soft it goes 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.700
 worked at least ten minutes to be able to 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.880
 have a result of compactness and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 elasticity 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.850
 now we put it to rise and there 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.639
 let's take the already leavened one we put 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:57.749
 and flour the flour you see does not 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:57.749
 sticking even if that is cotton 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.649
 we always spread to the rectangle because 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.459
 now we have to cut them we have the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.459
 chocolate 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.560
 I took 70 percent chocolate 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:21.090
 why why should you know that when 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 the chocolate is cooked it melts and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.850
 therefore also a chocolate becomes bitter 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.920
 if you put a milk chocolate 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.770
 I will completely miss a 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.230
 70 percent chocolate is a little bit 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:43.230
 more heat resistant 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.690
 here is ok, there are many for example 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.350
 people who do not like chocolate 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.780
 dark but I must say that then when it is 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.050
 therefore it is no longer heated 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:02.430
 I would try to avoid the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:08.280
 milk chocolate or more 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:12.300
 soft now we cut then I put to 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.360
 bathe the raisins with marsala 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.160
 now let's do the triangles who do it 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.519
 cut to wheel and then do the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.320
 mirrors but then you have to do them 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:33.800
 quite regular but this way i 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.800
 triangles are formed put 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.120
 I was from there, here it is 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 here then I said I put to soak 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.900
 in the marsala area 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.900
 now the drain 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.810
 then if you don't want to use your heart 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.880
 it is enough only to put them with a little bit 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.400
 of warm water 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.510
 because not everyone loves liquor I leave 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.349
 let's go now let's form the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.799
 croissants 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:19.060
 here it is and we put a little piece of it 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:22.050
 chocolate is a little bit of raisins not 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:27.750
 exceed with the filling 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:31.810
 here they are and we put on the baking sheet 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.560
 look at who beautiful croissants who 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.560
 never would have said 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.290
 you will see how wonderful we are there 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.760
 let's just put some flour on it 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:52.830
 always of the same semolina and we make them 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:55.389
 to avoid another 30 40 minutes after which 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:01.479
 we wait for them to rise and we put them 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:04.530
 in the oven at 200 degrees for 20 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.930
 minutes but we have to see the coloring 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.940
 as in all other small products 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.229
 small pieces that we put in 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.080
 oven 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.169
 we need not to make them harden 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.110
 of a high temperature with steam 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.470
 so let's take that torina with the 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 ice and put it inside the 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.639
 ice a with the heat of the oven 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:35.620
 very hot it releases all the steam e 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:38.320
 therefore it creates this steam makes the breads 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.200
 net or what we put small 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.280
 size will cook them and let them stay 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.660
 soft 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:51.310
 look at how wonderful it is now 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.740
 we give him a nice cut do not want it 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.479
 break 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.479
 here it is, they are very soft
