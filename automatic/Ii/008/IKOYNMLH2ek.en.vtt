00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.240 
going to print out and here I'm talking
both<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.260> your<00:00:28.439> inkjet<00:00:28.650> printer<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
both about your inkjet printer that you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
both about your inkjet printer that you
have<00:00:29.369> setting<00:00:29.640> off<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> your<00:00:30.029> right<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.330> well

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
have setting off to your right as well

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.889 
have setting off to your right as well
as<00:00:31.109> huge<00:00:31.890> production<00:00:32.340> printers<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
as huge production printers use this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
as huge production printers use this
color<00:00:34.140> model<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.680> order<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> create<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
color model in order to create the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.110 
color model in order to create the
images<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.300> paper<00:00:37.550> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> would<00:00:38.820> open<00:00:38.940> up

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
images on paper if you would open up

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
images on paper if you would open up
your<00:00:39.239> inkjet<00:00:39.480> printer<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.050> take<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> look<00:00:40.980> at

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
your inkjet printer and take a look at

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
your inkjet printer and take a look at
the<00:00:41.160> ink<00:00:41.309> cartridges<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.450> might<00:00:42.690> see

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the ink cartridges you might see

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
the ink cartridges you might see
something<00:00:43.260> similar<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:45.360> reason

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
something similar to this and the reason

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
something similar to this and the reason
that<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:47.280> way<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.550> printer

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that is is because the way your printer

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.920 
that is is because the way your printer
works<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> similar<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.809> in

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
works is similar to the way in

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
works is similar to the way in
industrial<00:00:49.379> printer<00:00:49.649> works<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
industrial printer works and that is it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
industrial printer works and that is it
combines<00:00:51.020> these<00:00:52.020> four<00:00:52.500> colors<00:00:52.860> yellow

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
combines these four colors yellow

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.639 
combines these four colors yellow
magenta<00:00:53.430> cyan<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.120> black<00:00:54.180> some<00:00:55.110> printers<00:00:55.410> add

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
magenta cyan and black some printers add

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.860 
magenta cyan and black some printers add
a<00:00:55.680> light<00:00:56.160> cyan<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> light<00:00:56.850> magenta<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.539> even

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a light cyan a light magenta and even

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
a light cyan a light magenta and even
maybe<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> light<00:00:58.379> yellow<00:00:58.879> they<00:00:59.879> combine<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
maybe a light yellow they combine all of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.580 
maybe a light yellow they combine all of
these<00:01:00.420> colors<00:01:00.629> print<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> page

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
these colors print them out on the page

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
these colors print them out on the page
and<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.010> produces<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.579> images<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and that produces the images that you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.679 
and that produces the images that you
see<00:01:04.129> when<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.220> prints<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:06.299> you're<00:01:06.420> doing<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
see when it prints out if you're doing a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.719 
see when it prints out if you're doing a
lot<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> print<00:01:07.110> work<00:01:07.170> oftentimes<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.430> printer

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
lot of print work oftentimes the printer

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
lot of print work oftentimes the printer
will<00:01:08.880> send<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> color<00:01:09.540> profile<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
will send you a color profile that you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
will send you a color profile that you
can<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.070> load<00:01:11.250> into<00:01:11.520> Photoshop<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.750> will

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can then load into Photoshop and it will

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.960 
can then load into Photoshop and it will
match<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.200> color<00:01:13.500> settings<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.310> Photoshop

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
match your color settings in Photoshop

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910 
match your color settings in Photoshop
to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> actual<00:01:15.840> colors<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> they're<00:01:16.560> using

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
to the actual colors that they're using

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.270 
to the actual colors that they're using
in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> printers<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.659> does<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.840> work

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
in the printers so how does this work

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
in the printers so how does this work
well<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.610> were<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> take<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> look<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
well if we were to take a look at the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.950 
well if we were to take a look at the
CMYK<00:01:22.229> color<00:01:22.920> model<00:01:23.009> CMYK<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> subtractive

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
CMYK color model CMYK is a subtractive

CMYK color model CMYK is a subtractive
color<00:01:25.020> model<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.130> talked<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
color model and we just talked about the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.550 
color model and we just talked about the
RGB<00:01:27.060> color<00:01:27.299> model<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> previous<00:01:28.020> video

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
RGB color model in the previous video

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.719 
RGB color model in the previous video
this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> basically<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> opposite<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
this is basically the opposite of that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.999 
this is basically the opposite of that
when<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> mix<00:01:32.939> these<00:01:33.090> colors<00:01:33.420> together

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
when you mix these colors together

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
when you mix these colors together
yellow<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.159> cyan<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.670> give<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> green<00:01:36.119> cyan

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
yellow and cyan will give you green cyan

the<00:01:40.049> yellow<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.470> magenta<00:01:40.710> give<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.369> red

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the yellow and magenta give you that red

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
the yellow and magenta give you that red

black originally if a printing press
were<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> print<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.009> image<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.810> there

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
were to print out this image here there

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.550 
were to print out this image here there
are<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> couple<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.140> different<00:01:49.409> ways<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
are a couple of different ways to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530 
are a couple of different ways to
achieve<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.970> first<00:01:51.149> process

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
achieve this and the first process

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.109 
achieve this and the first process
basically<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.560> comprised<00:01:52.950> only<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> cyan

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
basically was comprised only of the cyan

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.660 
basically was comprised only of the cyan
magenta<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.140> yellow<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.310> reason<00:01:56.549> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
magenta and yellow and the reason this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
magenta and yellow and the reason this
is<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.509> said<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> subtractive

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
is because as I said it's a subtractive

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.980 
is because as I said it's a subtractive
color<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.189> color<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.820> add<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
color so the more color that you add the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
color so the more color that you add the
darker<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> image<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.909> for

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
darker the image is going to be so for

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.639 
darker the image is going to be so for
the<00:02:03.180> black<00:02:03.360> areas<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.350> barn

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the black areas over here on this barn

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.530 
the black areas over here on this barn
you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.640> these<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> filled<00:02:06.390> in

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you can see that these are the filled in

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.440 
you can see that these are the filled in
areas<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.110> every<00:02:07.500> single<00:02:07.649> color<00:02:07.979> plate

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
areas on every single color plate

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.490 
areas on every single color plate
eventually<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.539> became<00:02:09.810> expensive<00:02:10.349> because

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
eventually this became expensive because

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
eventually this became expensive because
now<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.860> order<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> achieve<00:02:11.250> black<00:02:11.730> we're

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
now in order to achieve black we're

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
now in order to achieve black we're
using<00:02:12.150> cyan<00:02:12.900> magenta<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.440> yellow

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
using cyan magenta and yellow

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.140 
using cyan magenta and yellow
so<00:02:14.569> printers<00:02:15.569> added<00:02:15.990> black<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> mix

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so printers added black to the mix

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.699 
so printers added black to the mix
here's<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.330> exact<00:02:18.630> same<00:02:18.840> image<00:02:19.080> with<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
here's that exact same image with a

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.160 
here's that exact same image with a
black<00:02:20.010> plate<00:02:20.310> at<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.810> we

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
black plate at it so you can see here we

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.960 
black plate at it so you can see here we
don't<00:02:22.349> need<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> add<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:23.160> three<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> these

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
don't need to add all three of these

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.820 
don't need to add all three of these
colors<00:02:24.180> together<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> shadows<00:02:25.800> of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
colors together to get the shadows of

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.770 
colors together to get the shadows of
the<00:02:26.069> barn<00:02:26.310> because<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.090> black<00:02:27.300> takes<00:02:27.569> care<00:02:27.750> of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the barn because the black takes care of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
the barn because the black takes care of
that<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.200> us<00:02:28.550> yes<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.700> does<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.030> add<00:02:30.150> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
that for us yes this does is add a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180 
that for us yes this does is add a
fourth<00:02:30.540> ink<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:31.530> again<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.160> said

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
fourth ink but now again like I said

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.070 
fourth ink but now again like I said
we're<00:02:32.550> not<00:02:32.670> adding<00:02:32.880> every<00:02:33.330> single<00:02:33.690> color<00:02:33.870> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
we're not adding every single color in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.449 
we're not adding every single color in
equal<00:02:34.350> amounts<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.739> thing<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> black

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
equal amounts of thing to get a black

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.460 
equal amounts of thing to get a black
color<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.600> there's<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:36.840> basic<00:02:37.170> description

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
color so there's your basic description

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.620 
color so there's your basic description
of<00:02:37.590> CMYK<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.580> said<00:02:38.640> mostly<00:02:39.450> you're

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
of CMYK and like I said mostly you're

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.670 
of CMYK and like I said mostly you're
going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:39.989> this<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.319> you're<00:02:40.440> doing

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
going to use this if you're doing

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.170 
going to use this if you're doing
anything<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:41.160> print<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.850> you're<00:02:42.000> doing

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
anything for print if you're doing

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.780 
anything for print if you're doing
posters<00:02:42.600> or<00:02:42.840> shirts<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.410> signs<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.400> any<00:02:44.519> kind

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
posters or shirts or signs of any kind

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.880 
posters or shirts or signs of any kind
and<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.959> work<00:02:46.110> with<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.319> printer<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and you have to work with a printer and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.400 
and you have to work with a printer and
by<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.519> mean<00:02:47.550> an<00:02:47.940> industrial<00:02:48.720> printer<00:02:49.050> not

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
by this I mean an industrial printer not

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.990 
by this I mean an industrial printer not
in<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.190> printer<00:02:50.459> next<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.760> your<00:02:50.880> desk

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
in the printer next to your desk

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.550 
in the printer next to your desk
although<00:02:51.360> as<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.630> discussed<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.080> works<00:02:52.410> in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
although as we discussed that works in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.259 
although as we discussed that works in
the<00:02:52.650> similar<00:02:52.920> method<00:02:53.310> then<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the similar method then this is the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.180 
the similar method then this is the
color<00:02:54.510> mode<00:02:54.720> you're<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.049> use<00:02:55.200> well

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
color mode you're going to use well

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.220 
color mode you're going to use well
