00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:12.980
 here removed in the nozzle and what you need 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.309
 pay attention 1 integrity this 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.310
 it is clear yes the horse is clear they are whole 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:29.989
 first promoted if soot here 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:32.509
 there is a little on this place but 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.070
 a little ride and should be because 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.449
 gas from the cylinder breaks through 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.579
 him laying and deposited on the body 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.769
 soot is eaten by cylinders and 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.949
 accordingly, if you have a lot here 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.660
 plant but you got me very little that is 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.449
 copper strip worked well and if 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.519
 you have a lot of soot here seen 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:57.280
 wore soot it means you have a problem with 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.749
 this seal suspension 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.000
 Well , the most important thing is to pay 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:09.159
 attention to the sprayer itself 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.869
 that's how it is covered with a layer of soot 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.250
 that is, I have basically a motor 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.500
 it works well soot for me practically 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.869
 No, well, some plaque should of course 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.509
 be but as you can see here as well, just hand 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.240
 I'm a nozzle from the engine, I just pull 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.960
 finger, she actually erased 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.960
 almost all 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 that is, there is a small tank on the elephant 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:48.460
 I want him a little bit want a doctor but no 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.860
 grand flakes that is if you 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.740
 flakes appeared once the shoulders you pulled out 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.930
 nozzle means you have the wrong 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.479
 ignition of diesel fuel 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:06.070
 1 Actually here we open the nozzle 44 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.220
 de look at the sprayer and this motor 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.040
 and on this motor's spray this 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.280
 motor sprayer and black coated 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.950
 soot is what does it mean 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.170
 blending cylinder was here 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.790
 giving it is clearly visible not very 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.520
 right with the motor in this engine 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.720
 soot formed intensively 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.630
 reasons can be very but why 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.450
 blending is wrong but it's like 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.060
 the candle can be determined immediately in these 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.489
 zeros we plant a lot of diesel fuel 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:46.500
 darrell wrong here are two identical 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.990
 engine kit 1 set gola 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.620
 all taken down for prevention and here 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.570
 see and correct a lot of soot is not about 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.060
 ignition of the fuel here is correct here 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.410
 such here 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.560
 nozzles after the engine is running 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.410
 pulled looked there soot mean 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.550
 look for the reason why you had soot 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.310
 pulled them out to nice and 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.300
 good done prophylactic correctness 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:21.530
 they put back means blend you up 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.530
 great as it should be so 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.900
 Here removed means the engine nozzle and 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.870
 now we will check him jumping where 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.870
 take search data here this manual 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.370
 did just about exploitation and 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:46.689
 injection pressure 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.409
 for 175 engine 142 plus minus 0 5 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:52.299
 atmospheres ie 142 atmospheres here 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.489
 me pascal initially ten right 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:03.939
 move 142 atmospheres plus 0 5 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:09.930
 atmospheres and 140 147 upper position not 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:15.010
 minus 137 bottom that is 137 147 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.519
 atmospheres are essentially regulated 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.040
 adjustment Astana well, now let's start 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.920
 check it out 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.990
 Well, actually check my 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.960
 grandfather 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.830
 such a booth I have here is my nozzle 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.000
 is attached 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.830
 we start looking right away we are what 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.180
 doing 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:46.850
 look at opened like this this time you 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:54.590
 do you want to be healthy and is not building 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:05:31.250
 spray should come fine the second is that 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:34.870
 we do we look pressure 120 125 a 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.020
 we have a 130-m lower means my nozzle 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.480
 need a little bit 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.160
 increase the pressure right now with this 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.160
 we are going 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:06:01.429
 good 100 110 2025 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:06.459
 Well, given that she is three years old I 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:06.459
 shot 100 very good result
