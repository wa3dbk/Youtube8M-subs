challenge for me I I will usually walk

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.009 
challenge for me I I will usually walk
around<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.549> instrument<00:02:46.090> as<00:02:46.269> it's<00:02:46.510> playing

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
around the instrument as it's playing

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.240 
around the instrument as it's playing
and<00:02:47.440> you'll<00:02:48.220> find<00:02:48.579> again<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:50.370> part<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.579> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and you'll find again a part of that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.089 
and you'll find again a part of that
geography<00:02:54.250> around<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.390> instrument<00:02:55.989> where<00:02:56.829> it

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
geography around the instrument where it

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.699 
geography around the instrument where it
has<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.549> delicious<00:02:58.209> sound<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.230> sound<00:02:59.530> that

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
has that delicious sound the sound that

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.750 
has that delicious sound the sound that
I<00:02:59.769> think<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:01.889> that's<00:03:02.889> the<00:03:03.130> optimum

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
I think is that's that's the optimum

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.199 
I think is that's that's the optimum
violin<00:03:04.389> sound<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:05.680> me<00:03:05.829> in<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:07.060> this

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
so in the course the conversation we'd

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.170 
so in the course the conversation we'd
all<00:04:01.140> mutually<00:04:01.530> agreed<00:04:02.040> let's<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.640> as<00:04:02.820> many

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
all mutually agreed let's get as many

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.260 
all mutually agreed let's get as many
samples<00:04:03.420> as<00:04:03.780> possible<00:04:04.230> he<00:04:04.970> allowed<00:04:05.970> us<00:04:06.000> to

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
samples as possible he allowed us to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.100 
samples as possible he allowed us to
sample<00:04:06.840> four<00:04:07.530> or<00:04:07.710> five<00:04:08.010> different<00:04:09.110> converters

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
sample four or five different converters

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.840 
sample four or five different converters
they<00:04:10.350> were<00:04:10.500> all<00:04:10.680> sent<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.010> us<00:04:11.220> without<00:04:11.550> any

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
they were all sent to us without any

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.000 
they were all sent to us without any
labeling<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.720> was<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.200> about<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.560> sound

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
labeling so it was just about the sound

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.160 
labeling so it was just about the sound
the<00:04:14.340> one<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.270> listening<00:04:15.660> experiment

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
the one that that listening experiment

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.690 
the one that that listening experiment
was<00:04:16.290> over<00:04:16.530> which<00:04:16.709> was<00:04:16.920> really<00:04:17.190> interesting

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
was over which was really interesting

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.670 
was over which was really interesting
because<00:04:17.790> there<00:04:18.090> big<00:04:18.600> difference<00:04:19.110> it<00:04:19.260> wasn't

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
because there big difference it wasn't

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.289 
because there big difference it wasn't
just<00:04:19.860> subtle<00:04:20.190> differences<00:04:20.580> big<00:04:20.850> differences

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
just subtle differences big differences

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.600 
just subtle differences big differences
between<00:04:21.480> them<00:04:21.810> we<00:04:22.770> picked<00:04:22.980> our<00:04:23.100> winner<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.490> we

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
between them we picked our winner and we

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.180 
between them we picked our winner and we
went<00:04:23.790> with<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.510> all<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:25.140> our<00:04:25.260> downloads

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
went with that so all of our downloads

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.380 
went with that so all of our downloads
are<00:04:27.090> done<00:04:27.360> through<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.920> D<00:04:29.390> converter

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
are done through that a to D converter

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.850 
are done through that a to D converter
the<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.140> transfers<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:33.860> the

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
the the transfers have this is the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.770 
the the transfers have this is the
spaciousness<00:04:35.550> about<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.750> just

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
spaciousness about it and they just

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.890 
spaciousness about it and they just
seemed<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.350> alive<00:04:37.500> they<00:04:38.400> were<00:04:38.660> much<00:04:39.660> better

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
seemed so alive they were much better

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.220 
seemed so alive they were much better
than<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.320> CDs<00:04:40.710> there's<00:04:41.310> no<00:04:41.820> no<00:04:42.450> comparison

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
than the CDs there's no no comparison

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.910 
than the CDs there's no no comparison
between<00:04:43.580> them<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.760> CDs<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:46.680> many

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
between them the CDs and in many

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.850 
between them the CDs and in many
instances<00:04:47.610> as<00:04:48.330> good<00:04:48.720> or<00:04:48.750> better<00:04:49.020> than<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.470> LP

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
instances as good or better than the LP

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.550 
instances as good or better than the LP
