00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.740
 my channel here from the gamer with a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.990
 White 2 game in mode 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.380
 sniper if you do not like 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.480
 shooters then you can perfectly 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.639
 listen to me since I'm going to talk about 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.970
 certain things so that you do not know 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 Sniper mode is a game every 45 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.770
 seconds 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.930
 this weapon change wii 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.620
 and you have to try to keep killing them 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.310
 to score points with weapons 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.110
 but that I like here or not now look 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.380
 I knew I knew what was coming was 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.300
 to get there they had little benefit 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.950
 because it's something because it's something if it was 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.620
 loading manias hobbies that I have good 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.590
 of cybele but you play shooter is that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.059
 I think there is no game mode or 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.360
 be a game a kind of game I walk 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.950
 I got to like it I like it 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 both the shooter sports 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.340
 independent games retro games 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.850

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.859

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.070
 I will not go down is that I have the hobby of 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.070
 crack 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.580
 how bad I am in this game mode 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 that like a long time ago that no 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.730
 play the black ops because I'm a little 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.770
 lost in what weapons are concerned 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.070
 because I always use a knife and little 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.720
 plus 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.610
 well that 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.440
 how lucky I was just my mother 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.960
 Beautiful holy love blessed by another 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.430

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.620
 fair of rubber ducks in short 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.850
 this city 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.369

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.370

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.370
 good that you give me with 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.780
 center 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.180
 I hate you finally matÃ­as one and I got excited 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.520
 for killing one 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.820
 or else another here is another 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.710
 another, although it's great, I'm going to have to 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.750
 stay a little bit more in everything to be 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.270
 quietly killing the change of 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.610
 weapons worth 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.900
 well what I said that I am to play a 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.270
 little to all types of games and for 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.620
 that's why you'll see me when I play 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.250
 having indie retro from platforms 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.550
 pokemon roll you're good so I already 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.940
 you understand everything, everything, everything until the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.310
 more absurd to those fears the game 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.560
 and is that I do not like to enjoy with 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.450
 all the possibilities offered by the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.100
 different types of games to you that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.820
 happens to you I know that there are always 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.770
 favorite games and such but I do not know what 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.360
 you think about the jonas theme and a couple of 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.780
 little things that I wanted to take advantage of and shits 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 and comments about yesterday did not go up 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.270
 videos you know I was a little 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.590
 pachucho and in 3 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.580
 and other things as 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.580
 more than a little impossible 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.760
 now crack 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.930
 the dead bad q roo pp 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.670
 here is not worth it is that I do not know if rajoy 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.470
 tell me the points here because there are 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.140
 another new one that does not count that what it does 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.769
 is to steal a death from the enemy or 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.769
 changed the weapon 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.780
 shit 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.549
 there the characters that are not 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.650
 have bald hairs remind me of 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.560
 the shaved ones remind me of hunters 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.879
 crocodiles I do not know why good that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 yesterday I could not upload video because I was 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.720
 malita and that the truth is that these 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.700
 days less since I have increased 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.459
 quite my level of demand in what 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.700
 refers to the videos that is something 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.640
 good at par 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.150
 bad to the extent that I am very 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.280
 demanding I'm demanding that but if 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.290
 you give him that I'm demanding so much from 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.040
 that after all I ended up giving 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.560
 mind that I have to give myself a little 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600
 of pressure above because of course I see 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.660
 so much for your part that I love them 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.060
 thank you so much, thank you very much 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.200
 fuck in what way can I return it 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.750
 Well, of course, making videos that 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.190
 have fun that all that but not always 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.050
 the videos come out the same there are others that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.340
 Some others are worse than others 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.009
 games that like more games than you 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.379
 they like less 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.710
 and I of course to that I add the fact of 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:46.169
 that I'm not a great sniper 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.930
 awful although you just saw that you can 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.370
 kill someone I'm not pressure to believe me 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.729
 with this I will not kill anything I will 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.729
 get lost 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.850
 why 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:06.370
 shit is worth it 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:10.050
 but I did not have a long sleeve but I did not 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.050
 it matters another thing to comment 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.300
 god headshot 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:21.070
 not all 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.940
 well finally the laws tremendous 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.470
 what 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.470
 in hit marker it's called that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:36.950
 after discovering borders in what was said 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.260
 at the end it is very relevant but 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.660
 this kind of videos before comes right 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.040
 to explore a little jump a little bit 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.570
 pressure on the and streaming is already in 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.640
 process that I activate it I'm going to 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.230
 can do without any problem 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.270
 thanks for watching my videos for being 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.470
 here for all messages of support are 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.800
 nice ones that I received because they have 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.090
 climbed a lot that you're the moral I'm 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.950
 that I do not have enough words to 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.010
 thank you crap one will 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.600
 continue do not forget you will continue 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.520
 there are two chapters to finish the 1 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.200
 then the 2 and I do not have much more than 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.600
 say that I'm rolling and the 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.330
 game already ended that really thanks 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.340
 for everything will come more games of 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.040
 fear they are going to keep it because I 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.630
 nor those things and whether I'm trying 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.370
 many games by the way a very 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.540
 important before I finish 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.940
 rolling and the video is much more 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.580
 long 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.270
 A friendly website has offered me the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.440
 made of a light bull doctor good he 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.050
 you are going to see an image we will do in 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.390
 screen of the game in question I need 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.420
 tell me you think it would be good for 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.880
 I can give you a tournament and such because 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.100
 a raffle is not a draw to draw it in 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.920
 the average twitter channel facebook I do not know 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.610
 or a competition in a game that everyone 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.280
 can you play 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.600
 give me ideas please in this channel 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.500
 that sounds like I do not want to do that and 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.420
 I have to think hard about how to do it 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.970
 because it is very simple good nothing more 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.510
 Thank you for everything it's worth to greetings and 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.800
 until next time 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.800
 here I was born goodbye
