00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:07.500
 dedicated especially for all 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:11.010
 who are beginning to guitar the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 who have never played a guitar 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.400
 who are curious to know how 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 play a guitar from the beginning 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.970
 from the most the most basic thing is 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 that you remember that if you already 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.640
 are advanced or have a medium level or 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.910
 advanced this video is not for you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 this video is only for those who 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.030
 they are starting from scratch 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.800
 and for those who are starting from scratch 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.400
 the discount that I'm going to make videos 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 progressive first let's go step by 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.100
 step you are going to start and you are going to go 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.100
 learning slowly but from a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.450
 sure way that over time you 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.330
 they will achieve mastery to play the guitar 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.030
 what I recommend is a lot of practice 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.570
 a lot of decision and a lot but a lot 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.150
 patience one of the first things that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.009
 we have to learn is to fine tune the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.630
 guitar they were once walked the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.270
 light guitar that they already have good 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.150
 heard at the beginning one does not have good hearing 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 to tune a guitar but what happens 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.060
 that now thanks to technology 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.250
 we have tuner is we have also 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.940
 we have in cell phones we can download 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 the tuner applications is for the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.259
 smartphone 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.479
 but it is more advisable to buy a 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.700
 tuner because these also come 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.610
 to avoid electric or also guitar 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.890
 electroacoustic have this entry that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.500
 you can connect directly if it is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.380
 that are in a noisy place if that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.170
 they are very loud on the phones 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.840
 they will not get it right but that's true 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.990
 because they are directly connected to 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 pick up of the instrument in this case of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.369
 the guitar on the strings the names 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.259
 of the ropes are the first block of 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.380
 I always mean the first string 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.049
 It is the first string it below the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.840
 finer this is called to me some 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.459
 They say the first is in this way 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.370
 wrong this is not the first the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:25.130
 first is this is she that block is 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.130
 thousand flame that in the tuner would be 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 would be 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.570
 and in English they tell him then 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.120
 we refine we search until full that the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.710
 from the center for example you can 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.620
 watch 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.690
 has an arrow that indicates to be these 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.150
 values you can get it in the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.350
 link below go to the link that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.690
 says lynn buy 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.540
 the tuner you can buy and go 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.120
 directly to the amazon.com store 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.050
 in this store is a very safe store 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.690
 you can buy it you can do what 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.000
 Any order that you want 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.400
 but this link is specifically 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.730
 to buy a good tuner that does not 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.460
 it costs more than 20 dollars and it's very, very 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.440
 but very useful and I use it everywhere 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.230
 the times that I'm going to play in a 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.030
 concert and it's all noisy then 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.970
 it's a bit difficult in the end I do not 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.790
 I want to be tuning on a stage and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.780
 then we fine-tune it with the plugin that 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.030
 has that the next string is the time 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.920
 the great shooter who is going to come sees 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.920
 then we call him yes 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.450
 that reaches the center also arrives 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.720
 you can see I'm going to focus a bit 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.720
 closer 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.780
 you can see the notes and there they are 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:11.090
 that is my second ship that is and the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:16.420
 third is sun that is that they think about the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.420
 center if the fourth israel 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.430
 Y 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.430
 is a little low then we're going to 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.130
 go up a little bit 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.149
 remember that while you are sounding 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.320
 they have to climb they do not have to turn off the 

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:38.620
 sound so they go up while 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.889
 it sounds 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.699
 can not go down 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.699
 or upload 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.849
 Y 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.510
 there they are 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.510
 now the fifth string is the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.850
 with the island 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.539
 get to the center 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.000
 when the strings are a little 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.690
 used a little old is a bit 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.690
 complicated 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.630
 at the end now the sixth string is my 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.750
 Hello 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:29.450
 like the first one but this one has two 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.450
 octaves more serious thicker 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.300
 i 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.690
 today we have 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.330
 I'm going 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.279
 that is the tuning thanks to the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.159
 technology now we can fine tune a 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:56.300
 guitar without any problem without any 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:58.460
 problem then 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.129
 that would be some of the basic things 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.879
 what we have to do to start 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.710
 play the guitar then the position the 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:09.680
 position 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.010
 varied in many ways but one of the 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.380
 most correct positions is to touch on the 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.790
 left leg on our leg 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.010
 left 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.180
 we open a little to the right and we sit 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:25.259
 Guitar 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.180
 and there are and there are people who do not like it 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.120
 makes them especially uncomfortable 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.980
 women can then do it in the 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.360
 right leg 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.360
 he does it on his right leg 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.910
 they do it without any problem in the 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.800
 right leg can also touch 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.110
 that's no problem too 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.570
 can cross their legs or touch a 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.130
 little uncomfortable crossing the legs that 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.390
 they are usually done when one already has 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:56.920
 practice is a little uncomfortable the beginning 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.920
 these positions completed 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.280
 and we already have this first step step 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.750
 basic now let's go to the second 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.360
 step remember that this is a video 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.729
 progressive that has to go through 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.370
 step I will do many many videos 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:16.060
 so do not worry that you 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.940
 is what happens in each video 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.020
 they have to go step by step with a 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.430
 little patience 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:26.500
 sometimes what I do is improvise everything 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.569
 what I do I'm improvising for 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.639
 do it faster and that's how 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:33.689
 any mistake that I have 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.269
 understand it because I'm improvising 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:38.669
 there are many billions of things that 

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:41.759
 I have in my head and that sometimes you 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.459
 confuse then have a bit of 

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:46.769
 patience let's go to the second video do 

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:50.849
 click on the next video and the box 

00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:55.159
 to buy the the tuner click 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:55.159
 down and we go to the second video
