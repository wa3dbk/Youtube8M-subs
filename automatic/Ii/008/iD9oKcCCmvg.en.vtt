00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
85 86 one is still a 98 that's not

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.880 
85 86 one is still a 98 that's not
enough<00:04:45.490> of<00:04:45.730> a<00:04:45.820> difference<00:04:46.180> 85<00:04:46.960> 86<00:04:47.380> Jordan

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
enough of a difference 85 86 Jordan

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.850 
enough of a difference 85 86 Jordan
although<00:04:48.220> really<00:04:48.520> good<00:04:48.760> was<00:04:49.210> not<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.540> 98<00:04:50.200> he<00:04:50.680> was

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
although really good was not a 98 he was

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.340 
although really good was not a 98 he was
a<00:04:50.890> 90<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.910> know<00:04:52.030> maybe<00:04:52.240> different<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.720> 90<00:04:53.170> you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
a 90 you know maybe different a 90 you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.800 
a 90 you know maybe different a 90 you
know<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:54.100> was<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.340> lot<00:04:54.760> of<00:04:55.120> difference<00:04:55.570> there

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
know it was a lot of difference there

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.180 
know it was a lot of difference there
and<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.350> think<00:04:56.410> that<00:04:56.680> that's<00:04:56.770> going<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.100> be

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
and I think that that's going to be

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.220 
and I think that that's going to be
reflected<00:04:57.700> this<00:04:57.790> year<00:04:58.060> because<00:04:58.360> again<00:04:58.690> the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
reflected this year because again the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.860 
reflected this year because again the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
strive to catch the goat I think that

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.120 
strive to catch the goat I think that
that<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.490> fantastic<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.990> remember<00:05:11.410> it's<00:05:11.620> not

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
that is fantastic so remember it's not

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.010 
that is fantastic so remember it's not
achieving<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:12.940> status<00:05:13.390> for<00:05:13.570> their<00:05:13.660> career

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
achieving that status for their career

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.780 
achieving that status for their career
but<00:05:14.440> how<00:05:14.590> they<00:05:14.740> compare<00:05:14.950> in<00:05:15.400> their<00:05:15.520> current

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
but how they compare in their current

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.090 
but how they compare in their current
age<00:05:16.060> or<00:05:16.360> form<00:05:16.690> so<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.350> lot<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.740> people<00:05:18.040> are

talking about cheese he was just using

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.690 
talking about cheese he was just using
the<00:05:25.720> example<00:05:26.020> of<00:05:26.260> watching<00:05:27.070> an<00:05:27.160> opponent<00:05:27.550> play

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700

example as far as lineups go you can't

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.460 
example as far as lineups go you can't
just<00:05:45.700> put<00:05:45.940> LeBron<00:05:46.150> James<00:05:46.810> at<00:05:47.050> point<00:05:47.380> guard

just put LeBron James at point guard

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.320 
just put LeBron James at point guard
anymore<00:05:47.980> and<00:05:48.400> that<00:05:48.580> was<00:05:48.760> one<00:05:48.940> of<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.120> big

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
anymore and that was one of the big

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.960 
anymore and that was one of the big
things<00:05:49.540> for<00:05:49.810> me<00:05:49.990> because<00:05:50.980> of<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.250> specialty

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
things for me because of the specialty

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.800 
things for me because of the specialty
of<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:53.320> positions<00:05:53.980> and<00:05:54.190> what<00:05:54.700> they<00:05:54.850> do<00:05:54.910> since

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
of the positions and what they do since

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.360 
of the positions and what they do since
you're<00:05:55.990> not<00:05:56.110> going<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.320> have<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.530> bunch<00:05:56.770> of<00:05:56.860> 99<00:05:57.250> s

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
you're not going to have a bunch of 99 s

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.970 
you're not going to have a bunch of 99 s
running<00:05:57.640> all<00:05:57.730> over<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:57.970> place<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.830> lot<00:05:59.830> of

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
running all over the place a lot of

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980 
running all over the place a lot of
times<00:06:00.220> it's<00:06:00.580> going<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.000> be<00:06:01.120> better<00:06:01.390> that's

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
times it's going to be better that's

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.650 
times it's going to be better that's
what<00:06:02.230> I<00:06:02.260> think<00:06:02.650> so<00:06:03.280> with<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.000> authenticity<00:06:04.630> of

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
what I think so with the authenticity of

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.590 
what I think so with the authenticity of
the<00:06:05.410> ratings<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.980> player<00:06:06.190> authenticity<00:06:06.730> it's

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
the ratings to player authenticity it's

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.020 
the ratings to player authenticity it's
very<00:06:07.810> important<00:06:08.410> they<00:06:08.710> use<00:06:08.890> James<00:06:09.280> Harden<00:06:09.850> as

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
very important they use James Harden as

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.760 
very important they use James Harden as
an<00:06:10.150> example<00:06:10.480> he's<00:06:10.780> going<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:10.990> have<00:06:11.230> an<00:06:11.380> NBA

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
an example he's going to have an NBA

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.460 
an example he's going to have an NBA
leading<00:06:12.250> 95<00:06:12.970> draw<00:06:13.360> foul<00:06:13.810> rating<00:06:14.169> to<00:06:14.260> get<00:06:14.380> to

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
leading 95 draw foul rating to get to

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.290 
leading 95 draw foul rating to get to
the<00:06:14.560> free-throw<00:06:14.800> line<00:06:15.010> for<00:06:15.400> easy<00:06:15.850> two<00:06:16.090> points

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
the free-throw line for easy two points

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.390 
the free-throw line for easy two points
so<00:06:16.900> what<00:06:17.050> does<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.169> mean<00:06:17.440> harden<00:06:18.130> is<00:06:18.220> really

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
so what does that mean harden is really

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.310 
so what does that mean harden is really
good<00:06:18.520> at<00:06:18.640> drawing<00:06:18.820> fouls<00:06:19.180> so<00:06:19.750> if<00:06:19.870> you<00:06:19.990> play

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
good at drawing fouls so if you play

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.380 
good at drawing fouls so if you play
with<00:06:20.740> harden<00:06:21.190> like<00:06:21.640> he<00:06:21.850> was<00:06:21.970> meant<00:06:22.210> to<00:06:22.360> be

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
with harden like he was meant to be

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.180 
with harden like he was meant to be
played<00:06:22.510> which<00:06:23.320> is<00:06:23.470> to<00:06:23.590> get<00:06:23.710> to<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:23.890> line<00:06:24.040> and

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
played which is to get to the line and

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.650 
played which is to get to the line and
draw<00:06:24.310> fouls<00:06:24.610> instead<00:06:25.090> of<00:06:25.180> going<00:06:25.450> for<00:06:25.630> a

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
draw fouls instead of going for a

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.960 
draw fouls instead of going for a
mid-range<00:06:26.020> jumper<00:06:26.530> you<00:06:27.310> will<00:06:27.490> have<00:06:27.700> better

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
mid-range jumper you will have better

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.630 
mid-range jumper you will have better
success<00:06:28.300> with<00:06:28.780> him<00:06:28.930> so<00:06:29.500> nobody<00:06:30.250> can<00:06:30.430> put

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
success with him so nobody can put

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.120 
success with him so nobody can put
LeBron<00:06:30.790> James<00:06:31.210> at<00:06:31.390> point<00:06:31.600> guard<00:06:31.690> or<00:06:32.200> Michael
