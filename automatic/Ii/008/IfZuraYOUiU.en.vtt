last year this is where I get me sell it
earlier<00:00:52.910> let's<00:00:53.910> weigh<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.239> touching<00:00:54.690> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.280 

so<00:01:11.470> there<00:01:11.619> she<00:01:11.770> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so there she is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.540 
so there she is
it's<00:01:14.290> definitely<00:01:14.470> heavier<00:01:14.860> than<00:01:14.979> last<00:01:15.100> year<00:01:15.430> I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
it's definitely heavier than last year I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.749 
it's definitely heavier than last year I
reckon<00:01:15.909> that<00:01:15.940> I<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:18.460> know<00:01:18.610> it's

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
reckon that I don't know it's

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.060 
reckon that I don't know it's
guesstimated<00:01:19.479> about<00:01:19.690> 55<00:01:20.590> either<00:01:20.890> works<00:01:23.070> good

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
guesstimated about 55 either works good

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.070 
guesstimated about 55 either works good
60<00:01:24.490> pound<00:01:24.729> so<00:01:25.300> we'll<00:01:25.420> ever<00:01:25.540> go<00:01:25.720> up<00:01:25.750> measuring
