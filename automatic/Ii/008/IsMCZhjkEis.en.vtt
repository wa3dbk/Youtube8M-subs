to<00:00:23.730> other<00:00:23.910> events<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:24.930> wanted

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
to other events and I think we wanted

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
to other events and I think we wanted
more<00:00:25.470> people<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.490> lot<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> teams<00:00:27.150> assume<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
more people a lot of teams assume that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.150 
more people a lot of teams assume that
we<00:00:27.720> were<00:00:27.840> only<00:00:27.930> dominant<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.710> about<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> month

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
we were only dominant for about a month

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.400 
we were only dominant for about a month
of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> game<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.359> came<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of the game so we came here with the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.840 
of the game so we came here with the
mindset<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.949> prove<00:00:32.160> other<00:00:32.399> people<00:00:32.640> wrong

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
mindset to prove other people wrong

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.660 
mindset to prove other people wrong
basically<00:00:33.750> making<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.710> statement<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
basically making a statement we are the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.660 
basically making a statement we are the
best<00:00:36.059> black<00:00:36.329> ops<00:00:36.570> 2<00:00:36.780> team<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.649> world<00:00:37.829> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
forth I think they're gonna be a force

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.679 
forth I think they're gonna be a force
to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.670> reckoned<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:18.030> especially<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to be reckoned with especially in the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
hard points if they can you know get the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
hard points if they can you know get the
momentum<00:01:21.210> they're<00:01:21.930> gonna<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.229> such<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> hard

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
momentum they're gonna be such a hard

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
momentum they're gonna be such a hard
team<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.189> beat<00:01:23.869> what<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.110> I

team to beat what do you think I
strongest<00:01:25.590> points<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> mean<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.220> example<00:01:26.250> say

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
strongest points I mean for example say

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
strongest points I mean for example say
you<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:27.240> scoop<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.450> against<00:01:27.720> epsilon<00:01:28.080> R

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you would scoop up against epsilon R

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
blind spots open on the map so it pretty

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.420 
blind spots open on the map so it pretty
much<00:02:03.540> works<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.990> every<00:02:04.320> team<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.159> trade

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
much works with every team if you trade

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.950 
much works with every team if you trade
effectively<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.750> plan<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
effectively and that's what we plan to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.300 
effectively and that's what we plan to
do<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.290> anything<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.890> play<00:02:08.099> epsilon<00:02:08.670> opt

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
do with anything we play epsilon opt

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.490 
do with anything we play epsilon opt
complexity<00:02:10.209> any<00:02:10.360> team<00:02:10.599> we<00:02:10.690> plays<00:02:10.899> pretty<00:02:11.349> much

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
complexity any team we plays pretty much

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650 
complexity any team we plays pretty much
the<00:02:11.590> same<00:02:11.739> strategy<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:13.120> any<00:02:13.360> team<00:02:13.630> you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
the same strategy is to any team you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.070 
the same strategy is to any team you
wouldn't<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> face<00:02:14.470> really<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:15.060> Absalon

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080

really<00:02:17.080> probably<00:02:17.500> end<00:02:17.680> up<00:02:17.739> facing<00:02:17.950> them<00:02:18.190> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
really probably end up facing them you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.040 
really probably end up facing them you
know<00:02:18.730> early<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.569> want<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> play<00:02:19.930> them

later when it's like the intensity of
the<00:02:22.060> key<00:02:22.330> events<00:02:22.630> built<00:02:22.840> up<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.380> know

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the key events built up and you know

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.170 
the key events built up and you know
it's<00:02:23.680> like<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.400> kind<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> getting<00:02:24.849> those

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
it's like it's kind of getting those

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.850 
it's like it's kind of getting those
like<00:02:25.360> boiling<00:02:25.630> points<00:02:26.200> i<00:02:26.260> want<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.500> i<00:02:26.530> can't

wait<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.040> those<00:02:27.280> moments<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.420> really

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
wait for those moments but we really

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.990 
wait for those moments but we really
want<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> play<00:02:28.989> epsilon<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:30.250> hopefully<00:02:30.640> not

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
want to play epsilon just hopefully not
