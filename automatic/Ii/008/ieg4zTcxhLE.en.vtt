cabinetmakers have always had a bit of a
raw<00:00:04.080> deal<00:00:04.110> when<00:00:04.560> it<00:00:04.650> comes<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.069> squares

these as these twos are quite nicely
balanced<00:00:10.349> but<00:00:11.099> they're<00:00:11.219> very<00:00:11.400> chunky<00:00:11.700> and

they're<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.840> very<00:00:13.080> accurate<00:00:13.280> I'll<00:00:14.280> show<00:00:14.639> you

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
they're not very accurate I'll show you

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.519 
they're not very accurate I'll show you

see the accuracy or the inaccuracy of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.590 
see the accuracy or the inaccuracy of
the<00:00:43.880> square<00:00:44.240> is<00:00:45.250> doubled<00:00:46.250> by<00:00:46.880> coming<00:00:47.270> in<00:00:47.390> from

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
the square is doubled by coming in from

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.930 
the square is doubled by coming in from
one<00:00:47.630> side<00:00:48.080> and<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.410> other<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:49.520> can<00:00:49.550> quite

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
one side and the other and you can quite

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.510 
one side and the other and you can quite
clearly<00:00:49.970> see<00:00:50.420> there<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:51.110> this<00:00:51.740> is<00:00:51.980> not

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
clearly see there that this is not

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.440 
clearly see there that this is not
accurate<00:00:52.700> enough<00:00:53.210> for<00:00:53.270> fine<00:00:53.660> work<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:55.730> it's

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
accurate enough for fine work so it's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.470 
accurate enough for fine work so it's
hardly<00:00:56.809> any<00:00:57.260> surprise<00:00:57.860> that<00:00:58.480> woodworkers

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
hardly any surprise that woodworkers

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.610 
hardly any surprise that woodworkers
have<00:00:59.870> embraced<00:01:00.730> engineering<00:01:01.730> squares

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
have embraced engineering squares

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.360 
have embraced engineering squares
they're<00:01:03.620> much<00:01:04.280> nicer<00:01:05.270> size<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.190> they<00:01:07.190> are

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
they're much nicer size and they are

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:18.770 
they're much nicer size and they are
very<00:01:07.760> accurate<00:01:08.000> indeed

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.109 

so<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.869> can<00:01:20.020> see<00:01:20.229> there<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.770> couple<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.880> dead

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
so you can see there a couple of dead

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.740 
so you can see there a couple of dead
parallel<00:01:22.570> lines<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:25.000> disadvantage<00:01:25.720> with

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
parallel lines the disadvantage with

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.109 
parallel lines the disadvantage with
these<00:01:26.110> squares<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.829> that<00:01:27.310> they're<00:01:27.610> very

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
these squares is that they're very

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.990 
these squares is that they're very
unbalanced<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:30.369> if<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:30.700> happen<00:01:30.939> to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
unbalanced and also if you happen to

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.029 
unbalanced and also if you happen to
drop<00:01:31.240> one<00:01:31.450> on<00:01:31.539> a<00:01:31.570> concrete<00:01:31.960> floor<00:01:32.110> they're<00:01:32.890> no

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
drop one on a concrete floor they're no

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.609 
drop one on a concrete floor they're no
longer<00:01:33.220> square<00:01:33.670> anymore<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:35.259> what<00:01:35.439> I've<00:01:35.590> tried

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
longer square anymore so what I've tried

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.990 
longer square anymore so what I've tried
to<00:01:36.070> do<00:01:36.429> is<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:37.000> take<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.740> benefits<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
to do is to take the the benefits of the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.719 
to do is to take the the benefits of the
engineering<00:01:40.509> square<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:42.009> balance<00:01:42.429> of

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
engineering square and the balance of

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.080 
engineering square and the balance of
the<00:01:43.390> woodworking<00:01:43.750> square<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.649> come<00:01:45.610> out<00:01:45.789> with

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
the woodworking square and come out with

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.850 
the woodworking square and come out with
what<00:01:46.420> I'd<00:01:46.570> call<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.020> my<00:01:47.170> cabinet<00:01:47.649> making

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
what I'd call it my cabinet making

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.350 
what I'd call it my cabinet making
squares<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.490> I've<00:01:51.580> got<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:51.759> pair<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.060> these

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
squares so I've got a pair of these

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.840 
squares so I've got a pair of these
squares<00:01:52.720> first<00:01:53.530> one<00:01:53.799> here<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> five<00:01:54.610> inch

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
squares first one here is the five inch

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.080 
squares first one here is the five inch
and<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.810> five<00:01:56.020> inch<00:01:56.259> dimension<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:57.189> measures

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
and the five inch dimension it measures

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.749 
and the five inch dimension it measures
on<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.390> inside<00:01:58.929> here<00:01:59.580> that's<00:02:00.580> a

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
on the inside here that's a

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.559 
on the inside here that's a
general-purpose<00:02:01.270> cabinetmaking<00:02:02.049> square<00:02:02.560> and

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
general-purpose cabinetmaking square and

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.120 
general-purpose cabinetmaking square and
then<00:02:04.569> there's<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.110> dinky<00:02:05.409> little<00:02:05.560> three<00:02:05.950> inch

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
then there's the dinky little three inch

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.770 
then there's the dinky little three inch
which<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:07.479> very<00:02:08.049> useful<00:02:08.289> little<00:02:08.769> square<00:02:09.780> now

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
which is a very useful little square now

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.780 
which is a very useful little square now
they<00:02:10.929> have<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> number<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.500> features<00:02:11.799> they've

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
they have a number of features they've

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.809 
they have a number of features they've
there<00:02:13.180> they're<00:02:13.450> really<00:02:13.690> nicely<00:02:13.900> balanced<00:02:14.819> if

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
there they're really nicely balanced if

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.080 
there they're really nicely balanced if
you<00:02:16.510> were<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.720> sit<00:02:16.930> these<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.530> edge<00:02:17.650> here

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
you were to sit these on the edge here

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.030 
you were to sit these on the edge here
they<00:02:19.090> sit<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.510> their<00:02:19.690> own<00:02:19.720> both<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.650> them<00:02:20.799> quite

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
they sit on their own both of them quite

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.069 
they sit on their own both of them quite
happily<00:02:21.480> try<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.600> do<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> with<00:02:22.989> an

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
happily try and do that with an

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.720 
happily try and do that with an
engineering<00:02:23.530> square<00:02:23.980> it'll<00:02:24.160> be<00:02:24.310> straight<00:02:24.549> on

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
engineering square it'll be straight on

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.880 
engineering square it'll be straight on
the<00:02:24.850> floor<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.959> there's<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.170> nice<00:02:26.320> balance<00:02:26.590> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the floor so there's a nice balance to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.090 
the floor so there's a nice balance to
them<00:02:27.160> there's<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.910> nice<00:02:28.090> size<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.750> them<00:02:29.100> they're

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
them there's a nice size to them they're

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.910 
them there's a nice size to them they're
both<00:02:30.340> dead<00:02:30.970> accurate<00:02:31.260> accurate<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> point

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
both dead accurate accurate to a point

you happen to drop it on the floor might

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.860 
you happen to drop it on the floor might
get<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.220> nick<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:55.299> it's<00:02:55.450> going<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.630> stay

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
get a little nick but it's going to stay

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.430 
get a little nick but it's going to stay
dead<00:02:56.109> accurate<00:02:56.290> as<00:02:56.769> well<00:02:58.200> another<00:02:59.200> little

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
dead accurate as well another little

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.629 
dead accurate as well another little

you're not you're not looking to give
this<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.370> edge<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.799> square

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
this the the edge of the of the square

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.009 
this the the edge of the of the square
support<00:03:15.639> it's<00:03:15.880> actually<00:03:16.239> got<00:03:16.389> support<00:03:16.750> built

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
support it's actually got support built

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.110 
support it's actually got support built
in<00:03:17.230> which<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.560> really<00:03:17.859> nice<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:18.850> you're<00:03:19.000> able

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
in which is really nice so you're able

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.229 
in which is really nice so you're able
to

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
to

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.559 
to
support<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.590> support<00:03:26.159> that<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.609> so

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
support that and support that there so

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.360 
support that and support that there so
that<00:03:27.750> works<00:03:27.989> really<00:03:28.290> well<00:03:28.409> particularly<00:03:29.219> when

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
that works really well particularly when

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.959 
that works really well particularly when
you're<00:03:29.609> coming<00:03:29.969> down<00:03:31.400> when<00:03:32.400> you're<00:03:32.549> marking

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:32.969 
you're coming down when you're marking

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:34.550 
you're coming down when you're marking
down<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:33.450> dovetails<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.109> things<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
down for dovetails and things like that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.449 
down for dovetails and things like that
sits<00:03:35.010> there<00:03:35.099> very<00:03:35.430> nicely<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:37.889> then<00:03:38.189> the<00:03:38.280> last

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
sits there very nicely and then the last

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.190 
sits there very nicely and then the last
little<00:03:38.639> feature<00:03:39.000> which<00:03:39.239> I've<00:03:39.420> incorporated

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
little feature which I've incorporated

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.440 
little feature which I've incorporated
as<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.129> see<00:03:41.370> it's<00:03:41.700> got<00:03:41.969> a<00:03:42.000> little<00:03:42.239> notch

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
as you can see it's got a little notch

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.069 
as you can see it's got a little notch
here<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.739> when<00:03:44.010> you're<00:03:44.420> doing<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.810> outside

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
here so when you're doing the outside

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.069 
here so when you're doing the outside
measurements<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.420> pieces<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.540> timber<00:03:48.750> for

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
measurements of pieces of timber for

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.069 
measurements of pieces of timber for
instance<00:03:49.379> very<00:03:49.680> often<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.519> get<00:03:50.730> fur<00:03:51.720> and

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
instance very often you get fur and

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.250 
instance very often you get fur and
things<00:03:52.319> there<00:03:52.939> which<00:03:53.939> throws<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.900> throw<00:03:55.109> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
things there which throws can throw the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.199 
things there which throws can throw the
square<00:03:55.560> off<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.280> by<00:03:56.430> having<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.730> little<00:03:57.030> notch

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
square off so by having a little notch

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.099 
square off so by having a little notch
in<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.540> corner

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
in the corner

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.619 
in the corner
allows<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.040> easily<00:03:59.419> reference<00:04:00.419> the

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
allows you to easily reference the

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.770 
allows you to easily reference the
outside<00:04:01.049> there<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:03.590> there<00:04:04.590> we<00:04:04.709> have<00:04:04.859> it

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
outside there so there we have it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.809 
outside there so there we have it
my<00:04:06.780> little<00:04:07.139> pair<00:04:07.439> of<00:04:07.469> cabinet<00:04:08.069> making<00:04:08.250> squares

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
my little pair of cabinet making squares

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.399
