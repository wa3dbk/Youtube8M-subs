okay that was my problem here as you can

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.590 
okay that was my problem here as you can
see<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:16.310> couldn't<00:01:16.670> get<00:01:16.789> all<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.240> way<00:01:17.359> under

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
see it couldn't get all the way under

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.450 
see it couldn't get all the way under
the<00:01:17.719> seats<00:01:18.020> there's<00:01:18.320> still<00:01:18.560> some<00:01:18.859> junk<00:01:19.159> there

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
the seats there's still some junk there

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.849 
the seats there's still some junk there
I<00:01:19.729> got<00:01:20.000> most<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.630> though<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.140> would<00:01:21.439> like<00:01:21.679> it

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
I got most of it though I would like it

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.200 
I got most of it though I would like it
better<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.159> it<00:01:22.340> would<00:01:22.460> get<00:01:22.579> all<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.850> way<00:01:22.939> under

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
better if it would get all the way under

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.490 
better if it would get all the way under
but<00:01:23.359> I<00:01:23.420> guess<00:01:23.600> I'll<00:01:23.780> hop<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.049> use<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.319> hose

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
but I guess I'll hop to use the hose

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.919 
but I guess I'll hop to use the hose
when<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.549> use<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.909> holes<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.479> leave<00:01:26.659> some

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
when you use the holes you leave some

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.969 
when you use the holes you leave some
suction<00:01:28.659> all<00:01:29.659> right<00:01:29.959> let's<00:01:30.259> try<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:30.619> here<00:01:30.860> on

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
suction all right let's try it here on

00:01:30.979 --> 00:02:36.530 
suction all right let's try it here on
the<00:01:31.009> carpet

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.030 

so<00:02:37.530> pretty<00:02:37.890> good<00:02:37.950> actually<00:02:38.579> I<00:02:38.939> find<00:02:39.680> some<00:02:40.680> sand

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so pretty good actually I find some sand

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.720 
so pretty good actually I find some sand
in<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:41.430> car<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.409> when<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.829> this<00:02:44.489> little

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
attachment here it actually helps to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.240 
attachment here it actually helps to
break<00:02:48.180> up<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.599> sand<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.079> bit<00:02:49.230> better<00:02:49.469> I'll<00:02:50.099> show

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
break up the sand a bit better I'll show

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.509 
break up the sand a bit better I'll show

that's how you dump it again there's a
different<00:03:12.689> angle<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.019> want<00:03:13.049> some<00:03:13.470> wacky

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
different angle you want some wacky

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
