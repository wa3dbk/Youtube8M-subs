00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.479 
get anything on the zero speed sensor
you<00:00:44.379> don't<00:00:44.559> want<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.739> break<00:00:44.949> it<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.220> know<00:00:45.309> want

as you tighten these hub bolts the three

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.129 
as you tighten these hub bolts the three
in<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.320> back<00:04:24.419> should<00:04:25.419> do<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.660> little<00:04:25.810> bit<00:04:25.990> at<00:04:26.080> a

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
in the back should do a little bit at a

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.700 
in the back should do a little bit at a
time<00:04:27.060> around<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.210> circle<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:28.630> pushes<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.590> and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
time around the circle so pushes it and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.950 
time around the circle so pushes it and
if<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:29.950> tighten<00:04:30.160> one<00:04:30.490> end<00:04:30.730> it's<00:04:31.510> gonna<00:04:31.660> be<00:04:31.840> on

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
if you tighten one end it's gonna be on

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.420 
if you tighten one end it's gonna be on
an<00:04:32.080> angle<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.830> won't<00:04:33.010> be<00:04:33.130> able<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.310> get

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
an angle and you won't be able to get

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.270 
an angle and you won't be able to get
the<00:04:33.550> other<00:04:33.580> two<00:04:33.790> in<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:35.800> go<00:04:35.919> right<00:04:36.100> in<00:04:36.250> a

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
the other two in you go right in a

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.430 
the other two in you go right in a
circle<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:40.090> -<00:04:40.270> uh<00:04:40.300> well<00:04:40.870> do<00:04:40.990> different<00:04:41.290> for

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
circle that - uh well do different for

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.870 
circle that - uh well do different for
when<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.620> put<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.800> tire<00:04:42.070> on<00:04:42.100> with<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.490> lug<00:04:42.639> nuts

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
when you put a tire on with the lug nuts

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.290 
when you put a tire on with the lug nuts
just<00:04:43.060> kind<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.360> going<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.440> order<00:04:45.120> really<00:04:46.120> get

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
just kind of going to order really get

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.530 
just kind of going to order really get
snug<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.900> go<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.139> next<00:04:47.320> one
