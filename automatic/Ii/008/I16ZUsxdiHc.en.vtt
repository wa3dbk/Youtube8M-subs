00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
fairly difficult but if you manage to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
fairly difficult but if you manage to
kill<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> probes<00:00:49.250> consistently<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
kill the probes consistently and you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430

have<00:00:51.000> lots<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> hearts<00:00:51.570> dropping<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
have lots of hearts dropping then it is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

I have died a few times trying this vibe

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.890 
I have died a few times trying this vibe
also<00:03:04.800> i<00:03:05.040> also<00:03:05.370> managed<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.790> do<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.060> before<00:03:06.330> and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
also i also managed to do it before and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.250 
also i also managed to do it before and
then<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.530> realized<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.820> was<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.390> recording
