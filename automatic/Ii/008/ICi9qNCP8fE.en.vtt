00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
final stages of development so we should

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950 
final stages of development so we should
be<00:00:17.279> seeing<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.580> pretty<00:00:17.789> big<00:00:17.970> patch<00:00:18.210> from<00:00:18.810> the

in the loop with what's going on with
Battlefield<00:00:33.989> games<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.500> mean<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.950> compare

Battlefield games I mean if you compare

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
Battlefield games I mean if you compare
to<00:00:35.370> say<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> battlefield<00:00:36.239> 3<00:00:36.540> lifespan<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
to say the battlefield 3 lifespan this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.900 
to say the battlefield 3 lifespan this
has<00:00:37.440> been<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:37.920> better<00:00:38.160> experience<00:00:38.219> in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
has been a much better experience in

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
has been a much better experience in
terms<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.329> knowing<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> devs<00:00:40.559> are

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
terms of knowing what the devs are

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
terms of knowing what the devs are
currently<00:00:41.100> working<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.670> being<00:00:41.940> able<00:00:42.270> to

currently working on being able to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.270 
currently working on being able to
experience<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.140> ahead<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
experience it ahead of time so you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.500 
experience it ahead of time so you
actually<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.820> what's<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
what's going on it's just great being

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.840 
what's going on it's just great being
kept<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.860> loop<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.340> good<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
kept in the loop it's good for the

it actually comes out now what I'd like
to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.440> give<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> kind<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> blanket

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to do is give you kind of a blanket

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
to do is give you kind of a blanket
statement<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.300> some<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> cooler<00:01:01.050> things

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
can expect in the next patch and then

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.670 
can expect in the next patch and then
also<00:01:06.390> talk<00:01:06.689> about<00:01:06.720> some<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.439> most

influential changes that they're making

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
influential changes that they're making
one<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.049> has<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> damage<00:01:11.130> model

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
one that has to do with the damage model

one that has to do with the damage model
on<00:01:11.610> most<00:01:12.119> weapons<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> cool<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
on most weapons now a cool thing that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.960 
on most weapons now a cool thing that
they're<00:01:13.920> working<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.939> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
they're working on right now which is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
they're working on right now which is
really<00:01:15.420> essential<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> game<00:01:16.530> itself<00:01:16.860> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
really essential to the game itself is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.760 
really essential to the game itself is
creating<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.090> skill-based<00:01:18.570> team<00:01:19.140> balancer

creating a skill-based team balancer

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
creating a skill-based team balancer
that<00:01:19.950> considers<00:01:20.369> squads<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> friends<00:01:21.810> and

that considers squads and friends and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
that considers squads and friends and
minimizes<00:01:22.530> lopsided<00:01:23.189> games<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.610> our<00:01:24.030> most

minimizes lopsided games in our most
popular<00:01:24.570> game<00:01:25.200> modes<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.680> think<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> definitely

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
popular game modes I think we definitely

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
popular game modes I think we definitely
all<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:27.030> experiences<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.960> playing

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
all have experiences of playing

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
all have experiences of playing
battlefield<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> lopsided<00:01:29.400> team<00:01:30.060> where<00:01:30.420> all

battlefield on a lopsided team where all

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.450 
battlefield on a lopsided team where all
the<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.110> players<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.560> flock<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.250> team

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the good players just flock to one team

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
the good players just flock to one team
I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.030> understand<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.869> concept

makes<00:01:44.310> no<00:01:44.399> sense<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> me<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.810> weird<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
makes no sense to me it's so weird and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.929 
makes no sense to me it's so weird and
it's<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.920> annoying<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.759> especially

high ranking players I'll try and switch
to<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.909> team<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.570> alas<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.350> more

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
to one team but alas that's really more

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
to one team but alas that's really more
of<00:01:52.590> an<00:01:52.680> issue<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> human<00:01:53.520> condition<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
of an issue with the human condition in

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
of an issue with the human condition in
not<00:01:54.390> battlefield<00:01:55.079> itself<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.829> rather<00:01:56.070> than

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
not battlefield itself so rather than

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.670 
not battlefield itself so rather than
trying<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> fix<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> human<00:01:57.780> condition<00:01:57.990> they

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
trying to fix the human condition they

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
trying to fix the human condition they
will<00:01:58.890> put<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.430> auto<00:01:59.700> team<00:02:00.060> balancer<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
will put in a auto team balancer that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.359 
will put in a auto team balancer that
hopefully<00:02:01.170> does<00:02:01.350> everything<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.040> want

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
hopefully does everything that we want

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.830 
hopefully does everything that we want
it<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.210> something<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it to do and this is something that I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.569 
it to do and this is something that I
think<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.350> do<00:02:04.409> properly<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
think if they do properly and

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.100 
think if they do properly and
everybody's<00:02:06.210> happy<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:06.960> can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
everybody's happy with it they can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
everybody's happy with it they can
implement<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.770> system<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.520> subsequent

latest<00:03:05.349> CTE<00:03:05.709> changes<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.700> really<00:03:07.000> made<00:03:07.150> a

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
latest CTE changes have really made a

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.699 
latest CTE changes have really made a
lot<00:03:07.599> of<00:03:07.630> improvements<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.440> they're<00:03:08.530> even

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
lot of improvements and they're even

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.039 
lot of improvements and they're even
experimenting<00:03:09.610> with<00:03:09.640> 60<00:03:10.180> tick<00:03:10.420> rate<00:03:10.660> servers

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
experimenting with 60 tick rate servers

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.240 
experimenting with 60 tick rate servers
and<00:03:11.910> 120<00:03:12.910> Hertz<00:03:13.360> servers<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.260> 120<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:14.950> really

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
and 120 Hertz servers and 120 is really

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.680 
and 120 Hertz servers and 120 is really
the<00:03:15.370> gold<00:03:15.610> standard<00:03:15.880> when<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.269> comes<00:03:16.360> to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
the gold standard when it comes to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.360 
the gold standard when it comes to
competitive<00:03:17.320> shooters<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:17.829> they<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.130> pull

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
competitive shooters if they can pull

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.789 
competitive shooters if they can pull
this<00:03:18.549> off<00:03:18.760> consistently<00:03:19.630> then<00:03:20.200> they're<00:03:20.650> going

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
this off consistently then they're going

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.170 
this off consistently then they're going
to<00:03:20.859> be<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> market<00:03:21.280> competing<00:03:21.910> with

just how snappy and responsive their net
code<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.220> that'll<00:03:27.549> be<00:03:27.670> amazing<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.269> they

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
code is and that'll be amazing if they

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.539

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.860 
can actually pull it off but that is
certainly<00:03:30.880> not<00:03:31.060> coming<00:03:31.359> out<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.690> spring

to<00:03:55.269> work<00:03:55.420> towards<00:03:55.840> those<00:03:56.019> now<00:03:56.410> let's<00:03:56.590> talk<00:03:56.739> a

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
to work towards those now let's talk a

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.110 
to work towards those now let's talk a
little<00:03:56.859> bit<00:03:57.190> about<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.549> weapon<00:03:57.910> damage

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
little bit about the weapon damage

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.879 
little bit about the weapon damage
tweaking<00:03:58.780> that's<00:03:58.959> going<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.260> affect<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.709> game

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
tweaking that's going to affect the game

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.979 
tweaking that's going to affect the game
fairly<00:04:00.220> drastically<00:04:01.060> first<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.720> all<00:04:01.840> they're

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
fairly drastically first of all they're

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.660 
fairly drastically first of all they're
changing<00:04:02.319> up<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> suppression<00:04:02.920> system<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.489> bit

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
changing up the suppression system a bit

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.490 
changing up the suppression system a bit
so<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:03.910> suppression<00:04:04.720> will<00:04:04.989> actually<00:04:05.319> not

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
so that suppression will actually not

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.229 
so that suppression will actually not
affect<00:04:05.889> players<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.549> are<00:04:06.639> in<00:04:06.670> close<00:04:07.030> range

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
affect players that are in close range

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.240 
affect players that are in close range
to<00:04:07.660> somebody<00:04:07.989> else<00:04:08.139> shooting<00:04:08.560> at<00:04:08.739> them<00:04:08.950> so

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
to somebody else shooting at them so

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.460 
to somebody else shooting at them so
basically<00:04:10.060> your<00:04:10.239> suppression<00:04:10.780> takes<00:04:11.049> into

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
basically your suppression takes into

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.770 
basically your suppression takes into
effect<00:04:11.829> once<00:04:12.310> your<00:04:12.489> gun<00:04:12.730> has<00:04:12.940> hit<00:04:13.120> its<00:04:13.239> maximum

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
effect once your gun has hit its maximum

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.259 
effect once your gun has hit its maximum
damage<00:04:14.019> drop-off<00:04:14.709> multiplier<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:16.060> at<00:04:16.209> that

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
damage drop-off multiplier and at that

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.789 
damage drop-off multiplier and at that
point<00:04:16.600> it'll<00:04:16.870> start<00:04:17.139> suppressing<00:04:17.410> its

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
point it'll start suppressing its

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.349 
point it'll start suppressing its
targets<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.489> basically<00:04:18.669> means<00:04:19.000> that

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
targets so this basically means that

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.430 
targets so this basically means that
you're<00:04:19.479> not<00:04:19.510> going<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.870> affecting<00:04:20.350> your

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
you're not going to be affecting your

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.320 
you're not going to be affecting your
opponent's<00:04:20.859> accuracy<00:04:21.370> if<00:04:21.729> you're<00:04:21.880> in<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> close

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
opponent's accuracy if you're in a close

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.670 
opponent's accuracy if you're in a close
quarters<00:04:22.780> battle<00:04:22.810> with<00:04:23.260> them<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.620> this

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
quarters battle with them and this

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.320 
quarters battle with them and this
really<00:04:23.860> does<00:04:24.099> sound<00:04:24.310> like<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.669> ultimate<00:04:25.060> and

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
really does sound like the ultimate and

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.950 
really does sound like the ultimate and
final<00:04:25.390> update<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.500> suppression

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
final update to the suppression

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.480 
final update to the suppression
system<00:04:27.350> in<00:04:27.470> battlefield<00:04:28.009> it<00:04:28.190> should<00:04:28.370> be

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
system in battlefield it should be

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.550 
system in battlefield it should be
working<00:04:28.699> as<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.240> devs<00:04:29.449> intended<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.380> not

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
working as the devs intended and not

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.559 
working as the devs intended and not
being<00:04:30.800> exploited<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:31.669> close-quarter<00:04:32.210> battles

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
being exploited in close-quarter battles

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.210 
being exploited in close-quarter battles
to<00:04:32.810> screw<00:04:33.229> with<00:04:33.259> your<00:04:33.560> opponent's<00:04:34.009> aim

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220

to screw with your opponent's aim
shotguns<00:04:34.789> are<00:04:34.910> also<00:04:35.090> getting<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.479> very<00:04:35.630> cool

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
shotguns are also getting a very cool

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.570 
shotguns are also getting a very cool
update<00:04:36.380> they're<00:04:36.590> trying<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:36.979> make<00:04:37.069> them<00:04:37.370> much

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
update they're trying to make them much

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.550 
update they're trying to make them much
more<00:04:37.759> consistent<00:04:38.210> weapons<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.229> couldn't

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
more consistent weapons and I couldn't

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.290 
more consistent weapons and I couldn't
agree<00:04:39.710> more<00:04:39.800> with<00:04:40.069> this<00:04:40.430> philosophy<00:04:40.610> they<00:04:41.240> are

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
agree more with this philosophy they are

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.089 
agree more with this philosophy they are
highly<00:04:41.569> inconsistent<00:04:42.229> as<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.710> is<00:04:42.830> right<00:04:43.039> now

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
highly inconsistent as it is right now

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.559 
highly inconsistent as it is right now
so<00:04:43.819> what<00:04:43.970> they're<00:04:44.120> doing<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.509> they're

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
so what they're doing is they're

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.629 
so what they're doing is they're
actually<00:04:45.050> adding<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.500> lot<00:04:45.710> more<00:04:45.860> pellets<00:04:46.190> to

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
actually adding a lot more pellets to

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.670 
actually adding a lot more pellets to
the<00:04:46.759> weapon<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.300> reducing<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.020> damage<00:04:48.259> per

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
the weapon and reducing the damage per

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.809 
the weapon and reducing the damage per
pellet<00:04:49.069> so<00:04:49.220> you're<00:04:49.310> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.610> more

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
pellet so you're going to have a more

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.820 
pellet so you're going to have a more
even<00:04:50.150> spread<00:04:50.720> when<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.139> shoot<00:04:51.380> them<00:04:51.560> they're

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
even spread when you shoot them they're

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.320 
even spread when you shoot them they're
also<00:04:51.949> giving<00:04:52.160> them<00:04:52.460> much<00:04:52.639> better<00:04:52.819> damage

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
also giving them much better damage

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.670 
also giving them much better damage
drop-off<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.169> don't<00:04:54.349> believe<00:04:54.620> that

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
drop-off and I don't believe that

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.189 
drop-off and I don't believe that
drop-off<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.400> going<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.669> start<00:04:55.880> till<00:04:56.090> about<00:04:56.199> 25

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
drop-off is going to start till about 25

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.860 
drop-off is going to start till about 25
meters<00:04:57.650> away<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.460> within<00:04:58.880> 25<00:04:59.419> meters<00:04:59.720> are

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
meters away so within 25 meters are

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.540 
meters away so within 25 meters are
closer<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.380> should<00:05:00.560> be<00:05:00.680> getting<00:05:00.830> extremely

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
closer you should be getting extremely

the<00:06:03.349> LMGs<00:06:03.969> PDW<00:06:04.969> s<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.750> it's<00:06:05.900> basically

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
the LMGs PDW s and it's basically

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.230 
the LMGs PDW s and it's basically
designed<00:06:07.099> to<00:06:07.340> allow<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.639> to<00:06:07.759> get<00:06:07.909> a<00:06:07.940> two-shot

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
designed to allow you to get a two-shot

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.140 
designed to allow you to get a two-shot
headshot<00:06:09.110> kill<00:06:09.500> with<00:06:10.130> say<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.580> gun<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:10.849> does

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
headshot kill with say a gun that does

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.600 
headshot kill with say a gun that does
24<00:06:11.690> damage<00:06:12.050> maximum<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:12.830> before<00:06:13.219> you<00:06:13.340> had<00:06:13.490> to

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
24 damage maximum so before you had to

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.700 
24 damage maximum so before you had to
shoot<00:06:13.789> them<00:06:13.969> three<00:06:14.330> times<00:06:14.539> in<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.930> head<00:06:15.139> with

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
shoot them three times in the head with

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.249 
shoot them three times in the head with
a<00:06:15.770> 24<00:06:16.430> max<00:06:16.699> damage<00:06:16.940> gun<00:06:17.330> in<00:06:17.539> close<00:06:17.870> quarters

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
a 24 max damage gun in close quarters

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.570 
a 24 max damage gun in close quarters
this<00:06:18.409> is<00:06:18.530> going<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.770> allow<00:06:18.889> you<00:06:18.919> to<00:06:19.039> do<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.250> two

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
this is going to allow you to do a two

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.430 
this is going to allow you to do a two
shots<00:06:19.849> this<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.509> a<00:06:20.539> really<00:06:20.900> big<00:06:21.020> deal<00:06:21.080> because

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
shots this is a really big deal because

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.320 
shots this is a really big deal because
not<00:06:21.830> only<00:06:21.860> is<00:06:22.099> it<00:06:22.219> going<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.520> reward<00:06:22.639> just<00:06:22.909> the

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
not only is it going to reward just the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.850 
not only is it going to reward just the
average<00:06:23.449> player<00:06:23.870> for<00:06:24.080> aiming<00:06:24.409> for<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.620> head

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
average player for aiming for the head

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.499 
average player for aiming for the head
much<00:06:25.370> more<00:06:25.610> but<00:06:25.759> it's<00:06:25.880> also<00:06:26.030> going<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.389> allow

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
much more but it's also going to allow

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.749 
much more but it's also going to allow
weapons<00:06:26.719> like<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.169> an-94<00:06:27.800> to<00:06:28.580> get<00:06:28.729> a

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
weapons like the an-94 to get a

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.659 
weapons like the an-94 to get a
two-round<00:06:29.240> burst<00:06:29.449> kill<00:06:30.139> in<00:06:30.440> CQB<00:06:31.219> and<00:06:31.460> this<00:06:31.550> is

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
two-round burst kill in CQB and this is

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.490 
two-round burst kill in CQB and this is
going<00:06:31.820> to<00:06:31.880> be<00:06:31.969> a<00:06:32.000> really<00:06:32.479> really<00:06:32.780> cool<00:06:32.900> update

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
going to be a really really cool update

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.230 
going to be a really really cool update
to<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.740> game<00:06:33.919> is<00:06:34.370> probably<00:06:34.610> going<00:06:34.880> to<00:06:34.940> speed

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
to the game is probably going to speed

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.149 
to the game is probably going to speed
up<00:06:35.270> a<00:06:35.449> lot<00:06:35.599> of<00:06:35.630> your<00:06:35.810> firefights<00:06:36.289> in<00:06:36.469> general<00:06:37.039> I

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:37.159 
up a lot of your firefights in general I

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.529 
up a lot of your firefights in general I
would<00:06:37.190> say<00:06:37.339> a<00:06:37.490> lot<00:06:37.669> of<00:06:37.820> players<00:06:37.969> probably<00:06:38.270> get

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
would say a lot of players probably get

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:39.670 
would say a lot of players probably get
at<00:06:38.630> least<00:06:38.659> one<00:06:39.139> hedge

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
at least one hedge

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.620 
at least one hedge
mixed<00:06:40.070> into<00:06:40.340> their<00:06:40.370> general<00:06:40.880> spray<00:06:41.240> of<00:06:41.389> fire

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
mixed into their general spray of fire

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.689 
mixed into their general spray of fire
and<00:06:41.900> so<00:06:42.320> if<00:06:42.410> that<00:06:42.650> one<00:06:42.919> headshot<00:06:43.340> is<00:06:43.430> doing

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
and so if that one headshot is doing

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.430 
and so if that one headshot is doing
bonus<00:06:44.150> damage<00:06:44.360> it's<00:06:44.900> probably<00:06:45.080> going<00:06:45.380> to

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
bonus damage it's probably going to

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.860 
bonus damage it's probably going to
lower<00:06:45.710> your<00:06:45.949> time<00:06:46.220> to<00:06:46.370> kill<00:06:46.580> by<00:06:46.789> one<00:06:47.120> shot<00:06:47.509> so

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
lower your time to kill by one shot so

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.570 
lower your time to kill by one shot so
this<00:06:48.110> is<00:06:48.199> going<00:06:48.320> to<00:06:48.380> be<00:06:48.530> a<00:06:48.560> very<00:06:48.949> very<00:06:49.250> big

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
this is going to be a very very big

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.370 
this is going to be a very very big
update<00:06:50.030> to<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.300> game<00:06:50.449> and<00:06:50.870> I<00:06:50.900> can't<00:06:51.199> wait<00:06:51.350> to
