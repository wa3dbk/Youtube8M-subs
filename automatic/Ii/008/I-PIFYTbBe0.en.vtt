smallest shape I'm gonna go ahead and
cut<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.270> maybe<00:01:36.659> three<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.289> four<00:01:37.409> more<00:01:37.829> just

ginormous pieces we kind of want pieces

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
ginormous pieces we kind of want pieces
all<00:01:47.429> about<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:48.030> same<00:01:48.270> size

all about the same size

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.449 
all about the same size
you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.319> same<00:01:49.560> thickness<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.159> they'll<00:01:50.310> cook

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
you know same thickness so they'll cook

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.940

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
about the same rate that way we don't

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.559 
about the same rate that way we don't
have<00:01:53.069> some<00:01:53.459> that<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.729> super<00:01:53.970> crispy<00:01:54.390> and

yellow in real life okay so we've put in
enough<00:02:11.280> oil<00:02:11.519> basically<00:02:11.849> cover<00:02:12.269> them<00:02:14.930> we<00:02:15.930> turn

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
enough oil basically cover them we turn

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.819 
enough oil basically cover them we turn
on<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> stove<00:02:17.930> now<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.959> like<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.470> add<00:02:19.799> the

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
on the stove now I like to add the

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.520 
on the stove now I like to add the
potatoes<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:20.940> oil<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.390> same<00:02:21.630> time<00:02:21.959> so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
potatoes in the oil at the same time so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.590 
potatoes in the oil at the same time so
they<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.680> heat<00:02:22.980> up<00:02:23.010> together<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:24.180> way<00:02:24.329> when

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
they can heat up together that way when

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.870 
they can heat up together that way when
I<00:02:24.630> dump<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.109> potatoes<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> didn't<00:02:25.799> go<00:02:25.920> water<00:02:26.160> you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
I dump in potatoes I didn't go water you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.449 
I dump in potatoes I didn't go water you
know<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.359> water<00:02:27.690> boils<00:02:28.109> out<00:02:32.900> there<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:33.959> go

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
know and the water boils out there we go

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.880 
know and the water boils out there we go
okay<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> yeah<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:36.959> been<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> gently

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
okay so yeah I just been kind of gently

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.890 
okay so yeah I just been kind of gently
stirring<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.459> every<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.870> keep

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
stirring it every now and then to keep

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.629 
stirring it every now and then to keep
the<00:02:40.290> potatoes<00:02:40.680> we're<00:02:40.920> sticking<00:02:41.280> onto<00:02:41.549> the

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
the potatoes we're sticking onto the

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.250 
the potatoes we're sticking onto the
bottom<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> pan<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:42.840> on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
bottom of the pan and on this on

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.490 
bottom of the pan and on this on
themselves<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:46.049> they're<00:02:46.290> starting

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
themselves you can see they're starting

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.199 
themselves you can see they're starting
to<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.829> watered<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.880> come<00:02:48.030> back<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
to be watered if you can come back a

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.449 
to be watered if you can come back a
little<00:02:48.389> bit<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.930> look<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.920> see<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.250> water

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
little bit and look you see the water

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.330 
little bit and look you see the water
coming<00:02:50.850> up<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:52.440> hard<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.799> see<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> camera

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
coming up it's hard to see on the camera

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.330 
coming up it's hard to see on the camera
but<00:02:53.549> there<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.269> go<00:02:54.450> yeah<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.650> basically<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
but there we go yeah so basically the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.800 
but there we go yeah so basically the
potatoes<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.120> losing<00:02:57.329> most<00:02:57.630> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
potatoes are going to be losing most of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.340 
potatoes are going to be losing most of
the<00:02:57.870> water<00:02:58.109> in<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.470> process<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.609> well<00:02:59.880> as

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the water in this process as well as

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.490 
the water in this process as well as
denaturing<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.819> proteins<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.500> unraveling

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
denaturing the proteins and unraveling

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.670 
denaturing the proteins and unraveling
the<00:03:04.680> starches<00:03:06.290> basically<00:03:07.290> making<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the starches basically making the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680 
the starches basically making the
potatoes

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
potatoes

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.500 
potatoes
easier<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.750> digest<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:12.250> tasty<00:03:12.610> dip<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.910> also

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
easier to digest and tasty dip is also

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.710 
easier to digest and tasty dip is also
putting<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.870> all<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.350> them

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
putting it all in for them

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.360 
putting it all in for them
yep<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.350> this<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.620> going<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.830> take<00:03:17.980> quite<00:03:18.310> a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
yep so this is going to take quite a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.890 
yep so this is going to take quite a
while<00:03:18.460> actually<00:03:18.910> because<00:03:19.300> I<00:03:19.360> got<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> lot<00:03:19.780> of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
while actually because I got a lot of

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.140 
while actually because I got a lot of
potatoes<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.440> here<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:21.460> I'm<00:03:21.550> just<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> go

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
potatoes in here so I'm just going to go

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.030 
potatoes in here so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.690> keep<00:03:22.840> doing<00:03:23.200> what<00:03:23.380> I'm<00:03:23.500> doing<00:03:23.530> and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
ahead and keep doing what I'm doing and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.230 
ahead and keep doing what I'm doing and
tell<00:03:24.280> they're<00:03:24.490> kind<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.850> brown<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.030> crispy

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
tell they're kind of brown and crispy

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.290 
tell they're kind of brown and crispy
all<00:03:28.240> right<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:28.900> we<00:03:29.080> have<00:03:29.110> fries<00:03:29.740> here<00:03:30.300> looks

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
all right so we have fries here looks

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.560 
all right so we have fries here looks
like<00:03:31.390> they're<00:03:31.660> pretty<00:03:32.050> much<00:03:32.260> done<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:34.360> see

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
like they're pretty much done you see

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.480 
like they're pretty much done you see
they<00:03:34.690> don't<00:03:34.780> break<00:03:35.050> apart<00:03:35.260> as<00:03:35.560> easily<00:03:35.740> now<00:03:36.130> and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
they don't break apart as easily now and

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.340 
they don't break apart as easily now and
they're<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> lot<00:03:36.850> too<00:03:37.330> less<00:03:37.630> likely<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.050> stick

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
they're a lot too less likely to stick

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.560 
they're a lot too less likely to stick
to<00:03:38.440> things<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.760> rate<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.270> bubbles

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
to things and the rate that the bubbles

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.360 
to things and the rate that the bubbles
are<00:03:40.720> coming<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:41.080> just<00:03:41.320> much<00:03:41.620> slowed<00:03:41.890> down<00:03:42.130> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
are coming out just much slowed down and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.180 
are coming out just much slowed down and
you<00:03:42.430> don't<00:03:42.610> notice<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.530> steam<00:03:44.530> coming<00:03:44.830> up<00:03:44.980> as

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
you don't notice the steam coming up as

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.760 
you don't notice the steam coming up as
much<00:03:45.400> so<00:03:46.360> initially<00:03:46.900> done<00:03:47.050> let's<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.680> ahead

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
much so initially done let's go ahead

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.300 
much so initially done let's go ahead
and<00:03:47.950> turn<00:03:48.070> those<00:03:48.250> off<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.040> actually

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
and turn those off now this is actually

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.770 
and turn those off now this is actually
going<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:51.670> be<00:03:51.760> crab<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.030> tricky<00:03:52.540> because<00:03:52.720> I

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
going to be crab a tricky because I

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.340 
going to be crab a tricky because I
don't<00:03:52.930> have<00:03:53.230> any<00:03:54.420> like<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.450> strainer<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.290> I'm

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
don't have any like a strainer so I'm

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.610 
don't have any like a strainer so I'm
have<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:56.800> pick<00:03:56.950> them<00:03:57.070> out<00:03:57.220> before<00:03:58.620> you

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
have to just pick them out before you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.949 
have to just pick them out before you
want<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.860> get<00:03:59.950> them<00:04:00.040> out<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.600> foil<00:04:01.600> while

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
want to get them out of the foil while

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.310 
want to get them out of the foil while
they're<00:04:02.080> still<00:04:02.380> hot<00:04:02.709> otherwise<00:04:04.320> they'll

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
they're still hot otherwise they'll

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.720 
they're still hot otherwise they'll
eventually<00:04:05.560> get<00:04:05.950> mushy<00:04:06.250> now<00:04:06.940> absorb<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.570> oil

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
eventually get mushy now absorb that oil

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.360 
eventually get mushy now absorb that oil
put<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> towel<00:04:10.030> down<00:04:10.709> suck<00:04:11.709> out<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.010> extra<00:04:12.340> oil

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
put a towel down suck out the extra oil

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.550 
put a towel down suck out the extra oil
oh<00:04:13.350> yes<00:04:14.380> counting<00:04:14.799> calories<00:04:15.750> all<00:04:16.750> right<00:04:16.870> let's

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
oh yes counting calories all right let's

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.060 
oh yes counting calories all right let's
go<00:04:17.709> ahead

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:32.530 

sip<00:04:25.070> it<00:04:25.250> was<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.780> towel

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.710 

that<00:04:33.140> pulls<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.440> lot<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.740> oil<00:04:33.890> off<00:04:34.690> right<00:04:35.690> so

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
that pulls a lot of the oil off right so

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.830 
that pulls a lot of the oil off right so
actually<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.710> don't<00:04:37.070> want<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.430> put<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:38.150> msg<00:04:38.690> on

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
actually I don't want to put the msg on

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.500 
actually I don't want to put the msg on
them<00:04:38.990> just<00:04:39.200> yet<00:04:39.530> because<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.820> might<00:04:41.180> end<00:04:41.420> up

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
them just yet because it might end up

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.720 
them just yet because it might end up
being<00:04:41.720> tasting<00:04:42.500> terrible<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.220> we<00:04:43.310> don't<00:04:43.490> want

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
being tasting terrible and we don't want

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.580 
being tasting terrible and we don't want
to<00:04:43.850> do<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.050> let's<00:04:45.200> go<00:04:45.320> ahead<00:04:45.470> and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
to do that so let's go ahead and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.490 
to do that so let's go ahead and
sprinkle<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.160> msg<00:04:46.670> on<00:04:46.820> here<00:04:47.350> just<00:04:48.350> do<00:04:48.470> a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
sprinkle the msg on here just do a

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.640 
sprinkle the msg on here just do a
preliminary<00:04:48.770> taste<00:04:49.520> test<00:04:49.940> will<00:04:50.930> flexibility

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
preliminary taste test will flexibility

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.380 
preliminary taste test will flexibility
pella<00:04:51.920> can<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.250> see<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.490> on<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.670> camera<00:04:52.820> let's

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
pella can you see it on the camera let's

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.880 
pella can you see it on the camera let's
go<00:04:53.540> ahead<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.990> try<00:04:54.470> one<00:04:54.500> of<00:04:54.710> these<00:04:56.890> Perico

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
go ahead and try one of these Perico

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:05.070 
go ahead and try one of these Perico
well<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.520> hasn't<00:04:58.640> done<00:04:58.940> anything<00:04:59.090> on<00:04:59.270> it

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.049 

yeah<00:05:06.080> fine<00:05:06.290> go<00:05:06.320> with<00:05:06.620> more

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:14.059 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:18.379 

it's<00:05:15.059> not<00:05:15.179> bad<00:05:15.389> um<00:05:16.789> it<00:05:17.789> doesn't<00:05:17.819> really<00:05:18.089> taste

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
it's not bad um it doesn't really taste

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.979 
it's not bad um it doesn't really taste
salty<00:05:18.989> though<00:05:19.169> that's<00:05:20.069> a<00:05:20.339> let's<00:05:21.269> actually<00:05:21.479> go

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:21.989 
salty though that's a let's actually go

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:25.099 
salty though that's a let's actually go
ahead<00:05:22.019> and<00:05:22.529> add<00:05:22.679> our<00:05:23.009> generic<00:05:23.729> salt<00:05:24.239> to<00:05:24.719> one<00:05:24.989> of

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:25.109 
ahead and add our generic salt to one of

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:32.029 
ahead and add our generic salt to one of
these<00:05:26.869> just<00:05:27.869> nice<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:30.289> okay<00:05:31.289> so<00:05:31.319> let's<00:05:31.619> solve

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
these just nice so okay so let's solve

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.679 
these just nice so okay so let's solve
it<00:05:32.129> fries<00:05:32.399> I'm<00:05:32.999> going<00:05:33.179> to<00:05:33.239> salt<00:05:33.479> these<00:05:33.629> a

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
it fries I'm going to salt these a

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.009 
it fries I'm going to salt these a
little<00:05:34.259> bit<00:05:34.819> not<00:05:35.819> as<00:05:35.969> much<00:05:36.359> as<00:05:36.599> I<00:05:36.689> did<00:05:36.869> the

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:37.019 
little bit not as much as I did the

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.989 
little bit not as much as I did the
others<00:05:37.309> and<00:05:38.309> then<00:05:38.489> we're<00:05:38.579> going<00:05:38.699> to<00:05:38.729> go<00:05:38.879> ahead

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
others and then we're going to go ahead

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.899 
others and then we're going to go ahead
and<00:05:39.269> put<00:05:39.419> some<00:05:39.449> msg<00:05:40.019> on<00:05:40.169> these<00:05:40.819> that<00:05:41.819> way

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
and put some msg on these that way

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.139 
and put some msg on these that way
there's<00:05:42.119> not<00:05:42.299> as<00:05:42.449> much<00:05:42.859> salt<00:05:44.029> but<00:05:45.029> they

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:45.149 
there's not as much salt but they

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.729 
there's not as much salt but they
contain<00:05:45.419> Animas<00:05:45.779> G<00:05:46.109> so<00:05:46.529> we<00:05:46.799> should<00:05:47.239> get<00:05:48.239> a<00:05:48.269> nice

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:48.739

contain Animas G so we should get a nice
feel<00:05:49.739> for<00:05:49.769> things<00:05:50.869> that<00:05:51.869> these<00:05:52.049> ones<00:05:52.259> taste

who<00:06:46.289> knows<00:06:50.509> no<00:06:51.509> only<00:06:52.139> in<00:06:52.439> super<00:06:53.159> high

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:53.309 
who knows no only in super high

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:55.999 
who knows no only in super high
quantities<00:06:53.879> I<00:06:54.179> mean<00:06:55.109> it's<00:06:55.289> it's<00:06:55.559> a<00:06:55.619> naturally

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
quantities I mean it's it's a naturally

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.579 
quantities I mean it's it's a naturally
occurring<00:06:56.339> chemical<00:06:56.729> in<00:06:56.789> your<00:06:56.819> body<00:06:56.999> just

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:57.589 
occurring chemical in your body just

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.449 
occurring chemical in your body just
never<00:06:58.589> hurt<00:06:58.769> you<00:06:58.889> unless<00:06:59.009> you<00:06:59.249> eat<00:06:59.279> an

00:06:59.449 --> 00:06:59.459 
never hurt you unless you eat an

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:03.529 
never hurt you unless you eat an
excessive<00:07:00.119> amount<00:07:00.389> all<00:07:00.989> right<00:07:01.279> so<00:07:02.279> I<00:07:02.819> think

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
excessive amount all right so I think

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.159 
excessive amount all right so I think
that<00:07:04.169> was<00:07:04.409> an<00:07:04.589> exact<00:07:05.009> time<00:07:05.399> I<00:07:05.729> had<00:07:06.029> all<00:07:06.419> three

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
that was an exact time I had all three

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.159 
that was an exact time I had all three
of<00:07:07.469> the<00:07:07.949> possible<00:07:08.519> things<00:07:09.359> I<00:07:09.509> was<00:07:09.629> expecting

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
of the possible things I was expecting

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.309 
of the possible things I was expecting
from<00:07:10.349> that<00:07:11.089> the<00:07:12.089> guy<00:07:12.239> couldn't<00:07:12.539> tell<00:07:12.899> and<00:07:13.169> the

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 
from that the guy couldn't tell and the

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.139 
from that the guy couldn't tell and the
two<00:07:13.469> girls<00:07:13.739> were<00:07:13.889> to<00:07:14.009> split<00:07:14.699> between<00:07:14.849> which

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:15.149 
two girls were to split between which

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.429 
two girls were to split between which
one<00:07:15.329> they<00:07:15.449> liked<00:07:17.689> oh<00:07:18.689> you<00:07:18.959> couldn't<00:07:19.259> decide

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:19.439 
one they liked oh you couldn't decide

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.059 
one they liked oh you couldn't decide
which<00:07:19.559> one<00:07:19.709> you<00:07:19.739> liked<00:07:19.979> yeah<00:07:21.649> so<00:07:22.649> the<00:07:22.800> theory

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
which one you liked yeah so the theory

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.939 
which one you liked yeah so the theory
with<00:07:23.339> monosodium<00:07:24.029> glutamate<00:07:24.209> is<00:07:24.749> that<00:07:25.709> it

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:25.949 
with monosodium glutamate is that it

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:27.170 
with monosodium glutamate is that it
actually

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
actually

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.580 
actually
-<00:07:27.330> tastes<00:07:27.660> like<00:07:28.610> not<00:07:29.610> saltier<00:07:30.330> than<00:07:30.360> salt<00:07:30.870> but

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
- tastes like not saltier than salt but

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.740 
- tastes like not saltier than salt but
more<00:07:31.800> savoury<00:07:32.400> than<00:07:32.430> salt<00:07:32.940> for<00:07:33.270> the<00:07:33.449> same

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750 
more savoury than salt for the same

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.770 
more savoury than salt for the same
amount<00:07:34.229> of<00:07:34.440> material<00:07:34.940> so<00:07:35.940> you<00:07:36.030> can<00:07:36.360> add<00:07:36.479> less

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 
amount of material so you can add less

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.379 
amount of material so you can add less
of<00:07:37.020> it<00:07:37.169> and<00:07:37.320> have<00:07:37.500> less<00:07:37.770> total<00:07:38.039> sodium's<00:07:38.610> in

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:39.389 
of it and have less total sodium's in

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.810 
of it and have less total sodium's in
already<00:07:39.600> at<00:07:39.750> the<00:07:39.870> same<00:07:40.080> savory<00:07:41.070> level<00:07:41.370> you

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
already at the same savory level you

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.240 
already at the same savory level you
know<00:07:41.880> if<00:07:41.940> you<00:07:42.030> have<00:07:42.120> the<00:07:42.240> graph<00:07:42.479> of<00:07:43.250> salty

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.250 
know if you have the graph of salty

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.640 
know if you have the graph of salty
versus<00:07:44.940> you<00:07:45.600> know<00:07:45.690> the<00:07:45.840> amount<00:07:45.960> of<00:07:46.139> salt<00:07:46.410> for

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
versus you know the amount of salt for

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.939 
versus you know the amount of salt for
steamed<00:07:46.830> out<00:07:46.949> how<00:07:47.190> good<00:07:47.370> it<00:07:47.520> tastes<00:07:47.940> sodium

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:48.949 
steamed out how good it tastes sodium

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.070 
steamed out how good it tastes sodium
chloride<00:07:49.949> Peaks<00:07:50.880> earlier<00:07:51.330> than<00:07:51.570> the<00:07:51.750> sodium

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 
chloride Peaks earlier than the sodium

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.820 
chloride Peaks earlier than the sodium
glutamate<00:07:52.440> would<00:07:52.970> that<00:07:53.970> makes<00:07:54.150> any<00:07:54.300> sense

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:54.830 
glutamate would that makes any sense

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.170 
glutamate would that makes any sense
so<00:07:55.830> as<00:07:56.009> an<00:07:56.130> interesting<00:07:56.490> little<00:07:56.669> test<00:07:56.910> I<00:07:57.150> think

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 
so as an interesting little test I think

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.029 
so as an interesting little test I think
I<00:07:57.509> could<00:07:57.660> have<00:07:57.780> done<00:07:57.870> a<00:07:57.900> lot<00:07:58.080> better<00:07:58.289> I'm<00:07:58.979> sure

00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 
I could have done a lot better I'm sure

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.890 
I could have done a lot better I'm sure
that<00:07:59.430> people<00:07:59.669> have<00:07:59.759> done<00:07:59.910> better<00:08:00.240> tests<00:08:00.780> this

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 
that people have done better tests this

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.089 
that people have done better tests this
is<00:08:01.020> just<00:08:01.199> something<00:08:01.349> I<00:08:01.500> kind<00:08:01.740> of<00:08:01.770> wanted<00:08:01.979> to

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 
is just something I kind of wanted to

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:04.430 
is just something I kind of wanted to
see<00:08:02.190> myself<00:08:02.430> I<00:08:03.000> kind<00:08:03.660> of<00:08:03.690> wanted<00:08:03.900> to<00:08:04.050> try

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 
see myself I kind of wanted to try

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.800 
see myself I kind of wanted to try
tasting<00:08:04.680> it<00:08:04.949> myself<00:08:05.220> more<00:08:05.460> than<00:08:05.550> anything<00:08:05.810> so

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:06.810 
tasting it myself more than anything so

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.510 
tasting it myself more than anything so
I<00:08:07.020> hope<00:08:07.229> you<00:08:07.349> guys<00:08:07.470> enjoyed<00:08:07.800> and<00:08:08.009> I'll<00:08:08.280> see<00:08:08.310> you

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.880 
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
