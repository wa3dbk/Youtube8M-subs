 thanks for being here on the channel and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.990
 let's continue with that exchange you release the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
 today after talking quickly 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.420
 some important characteristics of 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.580
 bicarbonate the bicarbonate every time 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.530
 you find new properties very 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.850
 interesting for both health and 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.800
 for the house 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.800
 within this league that is around here 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.350
 I'm going to leave you a lot of information 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.360
 more detailed with many more data 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.690
 so if you can click on this 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.670
 box can go directly to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.280
 all the extensive information but it's a 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.130
 quick summary first of all the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 bicarbonate has been discovered that helps 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.680
 to alkalize the body is what 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.210
 means that acidity drops and this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 greatly diminishes many 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 potential diseases that you could 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 have in fact right now there is a 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.070
 very large movement in which it is said 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.440
 that a large pair of diseases that 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.409
 I know it exists in the world would come 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.990
 due to very acid bodies that eat 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.020
 a lot of sugar to eat if time 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.720
 acid food that returns to the body more 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.060
 susceptible to many diseases the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.790
 carbonate can also help you 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.280
 Clean the teeth to clean even 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.979
 you can products inside your house 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.160
 objects inside your house but for more 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.050
 detail more information visit the site 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.210
 Route indeed true dotcom 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.300
 there are already enough studies 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.430
 even already pretty experiments 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.259
 interesting that well in fact also 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 look for them on youtube and within this 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.560
 I'll share some league where it was created 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.200
 it is almost already confirmed that they help 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.810
 to prevent cancer and even to 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.620
 attacking it there are still studies that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.019
 they are doing 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.360
 it's not the magic key either but it's 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.040
 quite interesting to investigate it the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 bicarbonate is also very cheap is 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.780
 very easy to get and I think that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.780
 Well, you can find many uses for 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780
 you and for inside your house see you later
