purchased online in this video I'm going
to<00:00:10.080> show<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.379> how<00:00:10.589> to<00:00:10.650> fit<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> lower<00:00:11.309> rotor

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
to show you how to fit the lower rotor

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.480

and the loudspeaker as well as the Malta
and<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:15.509> thing<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.050> to<00:00:16.170> turn<00:00:16.380> the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
and the first thing to do is to turn the

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.040 
and the first thing to do is to turn the
cabinet<00:00:16.980> upside<00:00:17.370> down<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.300> fit<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> lower<00:00:18.840> row

to bottom bearing in place and before
you<00:00:21.570> fit<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.110> place<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.040> good<00:00:23.190> idea

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you fit this in place it's a good idea

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880 
you fit this in place it's a good idea
to<00:00:23.640> change<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> bearing<00:00:24.740> bearings<00:00:25.740> are

rotor<00:01:05.790> sonic<00:01:06.119> speaker<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.259> a<00:01:07.290> little

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
rotor sonic speaker so it was a little

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
rotor sonic speaker so it was a little
bit<00:01:07.680> too<00:01:07.860> long<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> Leslie<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.759> four

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
bit too long for the Leslie one four

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.200 
bit too long for the Leslie one four
five<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.110> using<00:01:10.530> my<00:01:10.560> lathe<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.340> shortened<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
five so using my lathe I shortened the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.660 
five so using my lathe I shortened the
shafting<00:01:12.719> machine<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> spigot<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> top<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.660 
shafting machine to spigot on the top to
the<00:01:14.790> same<00:01:15.000> diameter<00:01:15.329> as<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.869> rubber<00:01:16.049> grommet

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the same diameter as the rubber grommet

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
the same diameter as the rubber grommet
you<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:17.820> notice<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.149> I'm<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.840> cable

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you will notice that I'm using a cable

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.800 
you will notice that I'm using a cable
tie<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.829> the<00:01:20.250> pulley<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.909> anchor<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
tie on the pulley to anchor it to the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.840 
tie on the pulley to anchor it to the
drum<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.770> reason<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.219> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
drum the reason for this is just a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490 
drum the reason for this is just a
safety<00:01:24.060> precaution<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.930> stop<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.289> drum

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
safety precaution to stop the drum

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
safety precaution to stop the drum
dropping<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.969> use<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> cable<00:01:27.539> tie<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
dropping if you do use a cable tie like

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.920 
dropping if you do use a cable tie like
this<00:01:28.310> don't<00:01:29.310> pull<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.549> tight<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
this don't pull it tight if you do it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
this don't pull it tight if you do it
will<00:01:31.109> warp<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> pulley<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> belt<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
will warp the pulley and the belt is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
will warp the pulley and the belt is
likely<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.939> fall<00:01:33.149> off

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
likely to fall off

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.370 
likely to fall off
I<00:01:35.000> wanted<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.149> facility<00:01:36.719> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.899> able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> use

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I wanted the facility to be able to use

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
I wanted the facility to be able to use

castle<00:01:49.259> cases<00:01:49.679> came<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.039> with<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> idea<00:01:50.670> of

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.320 
fit another speaker there's a thicker
rim<00:02:09.140> then<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.160> would<00:02:10.369> need<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.880> use<00:02:11.060> different

bolts<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:12.020> thought<00:02:12.230> I'll<00:02:12.410> use<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.800> same<00:02:13.010> bolts

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
principle of these Leslie speakers is

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.580 
principle of these Leslie speakers is
that<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.330> base<00:02:50.510> rotor<00:02:50.959> travels<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
that the base rotor travels in the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.260 
that the base rotor travels in the
opposite<00:02:51.980> direction<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.640> treble<00:02:53.060> rotor

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
opposite direction to the treble rotor

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.780 
opposite direction to the treble rotor
and<00:02:53.660> slows<00:02:54.560> down<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.100> speeds<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.610> at<00:02:55.760> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
and slows down and speeds up at a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.930 
and slows down and speeds up at a
different<00:02:56.060> rate<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.200> treble<00:02:57.620> rotor<00:02:57.940> this

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
different rate to the treble rotor this

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940 
different rate to the treble rotor this
is<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> first<00:02:59.510> test<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.930> the<00:02:59.989> lower<00:03:00.260> rotor<00:03:00.560> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
is the first test of the lower rotor and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.190 
is the first test of the lower rotor and
it<00:03:01.370> runs<00:03:01.550> very<00:03:01.670> quietly<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.750> very<00:03:02.959> well
