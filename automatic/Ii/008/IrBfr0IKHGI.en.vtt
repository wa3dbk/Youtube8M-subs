nerve<00:00:33.329> block<00:00:33.719> literally<00:00:34.559> took<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:35.070> minutes

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
nerve block literally took two minutes

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400 
nerve block literally took two minutes
to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.210> she<00:00:36.630> doesn't<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> walk

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to do and she doesn't have to walk

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
to do and she doesn't have to walk
around<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:38.129> her<00:00:38.579> lip<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.180> hanging<00:00:39.510> down

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
around with her lip kind of hanging down

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
around with her lip kind of hanging down
because<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> anesthesia<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.950> anything<00:00:40.980> like

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because of anesthesia or anything like

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.319 
because of anesthesia or anything like
that<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.640> those<00:00:41.940> things<00:00:42.090> are<00:00:42.270> really

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that so those things are really

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
that so those things are really
unnecessary<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> lot<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
unnecessary now that we have a lot of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
unnecessary now that we have a lot of
products<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.450> actual<00:00:46.020> lidocaine

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
products that have actual lidocaine

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.940 
products that have actual lidocaine
already<00:00:46.980> mixed<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.629> product<00:00:49.079> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
already mixed in with the product so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
already mixed in with the product so
that's<00:00:50.100> why<00:00:50.219> we're<00:00:50.370> using<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.700> Juvederm<00:00:51.090> XC<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that's why we're using a Juvederm XC and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
that's why we're using a Juvederm XC and

filth or old columns I haven't even put
anything<00:01:29.159> into<00:01:29.430> her<00:01:29.850> upper<00:01:30.180> lip<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.930> that's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
anything into her upper lip but that's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.440

already rotated the lip up just a touch

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.620 
already rotated the lip up just a touch
to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.740> more<00:01:35.340> voluminous<00:01:35.729> without

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to make it look more voluminous without

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
to make it look more voluminous without
having<00:01:37.290> put<00:01:37.470> any<00:01:37.650> filler<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.640> we're

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
having put any filler there so we're

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.469 
having put any filler there so we're
gonna<00:01:38.880> continue<00:01:39.770> Marie<00:01:40.770> has<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little<00:01:42.000> scar

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
gonna continue Marie has a little scar

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
gonna continue Marie has a little scar
that<00:01:42.509> she<00:01:43.110> acquired<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.710> she<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> child

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that she acquired when she was a child

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.149 
that she acquired when she was a child
and<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.689> use<00:01:45.899> fillers<00:01:46.320> sometimes<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and so you can use fillers sometimes to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.030 
and so you can use fillers sometimes to
almost<00:01:47.549> mask<00:01:47.880> those<00:01:48.180> scars<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.320> fill<00:01:49.649> in
