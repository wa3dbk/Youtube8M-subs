00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.130
 or what the camera 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 p 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 you can find them and the director of photography and camera of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.290
 and a year ago I was in love with the project from the first time I read 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.160
 the script and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 I knew 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 what was the tone and lenses that were wanted with this movie 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.340
 paramount 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 very satisfying to work with him and with the group work on this story 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.430
 because every day was a creative challenge was a challenge or visual 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.649
 somehow reinvent himself in everything he had done in the past 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.900
 I wear 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.110
 12 years doing advertising and after the act while they have another aesthetic 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.950
 without figures 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.210
 this one had nothing 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.510
 they do not want to give me how the rhythm and the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.100
 to the conditions that are going to be given on the street 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.630
 the little one 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.840
 semaphores with the chaotic 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.640
 traffic with him 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.280
 murray and the exmo 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.620
 i somehow had to do with the camera and with photography 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.890
 in this gene this project had to do the camera i 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 invited with throw me the drought monitor forget me 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.479
 that the community could have the amount 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.789
 space but you already have to learn to be everything from the camera without 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:00.690
 drop it 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.320
 giving directions to the wounded scream iii every time he jumps into the camera he 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.799
 I was losing moment is shaping up like the pace of the movie 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.390
 and the first days I liked how much work to understand and 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.560
 there came a point where we ignored the polluters we had 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.719
 much more time to man 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.069
 and that gave like certain rigor praises the film the fact that you are all the 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.239
 time with 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.819
 framing ready with 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.819
 with the proposal and ma 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.819
 allows the art department to the department of 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.339
 to unlock and I to him 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.779
 ap each of apartments as being very 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.109
 outstanding and very focused on what to do if things work 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.469
 at a modest and surprising pace to guarantee without that 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.319
 it was 6 already lean report the morning and at six fifteen 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.559
 almost 15 minutes after breakfast we had already made a plan 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.539
 about that normally happens to us formally sep 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.509
 if there are many hours of preparation to steal a plane here 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.509
 we are almost ready all the time 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:05.919
 in India 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.919
 when we put this process in the film 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.299
 one to a more documentary trend and much faster work 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.509
 percent we think that 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.689
 that at some point it was announced to mess too much to keep the 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:20.659
 control of the company 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.099
 in the image the control of the frame and measures 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.009
 neither the colors nor 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.299
 of certain things that were important also for us 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.829
 but in the end it's like 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.179
 you a synchrony 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.079
 in the whole department watching the teams 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.239
 that the one that allowed it to go and and out was working and 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.869
 and sometimes we have as 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.869
 min some time to give us 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.729
 as 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.569
 some luxuries 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.569
 groups of in a matter with more 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.629
 eder put together a cambuche that was wonderful to have a combustion of 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.009
 all things are real and they are 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.369
 they are really nothing, nothing false 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.809
 and that's how in each of the locations where 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.569
 It was like respecting what you had to try to take advantage of the best light 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.119
 i 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.399
 take him out as 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.749
 as 'the cuckoo' to science what we are seeing soto as 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.439
 good homework of all children 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.999
 first as how professional challenge was impressive 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.550
 for all 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.430
 what allowed me to explore 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.499
 reinvent 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:34.729
 but also 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.849
 cent and already the last day of shooting 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.430
 e that human experience can 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.580
 an invaluable milk to know 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.749
 pretty 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.539
 I have never had problems in the past with drugs and alcohol and that 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.689
 who have been able to overcome it and face as heart 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.349
 all this kind of work 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.900
 like this one 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.900
 almost certainly one hundred 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.529
 this four years ago 1 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.150
 impartial say 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
 at this time nor the courts 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.159
 criticizes us but they are already part 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.159
 so the past for us at this time do not count 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.229
 about your fuel 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.729
 it has nothing to do with the people we are meeting 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.389
 in these lasts months 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.120
 and that's the nice thing is that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.449
 learn that is 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.740
 in other conditions it would be impossible 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.749
 only in these conditions that you face 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.159
 the daily life and that of having lunch at breakfast having dinner with them and traveling 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.999
 with them 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.619
 it allows you as for the people deals and to know a human side in each one 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:46.789
 of them and 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.479
 these religious 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.160
 the tragic outcome
