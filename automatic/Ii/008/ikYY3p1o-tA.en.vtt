00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.130 
and a lot of times a glue construction
will<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.540> stitching<00:02:19.540> or<00:02:20.020> I'll

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
will have just like stitching or I'll

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.059 
will have just like stitching or I'll
look<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.440> rubber<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:23.290> reason<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.800> because

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
look like rubber the reason is because

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.120 
look like rubber the reason is because

one more grip or if I want to go back to

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.080 
one more grip or if I want to go back to
it<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.170> do<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.320> rubber<00:02:41.650> leather<00:02:42.430> sole<00:02:42.730> he<00:02:42.940> can

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
it and do a rubber leather sole he can

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.580 
it and do a rubber leather sole he can
do<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.770> now<00:02:45.720> what's<00:02:46.720> also<00:02:47.050> going<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.470> be

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
do that now what's also going to be

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.680 
do that now what's also going to be
different<00:02:47.709> between<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.250> cheaper<00:02:48.790> boot<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.450> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
different between a cheaper boot and a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.600 
different between a cheaper boot and a
high-quality<00:02:49.900> boot<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.980> leather<00:02:51.340> they

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
high-quality boot is the leather they

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.790 
high-quality boot is the leather they
use<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.120> not<00:02:52.390> all<00:02:52.540> leather<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.170> created<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
use and not all leather is created the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.610 
use and not all leather is created the
same<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:55.120> high<00:02:55.540> quality<00:02:55.810> boot<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.380> going<00:02:56.410> to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
same so a high quality boot is going to

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.520 
same so a high quality boot is going to
use<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:57.040> full<00:02:57.250> grain<00:02:57.519> leather<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.530> cheaper

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
use a full grain leather and cheaper

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.890 
use a full grain leather and cheaper
boot<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.950> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.280> use<00:03:00.519> essentially<00:03:01.209> metal

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
boot is going to use essentially metal

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.699 
boot is going to use essentially metal
or<00:03:02.110> excuse<00:03:02.410> me

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
or excuse me

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.710 
or excuse me
leather<00:03:03.190> bits<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.700> have<00:03:03.760> been<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.360> mash

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
leather bits that have been like mash

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.560 
leather bits that have been like mash
together<00:03:05.019> with<00:03:05.560> glue<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.300> smushed<00:03:07.300> into

together with glue and smushed into

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.190 
together with glue and smushed into
place<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.320> processed<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.459> hell<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.989> why

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
place and processed the hell and why

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.690 
place and processed the hell and why
does<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.410> make<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.650> difference<00:03:12.070> well<00:03:12.370> first

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
does that make a difference well first

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.070 
does that make a difference well first
of<00:03:12.850> all<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.360> going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.600> be<00:03:13.690> able<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.870> last

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
of all it's going to be able to last

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.610 
of all it's going to be able to last
longer

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
longer

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.100 
longer
you<00:03:14.890> can<00:03:15.040> scuff<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.820> can<00:03:16.060> wear<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:17.049> a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
you can scuff it up you can wear it a

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.210 
you can scuff it up you can wear it a
little<00:03:17.230> bit<00:03:17.440> more<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.829> if<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.010> need<00:03:18.160> to
