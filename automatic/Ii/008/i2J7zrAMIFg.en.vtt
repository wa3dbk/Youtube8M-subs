through the same stitch in front of the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.789 
through the same stitch in front of the
yarn<00:01:41.670> behind<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.060> yarn<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.479> pull<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> through

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
through both so there's your double

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.240 
through both so there's your double
crochet<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.869> as<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.229> notice<00:01:49.470> when<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
crochet and as you notice when you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
crochet and as you notice when you
continue<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.140> double<00:01:52.140> crocheting<00:01:53.270> you're

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
continue on double crocheting you're

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
continue on double crocheting you're
going<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> get<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> much<00:01:54.899> looser<00:01:55.200> stitch<00:01:56.100> here

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
going to get a much looser stitch here

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
going to get a much looser stitch here
and<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.240> work<00:01:57.420> will<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:58.049> faster<00:01:58.320> because

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and the work will go much faster because

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.910 
and the work will go much faster because
the<00:01:59.040> stitch<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.759> larger<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
the stitch is a little larger and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
the stitch is a little larger and
remember<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.280> put<00:02:02.490> two<00:02:02.759> stitches<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.570> each

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
remember to put two stitches in each

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.010 
remember to put two stitches in each
hole<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> good<00:02:06.689> shape

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
hole so that you can get a good shape

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.590 
hole so that you can get a good shape
for<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.469> beanie

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
for your beanie

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.880 
for your beanie
so<00:02:09.600> as<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.930> see<00:02:10.200> these<00:02:10.380> stitches<00:02:10.620> are

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so as you can see these stitches are

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.200 
so as you can see these stitches are
going<00:02:11.010> to<00:02:11.070> be<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.370> bit<00:02:11.550> bigger<00:02:11.790> than<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
going to be a little bit bigger than the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.720 
going to be a little bit bigger than the
stitches<00:02:12.600> around<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.590> it'll<00:02:14.400> might<00:02:14.610> be

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
stitches around here and it'll might be

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.980 
stitches around here and it'll might be
a<00:02:14.760> little<00:02:14.940> bit<00:02:15.090> easier<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.420> work<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:15.660> because

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
a little bit easier to work with because

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.360 
a little bit easier to work with because
each<00:02:16.320> hole<00:02:16.530> will<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.160> bigger

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
each hole will be a little bit bigger

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
each hole will be a little bit bigger
and<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.760> put<00:02:17.910> more<00:02:18.060> stitches<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.780> each

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
and you can put more stitches in each

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.500 
and you can put more stitches in each
one<00:02:19.680> okay<00:02:20.370> I'll<00:02:20.490> show<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.820> again<00:02:21.060> put<00:02:21.330> your
