00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 violence 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 she does not say it was a rumor and no longer what 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 confirms but good what she says is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.820
 I prefer to remember it well obviously so 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.920
 let's see what happens not now 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.220
 I speak is sergio maravilla martínez and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 it also speaks exactly where 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.840
 We were interviewing an ex 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 your girlfriend silvana cassette and the one 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.059
 I remember tele of her was a relationship 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 very pretty what lasted was very beautiful in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.719
 One year he said approximately no 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 They were less months but it was very nice 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.520
 intense it was a shame that there 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 finished as it was finished is not 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.670
 ends marriages of thirty-odd 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.430
 years like that of my parents then 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.739
 then the relationship with her very 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 painful the end very sad as I eat 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.370
 all end no no it's not nice when it 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 ends she was a little nervous 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 to talk when I go away like he got 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 nervous I do not know why 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.910
 so our relationship in sauce with 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.610
 he finishes when they finished they finish 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.920
 good salt but good 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.990
 there was a lot of love it was very beautiful what 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.460
 lasted what lasted was very beautiful is a 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.380
 pity about those things that end 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.360
 but what he already told us was that he preferred 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.560
 stay with the good of the relationship be 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.990
 last medical there are things that end 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.760
 well clear I also exist this more 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.200
 It is worth turning the page and saying I'm staying 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.640
 with the good thing that people leave you with 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670
 that you did not live then is 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.780
 fundamental is that we went up I asked 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.490
 the same to her but she told me about 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.680
 boxer did not want to talk to the person 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.260
 you want to speak the common person with 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.580
 few words like the definitive no 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.100
 I would talk about the journalist journalist 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 super very smart and I wish you 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.130
 always the best as always is a 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.230
 lovely girl thank you very much 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.570
 thank you very much to you teacher 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.000
 Well there is also a yellow kingfisher 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 going that the good and also saying that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.490
 relations as we said rafa no 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.580
 they ended well obviously not 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.580
 they finish well 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:04.080
 what comes foundational I do not know if 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.030
 for this medium where much better a 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.640
 title does not yet know well where 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.640
 he got it, imagine they called him after 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.630
 decide and decide I also imagine his 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.280
 sports representative must decide 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.190
 but I think that marvel in 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.770
 some point I think it's more 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.630
 seduced and more delighted by this 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.700
 participate in the show match star stand 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.260
 up that by the theme of the ring is a 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 feeling that I have I do not know 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.060
 also dance that box but I think 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.829
 because it's a very rigorous sport with the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.829
 subject of training with the theme of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.530
 they consider it a distraction for 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.530
 he but good 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.930
 at 37 years old 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.180
 think about the future 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.530
 of right but between this it seems 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.189
 that the contract that dollar to worse is more 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.109
 the fight 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:30.340
 the boy of the showmatch yes but 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:32.170
 It's not good when an artist 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.450
 international and I think it's 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.049
 thinking that mine be a cushion the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.049
 fight for the title 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.740
 in this module this for each game of 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.740
 option 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.580
 Is right 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.300
 of earning a lot of money with the issue of 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.460
 fights and the next I think it's a 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.280
 fight for millions if mayweather will 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.670
 he arrives to give the fight he fights he won 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.670
 misses 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.200
 wonder then I knew him 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.130
 resorting 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:46.620
 it's a feeling that I would like 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.620
 Andre and Andrea 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.639
 since she tells us let's say what 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.469
 that you see in a man to have the 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.300
 feeling that that is the question that 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:58.800
 you have to do is what I see that 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:04.599
 is the superficial is different you feel 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:07.930
 then the muscles but it may be that 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.729
 same but what about the way of 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.129
 wear neither the muscles nor the 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.500
 way of speaking good is the obsessions 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:17.800
 by andrea benítez 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.590
 and then we're going to see obviously already 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.750
 the criticisms came out the program 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.779
 marcelo tinelli the first speaker is 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.909
 that the fixed is that the enemy was losing 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:31.770
 paralysis to sebae after pause 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.770
 speaks pergolini about showmatch 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.280
 if not
