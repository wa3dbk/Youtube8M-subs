00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.330

 and what happens that costs you is not because 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.690

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 I have a pretty news 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.779
 Exciting pretty and flirtatious recently 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.310
 the charly intel page published a list 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 of questions charly interested one page 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 that you have a lot of information from 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.099
 call of duty is from the pages that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.800
 update more as you can say more 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.720
 fast information and has a lot 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
 good information and recently published 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 a list of frequently asked questions 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.860
 the fans did to them because they 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.630
 they have enough information I tell them of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.649
 call of duty and good one of the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.590
 questions most questions 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.539
 they were multiplayer but one of them 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.969
 it was zombies and the question says well 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.789
 the four original characters are going to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.920
 back they answered yes but no 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.079
 you will be able to use them in transit 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.289
 in the same way they will be 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.030
 present in some form of some 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.910
 better way 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.530
 that I can think of this two theories two 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.379
 theories one has to be true of 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.210
 egg or the thing is going to be like in carlos 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.380
 of death and how many of you 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.299
 they said it's going to be like every time 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.090
 that are going to be in some other way that 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.979
 we're going to hear them in voices or something like that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.320
 or something else that makes me think the same 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.930
 fact that they say we're not going to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.150
 to be able to use in transit, that is, we are 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.980
 specifying that in transit 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.890
 trànsit is a game mode are of 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.400
 agreement so possibly in a 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.290
 another game mode if they can be used or 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.020
 possibly you will not be able to use them 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.030
 and it's going to be like in like some interest in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.620
 which they hear their voices but so 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 less gentlemen is confirmed that they were going to 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.590
 obviously obviously going back 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.850
 We knew this but you'll see that I 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.550
 I wanted to hear from a reliable source 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.770
 they were going to come back then then 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.240
 nothing are just these two theories of a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.040
 egg one of these have to be true 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.380
 or they return in a hysteria or 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.390
 they return in another game mode nothing more 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.920
 so then, well, nothing, that would be 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.750
 all leave your comments here below with 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.890
 what they think 15 many of us see 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.890
 then goodbye
