then sand it this is my version of wet
cleaning<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:36.110> how<00:00:37.110> many

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cleaning which I don't know how many

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.380 
cleaning which I don't know how many
people<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
people do this but this is the way that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.440 
people do this but this is the way that
I<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.950> works<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.219> me<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.450> wetting

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
I do it works for me so I'm just wetting

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.549 
I do it works for me so I'm just wetting
those<00:00:46.079> seam<00:00:46.500> lines<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> running<00:00:49.110> my<00:00:49.260> brush

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
those seam lines and running my brush

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.689 
those seam lines and running my brush
along<00:00:49.920> them<00:00:54.079> there's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.410> bump<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
along them there's a little bump in the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
along them there's a little bump in the
porcelain<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.800> wet<00:00:59.160> slip

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
porcelain so I'm gonna take my wet slip

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
porcelain so I'm gonna take my wet slip
and<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.300> fill<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.899> those<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.379> bumps<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and just fill in those little bumps I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.789 
and just fill in those little bumps I
think<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.199> cleaning<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
think that what you know cleaning this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.730 
think that what you know cleaning this
way<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:06.420> messy<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.530> much

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
way is not as messy I don't have as much

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
way is not as messy I don't have as much
dust<00:01:08.189> which<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.930> hazardous<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.939> because<00:01:11.939> my

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
dust which is hazardous and because my

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.450 
dust which is hazardous and because my
you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.689> pieces<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.409> small<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you know my pieces are so small I can I

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.950 
you know my pieces are so small I can I
can<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:17.000> don't<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.240> how<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> works

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
can do this I don't know how it works

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.649 
can do this I don't know how it works
some<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> larger<00:01:19.740> pieces<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.060> seems<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
some of larger pieces but it seems to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.929 
some of larger pieces but it seems to
work<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.490> her<00:01:23.490> head<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.470> wonky

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
work on this her head is a little wonky

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
work on this her head is a little wonky
so<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.150> gonna<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> let<00:01:27.810> her<00:01:27.900> rest<00:01:28.170> or

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so I'm gonna have to let her rest or

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.940 
so I'm gonna have to let her rest or

this<00:01:33.579> is<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.759> piece<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.299> that<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:34.719> think<00:01:35.289> it's

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
this is a piece of that I think it's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.580 
this is a piece of that I think it's
called<00:01:35.560> convoluted<00:01:36.340> foam<00:01:36.670> they<00:01:37.060> use<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.390> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
called convoluted foam they use it for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.310 
called convoluted foam they use it for
mattresses<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.770> stuff<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.960> taken<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.110> and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
mattresses and stuff and I taken it and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.080 
mattresses and stuff and I taken it and
cut<00:01:41.679> a<00:01:41.710> circle<00:01:42.070> out<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.729> put<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:43.030> a

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
cut a circle out of it and put it on a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.350 
cut a circle out of it and put it on a
tray<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.990> this<00:01:44.799> way<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.039> can<00:01:45.369> rest<00:01:45.670> my<00:01:45.850> pieces

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
tray and this way I can rest my pieces

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.609 
tray and this way I can rest my pieces
in<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.700> tray<00:01:49.119> while<00:01:49.509> I'm<00:01:49.689> working<00:01:50.530> on

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
in this tray while I'm working on

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.480 
in this tray while I'm working on
something<00:01:50.950> else<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.750> um<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:53.950> just<00:01:54.280> sit

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
something else and um they can just sit

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.100 
something else and um they can just sit
there<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:58.000> kind<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.539> gives<00:01:58.780> a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
there and you see it kind of gives a

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.399 
there and you see it kind of gives a
cushion<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.920> little<00:02:00.189> bit
