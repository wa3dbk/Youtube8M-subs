good<00:03:27.790> m<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.230> look<00:03:29.380> at<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.620> picture<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
good m if you look at the picture on the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.030 
good m if you look at the picture on the
other<00:03:30.430> side<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.359> wool<00:03:31.599> really<00:03:32.139> makes<00:03:32.440> deep

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
other side the wool really makes deep

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.129 
other side the wool really makes deep
back<00:03:33.340> good<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.000> you're<00:03:34.209> not<00:03:34.239> really<00:03:35.019> using

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
back good but you're not really using

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.270 
back good but you're not really using
move<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.180> that's<00:03:37.180> not<00:03:37.329> really<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.660> thing<00:03:37.780> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
move so that's not really a thing you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.470 
move so that's not really a thing you
you<00:03:39.459> can<00:03:40.150> consider<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.990> be<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.590> know

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
you can consider to be you know

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.790 
you can consider to be you know
considered<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.780> be<00:03:43.930> really<00:03:44.350> important

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
considered to be really important

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.230 
considered to be really important
because<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.220> just<00:03:45.490> don't<00:03:45.640> use<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.120> much

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
because you just don't use it that much

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.330 
because you just don't use it that much
but<00:03:46.990> if<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.230> make<00:03:47.410> houses<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.220> will

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
have to remember that but if you look at

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400 
have to remember that but if you look at
this<00:05:51.460> it<00:05:51.790> really<00:05:52.060> looks<00:05:52.300> solid<00:05:52.480> I'm<00:05:52.930> not<00:05:53.230> bad

at<00:05:53.560> all<00:05:53.700> don't<00:05:54.700> get<00:05:54.910> too<00:05:55.210> close<00:05:55.390> to<00:05:55.660> the

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
at all don't get too close to the

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.190 
at all don't get too close to the
textures<00:05:56.530> but<00:05:56.710> that's<00:05:57.210> that's<00:05:58.210> because<00:05:59.050> it's

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
textures but that's that's because it's

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.670
