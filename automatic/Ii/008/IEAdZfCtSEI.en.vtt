hi<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.500> my<00:00:01.800> guide<00:00:02.070> while<00:00:02.399> thyssen<00:00:02.820> all

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:03.859 
hi this is my guide while thyssen all

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.260 
hi this is my guide while thyssen all
everybody<00:00:04.859> knows<00:00:05.130> about<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.520> lowest<00:00:06.060> note

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
everybody knows about the lowest note

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.330 
everybody knows about the lowest note
will<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:06.899> flat<00:00:07.519> normally<00:00:09.920> and<00:00:10.920> then<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.190> go

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
will be flat normally and then you go

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:21.010 
will be flat normally and then you go
all<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.670> way<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.910> high

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.450 

then<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.440> few<00:00:22.619> notes<00:00:22.800> about<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.279> can

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
then there are a few notes about you can

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490 
then there are a few notes about you can
go<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.060> any<00:00:24.270> instrument<00:00:24.599> infinitely<00:00:25.230> high

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
go on any instrument infinitely high

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.999 
go on any instrument infinitely high
after<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.610> certain<00:00:26.820> point<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.270> can't<00:00:27.480> hear<00:00:27.750> it

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
after a certain point you can't hear it

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.700 
after a certain point you can't hear it
so<00:00:29.009> then<00:00:29.189> after<00:00:29.490> f<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> f<00:00:30.240> sharp<00:00:30.270> then<00:00:30.810> G<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.259> G

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
so then after f is f sharp then G then G

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:50.240 
so then after f is f sharp then G then G
sharp<00:00:31.980> than<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:45.860> that's<00:00:46.860> G<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.769> one<00:00:49.769> octave

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
sharp than a that's G of one octave

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.930 
sharp than a that's G of one octave
above<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.670> team<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> would<00:00:53.609> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
played is two octaves above this one so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.470 
played is two octaves above this one so
you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:06.960> infinitely<00:01:07.320> high<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.150> about

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
you can go infinitely high that is about

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.120 
you can go infinitely high that is about
the<00:01:09.540> highest<00:01:09.990> note<00:01:10.200> you'll<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> never<00:01:10.770> need

to play so for f sharp there are two

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.530 
to play so for f sharp there are two
ways<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:16.159> play<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.370> F<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.940> alternate<00:01:18.390> f

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
ways you play the F the alternate f

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.039 
ways you play the F the alternate f
fingering<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.090> key<00:01:21.509> above<00:01:21.780> be

natural<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.240> hit<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> side<00:01:24.990> B

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
natural and then you hit this side B

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.219 
natural and then you hit this side B
flat<00:01:25.530> key<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.149> way<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.329> plying<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.899> so

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.670 
hand part on my own it's a little flat
but<00:03:03.549> G<00:03:04.549> sharp<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:05.030> pretty<00:03:05.239> hard<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.500> play

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
but G sharp is pretty hard you can play

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.559 
but G sharp is pretty hard you can play
it<00:03:06.709> too<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:08.830> join<00:03:09.830> too<00:03:10.360> there's<00:03:11.360> way<00:03:11.540> I

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
it too and to join too there's way I

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.559 
it too and to join too there's way I
play<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:15.440> pretty<00:03:15.590> difficult<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.099> hit<00:03:16.569> so

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
play it it's pretty difficult to hit so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.870 
play it it's pretty difficult to hit so
there's<00:03:18.080> also<00:03:18.230> another<00:03:18.440> way<00:03:18.760> remember<00:03:19.760> that

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
there's also another way remember that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.460 
there's also another way remember that
alternate<00:03:20.630> gee<00:03:20.900> whiz<00:03:21.459> 13<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.760> 3<00:03:23.060> add<00:03:23.330> one<00:03:24.290> and

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
alternate gee whiz 13 and 3 add one and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.500 
alternate gee whiz 13 and 3 add one and
this<00:03:25.400> side<00:03:25.790> see<00:03:26.390> that's<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.290> one<00:03:28.269> sing<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.299> so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
this side see that's that one sing it so

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.970 
this side see that's that one sing it so
it<00:03:29.660> might<00:03:29.900> also<00:03:29.930> be<00:03:30.200> B<00:03:30.380> flat<00:03:30.590> with<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.829> in<00:03:30.890> a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
it might also be B flat with a in a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.949 
it might also be B flat with a in a
second<00:03:32.019> it's<00:03:33.019> see<00:03:35.620> yep<00:03:36.620> see<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:38.239> hard<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.630> a

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
second it's see yep see that's hard to a

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.970 
second it's see yep see that's hard to a

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
can add any of the lower piece to it but

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.559 
can add any of the lower piece to it but
I<00:03:45.980> recommend<00:03:46.609> just<00:03:46.790> trying<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.060> see<00:03:47.209> how<00:03:47.359> in

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
keys which would be flat

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.040 
keys which would be flat
I<00:04:37.199> mean<00:04:37.469> normal<00:04:37.979> register<00:04:38.340> be<00:04:38.550> flat<00:04:38.939> but<00:04:39.210> bring

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
I mean normal register be flat but bring

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.559 
I mean normal register be flat but bring
it<00:04:40.139> up<00:04:40.199> a<00:04:40.289> little<00:04:40.409> higher<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.620> be<00:04:40.860> seen<00:04:44.240> C<00:04:45.240> sharp

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
it up a little higher to be seen C sharp

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.379 
it up a little higher to be seen C sharp
if<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.590> use<00:04:46.620> this<00:04:46.949> fingering<00:04:47.430> would<00:04:47.999> add<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
if you use this fingering would add the

00:04:48.389 --> 00:05:02.959 
if you use this fingering would add the
side<00:04:48.599> seiki<00:04:55.819> see<00:04:56.819> that<00:04:56.999> PI<00:04:57.270> 1<00:05:01.789> it's<00:05:02.789> pretty

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
side seiki see that PI 1 it's pretty

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.869 
side seiki see that PI 1 it's pretty
difficult<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.389> hit<00:05:03.509> if<00:05:04.259> you<00:05:04.439> can<00:05:04.590> get<00:05:04.710> see<00:05:04.979> but

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
difficult to hit if you can get see but

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.909 
difficult to hit if you can get see but
another<00:05:06.090> good<00:05:06.330> fingering<00:05:06.749> is<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.259> equal<00:05:07.529> is

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
another good fingering is that equal is

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.610 
another good fingering is that equal is
playing<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.490> like<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.879> natural<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:10.050> side<00:05:10.319> here
