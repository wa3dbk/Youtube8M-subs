basically you're gonna push the rivet
through<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:24.900> hole<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.390> put<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
through the hole and you just put the

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.800 
through the hole and you just put the
cap<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:29.040> rivet<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:30.450> rivet

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.580 
snap one more now these are super strong
I<00:02:38.849> wouldn't<00:02:39.599> worry<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.200> coming<00:02:40.379> apart

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
I wouldn't worry about it coming apart

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.720 
I wouldn't worry about it coming apart
the<00:02:41.340> key<00:02:41.639> is<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.359> do<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.599> smaller<00:02:43.079> hole<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.459> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the key is to do a smaller hole so that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.460
