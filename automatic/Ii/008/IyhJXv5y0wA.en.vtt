solve<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.440> basically<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
solve what these are basically a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
solve what these are basically a
double-ended<00:01:12.210> tip<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.689> each<00:01:13.229> color<00:01:13.649> so<00:01:14.009> you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
double-ended tip on each color so you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.740 
double-ended tip on each color so you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
can either pull off the cap and get a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
can either pull off the cap and get a
pen<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.860> twist<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> end<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
pen or you can twist the end and you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
pen or you can twist the end and you
just<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> nail<00:01:22.020> polish<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.610> blue<00:01:23.880> here
