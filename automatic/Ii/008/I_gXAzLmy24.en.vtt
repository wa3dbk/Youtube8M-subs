00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.170
 criminal cases in general the same analysis

 5 organized crime activities 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.920
 groups the police and is part of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.990
 Russian society has developed and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.640
 there is a lot to develop with it 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.050
 reasons to be proud of the activity 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.270
 police officers 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.740
 who stand guard over the law and in 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.520
 peaceful days provide public 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.350
 the order 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.360
 and during armed conflicts and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.920
 emergency situations risking your 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.890
 life protect state 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.630
 the independence and sovereignty of the country giving 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.799
 assessment of the activities of the Interior Ministry head of the republic 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.320
 noted increased confidence 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.750
 I turn to the police officers 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 when the republic can certainly say 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 rate it well and well i think that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.680
 a dozen assessment can only put 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.860
 our population is not no secret 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.610
 what is today among the population 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.500
 Karachay-Cherkess relations 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.000
 police officers themselves system in 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.740
 Overall, it has noticeably improved but also 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.420
 This is the main criterion for evaluation. 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.300
 estimate of course the population and our 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.650
 public but at the same time us in 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.350
 I throw new challenges with us I consider 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.900
 what is the socio-economic situation 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.350
 Republic is improving and in general dynamically 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.030
 developing what is leading 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.890
 certain reinforcement work 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.520
 law enforcement agencies and authorities 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.270
 power and security 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.040
 so that she does not do power so as not to 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.140
 did law enforcement structures 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.790
 population estimate will still be more 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.620
 demanding and should be to these 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.110
 a challenge 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.490
 ready but I repeat once again and convinced 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.180
 this is what we are all prepared for 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.030
 a lot of sensitive issues 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.270
 but they are not noticed and do not remain 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.000
 the leadership of the Interior Ministry and you sat on the spot 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:06.970
 you are working on these issues 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.190
 Of course it is very pleasant, I think it is 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.900
 the most important indicator that personal 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.440
 composition of the people of Karachai-Circassian 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:22.600
 Republic did not suffer losses in 2014 and 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.680
 so that further lasted with
