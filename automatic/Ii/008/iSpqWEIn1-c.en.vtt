00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.870
 for a new video for this Monday 18 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.799
 november 2013 2 degrees out so the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.990
 theme of the week and you father 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.560
 our to show you our rich list 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.020
 of Christmas 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 so you'll say yes sarko little word 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 wii therefore knowledgeable in fact we 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.449
 had the idea a long time ago 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 about two weeks we already had 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 the theme of childhood for the week 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.090
 last so we decided to do it 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.620
 this week so I wanted to I you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.840
 shows the message but hey I do not think so 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 that's necessary observation if you 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 think that we have confided with who you are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 there anyway it's 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 maybe all periods loss 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.539
 is it still great 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.230
 interesting to know what are our 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.879
 ideas for gifts for this year 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.780
 for this christmas 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.120
 simply because it can you 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.590
 give ideas so I think it smells 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 not me and it's a theme that I like 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.770
 Verry much 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.090
 so I immediately started with yes 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.780
 tell you my wishlist - you know 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.320
 that in fact I am I was born on the 23rd 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.000
 December 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.070
 so I'm about as of a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 I was born on the 23rd 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 December so it's close to Christmas 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.299
 a lot I ask you a lot of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.729
 gifts so first of all I ask 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.460
 a pair of shoes so these are 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.860
 those here so here you go tell me 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.060
 maybe it's too weak or 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.530
 to be too much at heel anything but 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.470
 good after I have these opinions me I the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.799
 adore and so your liban from where then I 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.159
 ask the team 3 who is he going 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.750
 go out or not brief van dyck puppies 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.490
 and because I find her beautiful and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.619
 I really wanted to see her 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.850
 maybe asked for lighting but I 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.439
 do not know too much 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.509
 lights for videos because 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.100
 you see that there is light in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.140
 my office and even though it's pretty 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.969
 strong hot it's a light a little 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.710
 yellow and I will ask head of a 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.119
 other land of bugs but I'm not sure 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.290
 because I already have one I do not know 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.700
 actually the problem show you it's 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.290
 surely in fact or if in fact it did 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.099
 that and I do not like anything too 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 germinate in having no button so guen 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.099

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 the same hÃ©rault shoes clothes 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.340

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.990
 money because I had other 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.870
 what we do today we are rich 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.480
 track with mezzanine here I would like 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.470
 also have 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.250
 yes I have lots of ideas but there is my 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.570
 friend late and my christmas so voila 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.950
 I wish I did not know if I 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.350
 will ask timberland what I know 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.520
 not even okay or not so I'm going 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.570
 see but still three pairs of 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.459
 shoes is doing a lot in our 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.959
 choice is a choice in all this ah yes 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.190
 maybe also to open tongs 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.560
 piknics but when she buys herself on 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.050
 internet that shows maybe but 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.340
 buy with the money I had that 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.900
 I received Christmas but I'm not sure 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.280
 to take them again even though they are 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.019
 too well I have a nice brushstroke for 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.310
 the complexion and for the places do not 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.640
 beam to progress to do it I would have 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.970
 a lot 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.360
 so here and if not 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 close everything and is also a mic for my 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 camera but I still not sure 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.160
 so I'm sure of nothing for my 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.239
 gifts during this time and that's it 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.850
 see banned then we decided actually 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.540
 to do a little questionnaire like 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.430
 for halloween 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.230
 but it's possible it's for christmas 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.350
 so the first question is your 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.049
 favorite Christmas dish so me it's without 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.660
 foie gras hesitation that his way 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.209
 Mom always asks me what is that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.370
 you want as a menu so I ask 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:51.730
 small brioche grill and finally 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.040
 grilled or kpop with it must be on 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.950
 and it's just the perfection of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.950
 Christmas here and I'm not too buch 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:08.110
 I do not have that much anyway I like 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.920
 a lot of weight the hedge 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.700

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.609
 favorite of christmas tupac second 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.630

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.550

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:29.200

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.530

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.330

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.470

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.210
