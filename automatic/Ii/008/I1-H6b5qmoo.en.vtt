00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
to do that then using a submarine it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.150 
to do that then using a submarine it
makes<00:03:30.800> a<00:03:30.890> lot<00:03:31.040> of<00:03:31.070> sense<00:03:31.160> um<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.570> just<00:03:32.630> said
