got<00:01:58.170> past<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.890> we're<00:01:59.010> pretty<00:01:59.130> good<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.490> go

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
got past that so we're pretty good to go

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.230 
got past that so we're pretty good to go
of<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> things<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.729> kill<00:02:02.970> me<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.150> this

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
of all the things that kill me in this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.000 
of all the things that kill me in this
game<00:02:03.390> those<00:02:03.600> tiny<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:03.960> bullets<00:02:04.500> kill<00:02:04.890> me

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
game those tiny little bullets kill me

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.400 
game those tiny little bullets kill me
more<00:02:05.159> than<00:02:05.280> anything<00:02:05.490> else

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
more than anything else

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.540 
more than anything else
because<00:02:08.410> they're<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:08.679> fast<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.399> don't

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
because they're so fast and you don't

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.150 
because they're so fast and you don't
see<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.380> anyway<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.410> guess<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.890> like<00:02:12.040> my

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
see it anyway I guess this is like my

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.780

honest I'm not either actually played a
bit<00:03:38.790> there's<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:39.800> don't<00:03:40.800> know<00:03:40.980> it's<00:03:41.670> just

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
bit there's like I don't know it's just

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.250 
bit there's like I don't know it's just
maybe<00:03:42.060> maybe<00:03:42.300> I'm<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.630> really<00:03:42.870> picky<00:03:43.080> or

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
maybe maybe I'm just really picky or

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.350 
maybe maybe I'm just really picky or
something<00:03:43.710> but<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.040> seems<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.180> much

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
something but it seems like so much

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.610 
something but it seems like so much
better<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.810> cluttered

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
better so cluttered

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.010 
better so cluttered
especially<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> clown<00:03:47.700> man<00:03:47.970> stages<00:03:48.840> stuff

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
especially the clown man stages stuff

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.440 
especially the clown man stages stuff
all<00:03:49.170> over<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.470> screen<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.060> almost<00:03:51.270> like

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
all over the screen and it's almost like

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.790 
all over the screen and it's almost like
the<00:03:51.540> programmers<00:03:52.110> when<00:03:52.290> they<00:03:52.410> made<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
the programmers when they made that

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.320 
the programmers when they made that
stage<00:03:53.070> that's<00:03:53.400> like<00:03:53.580> they<00:03:53.700> knew<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.240> was

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
stage that's like they knew that it was

actually<00:04:51.370> though<00:04:51.850> probably<00:04:52.720> out<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.020> all<00:04:53.230> the

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
actually though probably out of all the

levels in the game level two is the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.570 
levels in the game level two is the
easiest<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.810> not<00:04:56.020> die<00:04:56.230> in<00:04:56.470> if<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.340> know<00:04:57.460> what

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
you're doing what I like to do is start

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.060 
you're doing what I like to do is start
down<00:05:00.130> here<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.640> lower<00:05:00.820> left<00:05:01.030> corner<00:05:02.070> that

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
down here in the lower left corner that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.390 
down here in the lower left corner that
way<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.370> have<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:05.350> know<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:06.010> at<00:05:06.100> least<00:05:06.220> get

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
way you have you know you at least get

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.940 
way you have you know you at least get
one<00:05:06.430> power<00:05:06.730> of<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.030> start<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.540> then<00:05:08.080> go<00:05:08.800> from

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
one power of the start and then go from

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.220 
one power of the start and then go from
there<00:05:09.160> whatever<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.730> gotta<00:05:09.880> do<00:05:10.080> these<00:05:11.080> guys

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
there whatever you gotta do these guys

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.900 
there whatever you gotta do these guys
have<00:05:11.290> different<00:05:11.530> patterns<00:05:12.040> like<00:05:12.490> one<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.820> them

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
have different patterns like one of them

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.300 
have different patterns like one of them
I<00:05:13.180> think<00:05:13.270> it's<00:05:13.480> this<00:05:13.630> one<00:05:13.900> won't<00:05:14.890> come<00:05:15.130> out

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
I think it's this one won't come out

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.050 
I think it's this one won't come out
until<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:16.450> actually<00:05:17.220> turn<00:05:18.220> away<00:05:18.370> from<00:05:18.520> him<00:05:18.880> or

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
until you actually turn away from him or

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.310 
until you actually turn away from him or
you<00:05:19.150> can<00:05:19.180> just<00:05:19.360> walk<00:05:19.540> past<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.200> that

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
you can just walk past and so that

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.810 
you can just walk past and so that
you're<00:05:20.410> facing<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.830> other<00:05:20.920> way<00:05:21.040> I'm<00:05:21.580> gonna

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820
