world<00:00:11.420> take<00:00:12.420> both<00:00:12.599> your<00:00:12.750> poi<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.280> we're<00:00:14.280> gonna

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
world take both your poi and we're gonna

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.520 
world take both your poi and we're gonna
go<00:00:14.610> through<00:00:14.910> something<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:16.020> think<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
go through something that I think is

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.370 
go through something that I think is
very<00:00:16.770> high<00:00:17.040> on<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.460> list<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:18.030> very<00:00:18.960> important

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
very high on the list of very important

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.040 
very high on the list of very important
fundamentals<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:20.939> open<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.869> poi

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
fundamentals that will open up poi

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.640 
fundamentals that will open up poi
spinning<00:00:22.349> for<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.880> learning<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
spinning for you and that's learning to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
spinning for you and that's learning to
reverse<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.980> poi<00:00:26.310> while<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> other<00:00:26.910> keeps

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
reverse one poi while the other keeps

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.650 
reverse one poi while the other keeps
spinning<00:00:28.160> which<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.369> ultimately<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.449> means

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
spinning which it ultimately just means

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.100 
spinning which it ultimately just means
having<00:00:30.900> control<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:33.030> different<00:00:33.480> ation<00:00:33.930> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
having control of the different ation of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
having control of the different ation of
your<00:00:34.890> right<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.460> left<00:00:35.520> poi<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.360> can

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
your right and your left poi so it can

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
your right and your left poi so it can
be<00:00:36.570> reversing<00:00:37.020> employee<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.160> long<00:00:38.370> grind

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
be reversing employee in the long grind

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
be reversing employee in the long grind
it<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.850> also<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.570> bigger<00:00:39.780> or

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it can also just be going bigger or

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.040 
it can also just be going bigger or
slower<00:00:40.890> than<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> other<00:00:41.700> poi<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.420> even

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
slower than the other poi or even

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.100 
slower than the other poi or even
reversing<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> changing<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.219> planes

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
reversing and changing the planes

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.910 
reversing and changing the planes
compared<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> other<00:00:46.410> play<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:46.770> we're

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
compared to the other play but we're

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
compared to the other play but we're
going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> start<00:00:47.370> simple<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.600> take<00:00:48.780> both<00:00:48.930> your

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
going to start simple so take both your

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.400 
going to start simple so take both your
play<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:51.210> gonna<00:00:51.329> build<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.230> what

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
play and we're gonna build up from what

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
play and we're gonna build up from what
we<00:00:52.530> already<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.820> feeling<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
we already know which is the feeling of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.209 
we already know which is the feeling of
reversing<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> spin<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:55.770> right<00:00:55.949> boy

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
reversing so if you spin your right boy

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.560 
reversing so if you spin your right boy
you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.329> stall<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.109> reverse<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.390> stall<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570

you can stall it and reverse it stall it
and<00:01:00.719> reverse<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.769> it<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> few<00:01:02.039> times<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and reverse it and do it a few times and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.260 
and reverse it and do it a few times and
really<00:01:03.420> notice<00:01:03.870> how<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.270> what's

so right plus hanging then you get it
wobbling<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.340> rocking<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.179> then<00:02:11.489> swinging

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
wobbling then rocking and then swinging

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.140 
wobbling then rocking and then swinging
this<00:02:14.410> might<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:14.709> be<00:02:15.099> this<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.700> make<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.030> look

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
this might not be this I make this look

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.000 
this might not be this I make this look
easy<00:02:16.300> but<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.930> might<00:02:17.349> find<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.709> not<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:17.980> easy

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
easy but you might find it's not so easy

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.979 
easy but you might find it's not so easy
that<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:18.640> soon<00:02:18.760> as<00:02:18.880> they<00:02:18.970> get<00:02:19.060> swinging<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
that as soon as they get swinging the

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.650 
that as soon as they get swinging the
channels<00:02:20.440> get<00:02:20.650> confused<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.540> all

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
channels get confused and and it all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.000 
channels get confused and and it all
messes<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.170> that's<00:02:23.319> okay<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.709> come<00:02:23.860> back

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
messes up and that's okay just come back

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.400 
messes up and that's okay just come back
to<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.459> few<00:02:24.910> times<00:02:25.030> today<00:02:25.299> maybe<00:02:26.200> tomorrow

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
to it a few times today maybe tomorrow

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.120 
to it a few times today maybe tomorrow
it<00:02:27.190> might<00:02:27.310> take<00:02:27.519> a<00:02:27.549> couple<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:28.920> then<00:02:29.920> we're

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
it might take a couple this then we're

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.000 
it might take a couple this then we're
the<00:02:30.519> boys<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.750> get<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.989> right<00:02:32.200> poi<00:02:32.470> spinning

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the boys so get the right poi spinning

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.840 
the boys so get the right poi spinning
and<00:02:33.549> you're<00:02:34.269> learning<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> left<00:02:35.170> boy

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and you're learning it to the left boy

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.660 
and you're learning it to the left boy
rocking<00:02:36.850> until<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:37.989> swinging<00:02:38.950> front<00:02:39.580> to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
rocking until it's swinging front to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.080 
rocking until it's swinging front to
back

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.339 

so<00:02:45.690> once<00:02:46.140> you've<00:02:46.890> got<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.160> with<00:02:47.310> both<00:02:47.489> poi

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
so once you've got that with both poi

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.750 
so once you've got that with both poi
let's<00:02:49.349> return<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.739> where<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.040> started<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
let's return to where we started so the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.630 
let's return to where we started so the
left<00:02:51.120> point<00:02:51.450> spinning<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:52.800> poi<00:02:53.190> is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
left point spinning the right poi is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.740 
left point spinning the right poi is
swinging<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:55.550> notice<00:02:56.550> there's<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.330> time

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
swinging and notice there's that time

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.250 
swinging and notice there's that time
when<00:02:58.050> they're<00:02:58.230> kind<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.470> both<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.650> forwards

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
when they're kind of both going forwards

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.350 
when they're kind of both going forwards
forwards<00:03:01.400> from<00:03:02.400> there<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.849> can<00:03:03.030> get<00:03:03.209> them

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
forwards from there you can get them

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.160 
forwards from there you can get them
both<00:03:03.540> spinning<00:03:04.110> forwards<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:06.510> try<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> let

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
both spinning forwards then try to let

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.370 
both spinning forwards then try to let
the<00:03:07.260> right<00:03:07.470> poi<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:08.040> go<00:03:08.660> back<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:10.230> hang

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
the right poi just go back to just hang

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.870 
the right poi just go back to just hang
and<00:03:10.560> if<00:03:10.680> they<00:03:10.800> both<00:03:10.980> mess<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.459> don't<00:03:11.670> worry

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
and if they both mess up don't worry

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.750 
and if they both mess up don't worry
just<00:03:12.090> get<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> left<00:03:13.140> going<00:03:13.410> again<00:03:13.650> get<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
just get the left going again get the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.809 
just get the left going again get the
right<00:03:14.940> playback<00:03:15.390> back<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.989> swing<00:03:16.730> until<00:03:17.730> you

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
right playback back to swing until you

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.280 
right playback back to swing until you
can<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.060> from<00:03:18.299> swinging<00:03:18.810> into<00:03:19.140> both<00:03:20.040> forwards

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
can go from swinging into both forwards

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.660 
can go from swinging into both forwards
Boehner<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.769> other<00:03:22.920> way<00:03:23.100> where<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> right

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
Boehner do the other way where the right

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.229 
Boehner do the other way where the right
is<00:03:23.910> spinning<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:25.290> left<00:03:25.790> gets<00:03:26.790> swinging

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
is spinning and the left gets swinging

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.979 
is spinning and the left gets swinging
until<00:03:27.930> they're<00:03:28.170> both<00:03:28.560> going<00:03:29.160> forwards<00:03:29.989> okay

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
until they're both going forwards okay

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.729 
until they're both going forwards okay
so<00:03:31.349> see<00:03:31.560> how<00:03:31.620> we're<00:03:32.010> building<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:33.739> then

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
so see how we're building this up then

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.250 
so see how we're building this up then
you're<00:03:34.890> gonna<00:03:35.010> do<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.660> get<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> left<00:03:37.019> poi

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
you're gonna do this get the left poi

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.470 
you're gonna do this get the left poi
spinning<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:39.420> right<00:03:39.750> boy<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.349> swinging

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
spinning the right boy you got swinging

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.370 
spinning the right boy you got swinging
this<00:03:42.480> brings<00:03:42.780> up<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.930> front<00:03:43.580> up<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.849> front<00:03:45.380> up

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
this brings up the front up the front up

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.410 
this brings up the front up the front up
the<00:03:46.650> front<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> backwards<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.940> they're

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
the front in the backwards and they're

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.660 
the front in the backwards and they're
going<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.720> opposite<00:03:49.170> directions<00:03:49.230> now<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.400> is

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
going in opposite directions now this is

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
going in opposite directions now this is
probably<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.269> lot<00:03:51.359> of<00:03:51.420> people<00:03:51.630> this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
probably this for a lot of people this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.069 
probably this for a lot of people this
will<00:03:51.840> be<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.019> hardest<00:03:52.230> part<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.930> might

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
will be the hardest part so you might

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.840 
will be the hardest part so you might
have<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.230> keep<00:03:55.380> building<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:56.459> try<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.670> just

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
have to keep building up so try it just

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.410 
have to keep building up so try it just
the<00:03:57.030> right<00:03:57.209> toy<00:03:57.480> swing<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.910> swings<00:03:59.910> up<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the right toy swing and swings up the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.259 
the right toy swing and swings up the
front<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.870> go<00:04:00.989> backwards<00:04:01.350> do<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.799> few<00:04:02.010> times

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
front to go backwards do a few times

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.750 
front to go backwards do a few times
swings<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.780> swings<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.560> swings<00:04:04.859> up<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.640> go

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
swings and swings it swings up to go

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.589 
swings and swings it swings up to go
backwards

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
backwards

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.509 
backwards
so<00:04:08.109> maybe<00:04:08.439> you<00:04:08.530> have<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.739> rehearse<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.219> 10

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
so maybe you have to rehearse it 10

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.170 
so maybe you have to rehearse it 10
times<00:04:10.499> left<00:04:11.499> boys<00:04:11.769> spinning<00:04:12.219> forwards<00:04:12.730> right

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.390 
you do all kinds of funny patterns it
the<00:06:32.000> sky's<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.270> limit<00:06:33.130> we're<00:06:34.130> gonna<00:06:34.220> come

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
the sky's the limit we're gonna come

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.980 
the sky's the limit we're gonna come
back<00:06:34.430> to<00:06:34.580> this<00:06:34.730> over<00:06:35.060> and<00:06:35.180> over<00:06:35.450> because<00:06:35.660> it's

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
back to this over and over because it's

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.960 
back to this over and over because it's
not<00:06:36.140> only<00:06:36.350> this<00:06:36.590> just<00:06:36.770> open<00:06:37.490> up<00:06:37.580> moves

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
not only this just open up moves

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.750 
not only this just open up moves
patterns<00:06:38.390> and<00:06:38.570> tricks<00:06:39.070> it<00:06:40.070> also<00:06:40.310> makes

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
patterns and tricks it also makes

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.730 
patterns and tricks it also makes
everything<00:06:41.150> else<00:06:41.420> easier<00:06:42.050> to<00:06:42.320> learn<00:06:42.470> because

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
everything else easier to learn because

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.590 
everything else easier to learn because
if<00:06:42.980> you<00:06:43.070> can<00:06:43.250> tell<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.760> left-hand<00:06:44.150> one<00:06:44.330> thing

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
if you can tell the left-hand one thing

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.790 
if you can tell the left-hand one thing
well<00:06:44.780> they<00:06:44.870> tell<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.140> right-hand<00:06:45.470> another

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
well they tell the right-hand another

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.670 
well they tell the right-hand another
thing<00:06:46.180> that<00:06:47.180> makes<00:06:47.540> the<00:06:47.660> learning<00:06:47.810> process<00:06:48.410> a

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
thing that makes the learning process a

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.070 
thing that makes the learning process a
lot<00:06:48.920> smoother<00:06:49.340> so<00:06:50.180> practice<00:06:50.600> it<00:06:50.720> it's<00:06:50.930> worth

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
lot smoother so practice it it's worth

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.740 
lot smoother so practice it it's worth
it<00:06:51.230> and<00:06:52.010> we'll<00:06:52.280> come<00:06:52.400> back<00:06:52.460> to<00:06:52.610> that<00:06:52.790> and<00:06:53.510> some

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
it and we'll come back to that and some

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.350 
it and we'll come back to that and some
lessons<00:06:53.930> later<00:06:54.200> on
