begin<00:00:08.250> with<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:09.030> see<00:00:09.269> there<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.929> area

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
begin with you see there in that area

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.890 
begin with you see there in that area
going<00:00:10.710> off<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> right<00:00:11.429> now<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.700> impact<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
going off to the right now the impact of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.340 
going off to the right now the impact of
the<00:00:13.849> impact<00:00:14.849> site<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> rocket<00:00:16.109> plumes

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the impact site of the rocket plumes

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.500 
the impact site of the rocket plumes
we're<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:16.980> panning<00:00:17.400> across<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.029> base<00:00:18.270> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
we're now panning across the base of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.710 
we're now panning across the base of
Mount<00:00:19.500> sharp<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:20.580> see<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> shadow<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.449> some<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
Mount sharp we see a shadow of some of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.759 
Mount sharp we see a shadow of some of
the<00:00:22.160> hardware<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.630> rover<00:00:24.630> itself<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:25.590> zoom

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the hardware on the rover itself we zoom

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.000 
the hardware on the rover itself we zoom
in<00:00:26.010> because<00:00:26.130> there's<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> big<00:00:27.199> gap<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.470> places

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
in because there's a big gap of places

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.950 
in because there's a big gap of places
we<00:00:29.130> did<00:00:29.279> take<00:00:29.490> pictures<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.570> gives<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
we did take pictures so this gives you a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560 
we did take pictures so this gives you a
better<00:00:31.140> view<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.800> other<00:00:32.489> tier<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.149> images

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
better view of the other tier of images

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
better view of the other tier of images
you<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:34.200> you'll<00:00:34.770> pick<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> rim<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you get you'll pick up the rim up at the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.970 
you get you'll pick up the rim up at the
very<00:00:36.120> top<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> haze<00:00:36.960> haze<00:00:37.500> shows<00:00:37.770> up

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
very top and the haze haze shows up

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.850 
very top and the haze haze shows up
pretty<00:00:38.129> well<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> color<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.350> can

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
pretty well in the in the color you can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.990 
pretty well in the in the color you can
see<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.129> slightly<00:00:41.340> different<00:00:41.760> color<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
see it's slightly different color you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
see it's slightly different color you
can<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> low<00:00:42.600> light<00:00:43.200> layer<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.770> as

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
can see it's a low light layer there as

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.979 
can see it's a low light layer there as
was<00:00:44.100> seen<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:44.550> Afghan<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
was seen in an Afghan so you can see the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.860 
was seen in an Afghan so you can see the
plumes<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.770> light<00:00:47.370> toned<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.690> could

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
plumes are light toned that's that could

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
plumes are light toned that's that could
be<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> contaminant<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.309> we

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
be a contaminant we don't know we

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.369 
be a contaminant we don't know we
probably<00:00:51.270> won't<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.719> unless<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:52.230> over

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
probably won't know unless we go over

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
probably won't know unless we go over
and<00:00:52.530> observe<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.980> things<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and observe these things this is a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.080 
and observe these things this is a
napkin<00:00:54.120> mosaic<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> upper<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
napkin mosaic and in the upper right you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020 
napkin mosaic and in the upper right you
can<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.680> main<00:00:58.890> target<00:00:59.370> area<00:00:59.699> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
can actually see the main target area of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.510 
can actually see the main target area of
where<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:01.079> want<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.219> why<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.460> chosen

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
where we want to go and why I was chosen

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
where we want to go and why I was chosen
so<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.019> Hills<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> background<00:01:05.280> at

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
so in the Hills at the background at

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.630 
so in the Hills at the background at
about<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:06.450> between<00:01:06.650> 190<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.680> 200<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
about well between 190 and 200 at the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
about well between 190 and 200 at the
degrees<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> top<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.650> these

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
degrees at the top you see these

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
degrees at the top you see these
beautiful<00:01:11.040> knowles<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.510> layered<00:01:13.170> rocks

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
beautiful knowles and of layered rocks

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.469 
beautiful knowles and of layered rocks
and<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:16.020> those<00:01:16.680> layers<00:01:16.920> are

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
and the and that is the those layers are

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
and the and that is the those layers are
what's<00:01:18.479> recording<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> history<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.920> Gale

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
what's recording the history and Gale

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.940 
what's recording the history and Gale
Crater<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.689> they<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> reasons

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
Crater and they are one of the reasons

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950 
Crater and they are one of the reasons
we<00:01:23.159> chose<00:01:23.189> Gale<00:01:23.790> Crater<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.390> main<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.930> main

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
we chose Gale Crater the main the main

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.109 
we chose Gale Crater the main the main
reason<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> study<00:01:26.040> those<00:01:26.280> rocks<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
reason is to study those rocks this is

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.600 
reason is to study those rocks this is
just<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.990> context<00:01:28.860> shot<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.189> here

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
just a kind of a context shot here here

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.649 
just a kind of a context shot here here
we<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> high<00:01:30.450> gain

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
we are that you can see the high gain

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.980 
we are that you can see the high gain
antenna<00:01:31.079> there<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
antenna there to the that's the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.330 
antenna there to the that's the
hexagonal<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.530> pointed<00:01:34.890> off<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> side

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
hexagonal thing pointed off to the side

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.440 
hexagonal thing pointed off to the side
there<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.759> behind<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.299> little

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
there and then behind it that little

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
there and then behind it that little
thing<00:01:36.689> sticking<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.979> low<00:01:38.310> gain

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
thing sticking up is the low gain

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.450 
thing sticking up is the low gain
antenna<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> rim<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
antenna and you can see the rim of the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
antenna and you can see the rim of the
crater<00:01:41.579> off<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> distance<00:01:42.810> there

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
crater off off in the distance there

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.800 
crater off off in the distance there
this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> our<00:01:43.770> deck<00:01:44.700> pan<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.600> we're<00:01:45.750> kind

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this is our deck pan and now we're kind

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.590 
this is our deck pan and now we're kind
of<00:01:45.930> zooming<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.420> here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of zooming in here and you can see here

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.789 
of zooming in here and you can see here
that<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> rad<00:01:49.500> instrument

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that that's actually the rad instrument

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
that that's actually the rad instrument
and<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> few<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.930> these<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and you can see a few of these kind of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.580 
and you can see a few of these kind of
large<00:01:53.210> large<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.450> us<00:01:54.479> pebbles<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
large large for us pebbles on the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.840 
large large for us pebbles on the
surface<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.189> those<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.399> apparently<00:01:56.700> were

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
surface and those are apparently were

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
surface and those are apparently were
kicked<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.299> by<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> by<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> landing<00:01:58.590> event

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
kicked up by the by the landing event

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
kicked up by the by the landing event
apparently<00:01:59.700> our<00:01:59.790> Mars<00:02:00.000> Lander<00:02:00.420> engines

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
apparently our Mars Lander engines

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.319 
apparently our Mars Lander engines
actually<00:02:01.290> pushed<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.040> some<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.430> this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
actually pushed up some of these this

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.510 
actually pushed up some of these this
gravel<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.320> stuff<00:02:04.680> maybe<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.460> a

gravel kind of stuff maybe up to about a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.499 
gravel kind of stuff maybe up to about a

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
centimeter in size on top the rover and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.060 
centimeter in size on top the rover and
they<00:02:09.509> pose<00:02:09.840> no<00:02:10.110> no<00:02:10.560> problem<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.520> operations
