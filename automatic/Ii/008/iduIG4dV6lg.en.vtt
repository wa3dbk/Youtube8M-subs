00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 today I saw that many of ours 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.069
 right now they are lacking right from the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.899
 psychological point of view 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 is not perhaps the case of sunset between 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.440
 the other one reduces a cold and me 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.599
 I was talking about the preparation last year 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 starting via Tramontana he had won two 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.690
 races consecutively doing great 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.369
 cup also Slavic mind 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.480
 this year perhaps the preparation was 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.760
 differentiated in view of the Olympics 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 of calgary in February is a fact that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.859
 started rather badly between damage and search 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.090
 to recover but an impression that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.070
 even today he will not make it as certainly not 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 to return to his beds cv I remember that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 the bike did not make sla placings 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 they are successful eg assisted 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.070
 they went into the slalom that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 He ushered in the season but nor 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 it seems to me that placements can come closer 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.520
 prominently featured 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.230
 last season pramotton 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 except for the black period of January 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 it nevertheless goes to the first place having done 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.390
 a good recovery our with and aside 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.910
 I immediately remember that compared to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.710
 remove blood pressure then come on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.820
 muscles and here he was alberto tomba 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.979
 for the few who did not know 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 won the first four races of this one 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.700
 season 2 slalom and two giants yesterday 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.799
 the fastest in the race 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.520
 during the first run he had watched 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.100
 five tenths on the best it had been 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.270
 never had a three-quarter race 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.189
 injury when we see her 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.450
 intermediate is administering with 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 the advantage is great prudence 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 we see his detachment from product was 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.280
 of 95 cents at this point tomb is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.280
 still ahead of the sunset 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.799
 a hint of error but its strength 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.080
 muscle allowed him to give back 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.170
 attention now very difficult time 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.390
 very difficult 23 scratches this year 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.939
 very much slowed down in tow but that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.930
 however demonstrating in a tactical sense 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.930
 awesome
