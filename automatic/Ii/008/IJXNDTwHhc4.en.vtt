00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
bro actually I've gotten this question

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.620 
bro actually I've gotten this question
thousands<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.009> times<00:00:14.219> literally<00:00:15.030> thousands

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
thousands of times literally thousands

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.480 
thousands of times literally thousands
of<00:00:15.690> times<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.770> figured<00:00:16.949> I'd<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
of times and so I figured I'd just do a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.320 
of times and so I figured I'd just do a
video<00:00:17.810> about<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.880> answer<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
video about it because I answer it and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.140 
video about it because I answer it and
then<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.900> don't<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.170> their<00:00:22.350> answer<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.769> may<00:00:22.949> be

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
then I don't have their answer it may be

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.939 
then I don't have their answer it may be
to<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> comment<00:00:24.840> every<00:00:25.109> single<00:00:25.380> time<00:00:25.619> which

counted calories for a very very long

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.830 
counted calories for a very very long
time<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.790> seems<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> work<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.689> me

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
time and that just seems to work for me

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.160 
time and that just seems to work for me
I<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.799> know

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
I just I know

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.100 
I just I know
approximately<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.590> many<00:01:31.650> calories<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.400> eat<00:01:32.610> in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
approximately how many calories I eat in

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.310 
approximately how many calories I eat in
certain<00:01:34.110> meals<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.659> seems<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
certain meals and that seems to do the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
certain meals and that seems to do the
trick<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.799> me<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.270> happened<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
trick for me if it just so happened that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
trick for me if it just so happened that
I<00:01:40.229> feel<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.009> eat<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
I feel like I need to eat more in that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.539 
I feel like I need to eat more in that
day<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.930> feel<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.439> need<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> eat<00:01:43.860> less<00:01:44.189> in

eating that at that time my carbs

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.090 
eating that at that time my carbs
generally<00:02:53.880> come<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> morning<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.769> then

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
generally come in the morning and then

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.699 
generally come in the morning and then
you<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.970> evening<00:02:57.420> before<00:02:58.110> workout

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you know in the evening before workout

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.100 
you know in the evening before workout
or<00:02:58.830> after<00:02:59.010> or<00:02:59.340> something<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.110> but

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
or after or something like that but

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.199 
or after or something like that but
generally<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:01.799> like<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.549> focus<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.970> that

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
generally I just like to focus on that

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.309 
generally I just like to focus on that
so<00:03:03.540> my<00:03:04.140> calories<00:03:05.870> obviously<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:07.019> sky<00:03:07.290> high

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
so my calories obviously go sky high

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.380 
so my calories obviously go sky high
whatever<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.130> challenges<00:03:08.760> whenever<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.239> do<00:03:09.360> a

whatever I do challenges whenever I do a

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.620 
whatever I do challenges whenever I do a
TV<00:03:09.630> show<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:10.200> I'm<00:03:10.290> doing<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.620> world<00:03:10.799> tour

TV show if I'm doing a world tour

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.150 
TV show if I'm doing a world tour
episode<00:03:12.630> which<00:03:13.049> I'm<00:03:13.230> hoping<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.860> more<00:03:13.890> of

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
episode which I'm hoping to do more of

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.470 
episode which I'm hoping to do more of
but<00:03:14.430> I'll<00:03:14.519> talk<00:03:14.700> about<00:03:14.760> soon<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:18.239> know<00:03:18.329> my

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
but I'll talk about soon you know my

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.390 
but I'll talk about soon you know my
calorie<00:03:18.870> intake<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.290> go<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.680> ten<00:03:19.920> twenty

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
calorie intake can go up to ten twenty

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.569 
calorie intake can go up to ten twenty
thousand<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.810> day<00:03:22.019> sometimes<00:03:22.950> even<00:03:23.340> more

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
thousand in a day sometimes even more

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.940 
thousand in a day sometimes even more
just<00:03:24.510> depending<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:25.049> how<00:03:25.230> much<00:03:25.350> we're<00:03:25.590> filming

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
just depending on how much we're filming

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.750 
just depending on how much we're filming
and<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.480> if<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.410> were<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.920> do<00:03:29.069> obviously<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
and so if I were to do obviously that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000 
and so if I were to do obviously that
every<00:03:30.030> day<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.480> would<00:03:30.600> have<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.319> lot<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.590> medical

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
every day I would have a lot of medical

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.430 
every day I would have a lot of medical
issues<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.700> would<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.569> going<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.900> doctor<00:03:34.410> I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
issues I would be going to doctor I

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.920 
issues I would be going to doctor I
would<00:03:34.590> look<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.489> would<00:03:35.730> there's<00:03:36.090> no<00:03:36.269> way<00:03:36.480> I'd<00:03:36.780> be

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
would look I would there's no way I'd be

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.520 
would look I would there's no way I'd be
able<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.350> contain<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.459> physique<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.060> do

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
able to contain the physique that I do

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.530 
able to contain the physique that I do
and<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:40.859> therefore<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.970> balance<00:03:42.180> it

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
and so therefore I have to balance it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.039 
and so therefore I have to balance it
and<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.680> how<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:43.829> balance<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
and this is how I balance that I I the

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.650 
and this is how I balance that I I the
part<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.970> when<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.150> time<00:03:48.389> to<00:03:48.840> work<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.380> work

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
part and when it's time to work I work

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.110 
part and when it's time to work I work
which<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.959> eating<00:03:52.650> crazy<00:03:53.250> amount<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.670> calories

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
which is eating crazy amount of calories

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.259
