technique gets if you pay attention to
how<00:00:55.129> things<00:00:55.430> feel<00:00:57.460> it's<00:00:58.460> all<00:00:58.670> about<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.000> rips

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
how things feel it's all about the rips

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.920 
how things feel it's all about the rips
not<00:00:59.809> only<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.350> I<00:01:01.010> start<00:01:01.699> my<00:01:01.910> my<00:01:02.539> training

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
not only that I start my my training

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.190 
not only that I start my my training
cycle<00:01:03.260> off<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:03.590> ten<00:01:03.770> teams<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.439> to<00:01:06.439> me<00:01:08.200> ten

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
cycle off with ten teams so to me ten

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.510 
cycle off with ten teams so to me ten
tens<00:01:09.819> develops<00:01:10.869> not<00:01:11.869> only<00:01:12.170> drive<00:01:12.619> it<00:01:13.069> develops

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
tens develops not only drive it develops

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.489 
tens develops not only drive it develops
core<00:01:13.789> strength<00:01:14.179> and<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:14.450> develops<00:01:14.990> your

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
core strength and it develops your

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.639 
core strength and it develops your
technique<00:01:16.509> so<00:01:17.509> all<00:01:17.779> three<00:01:18.079> of<00:01:18.170> those<00:01:18.289> things

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
technique so all three of those things

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.319 
technique so all three of those things
to<00:01:19.279> me<00:01:19.520> equals<00:01:20.389> your<00:01:20.630> max<00:01:20.929> at<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.679> end<00:01:21.859> of<00:01:22.039> your

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
to me equals your max at the end of your

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.359 
to me equals your max at the end of your
your<00:01:23.329> training<00:01:23.749> cycle<00:01:24.139> which<00:01:24.349> will<00:01:24.740> be<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.950> meet

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
your training cycle which will be a meet

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.609 
your training cycle which will be a meet
I<00:01:25.520> never<00:01:25.759> max<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.270> much<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.659> never<00:01:27.020> max<00:01:27.349> my

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
I never max it much I never max my

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.809 
I never max it much I never max my
trainer<00:01:27.889> I<00:01:28.039> get<00:01:28.279> close<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:28.880> my<00:01:29.209> training<00:01:29.659> but

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
trainer I get close in my training but

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.129 
trainer I get close in my training but
those<00:01:31.819> ten<00:01:32.119> tends<00:01:32.419> to<00:01:32.659> me<00:01:32.869> is<00:01:33.109> my<00:01:33.499> equal<00:01:34.359> it<00:01:35.359> it

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
those ten tends to me is my equal it it

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:39.580 
those ten tends to me is my equal it it
does<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.649> same<00:01:36.950> thing<00:01:37.459> for<00:01:37.789> me<00:01:38.119> as<00:01:38.419> as<00:01:38.779> if<00:01:39.439> I

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
does the same thing for me as as if I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.199 
does the same thing for me as as if I
was<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.189> single<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:43.130> really<00:01:43.969> think

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
was to do a single so I really think

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.800 
was to do a single so I really think
it's<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.689> real<00:01:45.049> benefit<00:01:45.919> to<00:01:45.950> me<00:01:46.340> touching<00:01:47.270> going

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's a real benefit to me touching going

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.489 
it's a real benefit to me touching going
is<00:01:47.959> something<00:01:48.919> that<00:01:49.069> really<00:01:49.249> builds<00:01:49.819> my<00:01:49.999> core

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
is something that really builds my core

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.559 
is something that really builds my core
if<00:01:51.499> I<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:51.950> maintain<00:01:52.189> that<00:01:52.520> weight<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
if I can maintain that weight and the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.309 
if I can maintain that weight and the
right<00:01:53.779> technique<00:01:54.049> for<00:01:54.679> so<00:01:54.889> many<00:01:55.039> reps<00:01:55.459> and

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
right technique for so many reps and

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.889 
right technique for so many reps and
still<00:01:57.319> stick<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.549> know<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.729> mean<00:01:58.939> that<00:01:59.689> only

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
still stick it you know I mean that only

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.839 
still stick it you know I mean that only
means<00:02:00.229> that<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.529> get<00:02:00.590> stronger<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.369> stronger<00:02:01.669> I

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
means that I get stronger and stronger I

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.149 
means that I get stronger and stronger I
can<00:02:02.149> maintain<00:02:02.389> that<00:02:02.779> Drive<00:02:03.499> I<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.799> maintain

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
can maintain that Drive I can maintain

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.080 
can maintain that Drive I can maintain
that<00:02:04.700> form<00:02:05.059> and<00:02:05.599> I<00:02:05.929> can<00:02:06.309> maintain<00:02:07.309> my<00:02:07.609> core

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that form and I can maintain my core

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.140 
that form and I can maintain my core
stability<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.979> only<00:02:10.160> means<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.729> I'm

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
stability and that only means that I'm

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.940 
stability and that only means that I'm
getting<00:02:11.659> stronger<00:02:12.110> I'm<00:02:12.469> not<00:02:12.650> getting

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
getting stronger I'm not getting

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.289 
getting stronger I'm not getting
stronger<00:02:13.219> because<00:02:13.489> I'm<00:02:13.610> doing<00:02:13.819> more<00:02:14.090> weight

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
stronger because I'm doing more weight

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.420 
stronger because I'm doing more weight
I'm<00:02:14.480> getting<00:02:14.780> stronger<00:02:15.079> because<00:02:15.349> my

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
I'm getting stronger because my

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.759 
I'm getting stronger because my
endurance<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.390> holding<00:02:18.049> that<00:02:18.170> form<00:02:18.530> and

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
endurance of holding that form and

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.589 
endurance of holding that form and
holding<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.040> technique<00:02:21.340> technique<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
holding that technique technique is

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.140 
holding that technique technique is
allowing<00:02:23.599> me<00:02:23.629> to<00:02:23.780> stay<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.500> form<00:02:25.150> longer

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
allowing me to stay in that form longer

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.880 
allowing me to stay in that form longer
with<00:02:26.510> heavier<00:02:26.930> weights<00:02:27.019> even<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.829> don't

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
with heavier weights even if I don't

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.740 
with heavier weights even if I don't
feel<00:02:28.340> heavier<00:02:28.640> weight<00:02:28.879> so<00:02:29.090> I'm<00:02:29.180> already<00:02:29.420> tired

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
feel heavier weight so I'm already tired

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.899 
feel heavier weight so I'm already tired
I'm<00:02:30.049> already<00:02:30.349> fatigued<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.069> if<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.549> can<00:02:31.730> hold

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
I'm already fatigued but if I can hold

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.789 
I'm already fatigued but if I can hold
it<00:02:32.030> together<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.599> lot<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.109> reps<00:02:33.349> then<00:02:33.620> that

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
it together with a lot of reps then that

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.830 
it together with a lot of reps then that
means<00:02:34.069> I'm<00:02:34.459> only<00:02:34.640> getting<00:02:35.030> stronger<00:02:35.359> in<00:02:35.540> that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
means I'm only getting stronger in that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.039 
means I'm only getting stronger in that
aspect<00:02:36.819> that's<00:02:37.819> how<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.120> build<00:02:38.689> and<00:02:38.959> get

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
aspect that's how I build and get

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.990 
aspect that's how I build and get
stronger<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.680> by<00:02:39.859> being<00:02:40.370> able<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.670> maintain

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
stronger it's by being able to maintain

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.059 
stronger it's by being able to maintain
that<00:02:41.329> court<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.439> uh<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
that court and that uh and that

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:52.680 
that court and that uh and that
technique<00:02:44.060> through<00:02:45.250> through<00:02:48.159> fatigue<00:02:49.159> so

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.449 

touching<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.870> going<00:02:54.319> is<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:55.190> big<00:02:55.900> big<00:02:57.459> benefit

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
touching and going is a big big benefit

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.699 
touching and going is a big big benefit
of<00:02:58.599> learning<00:02:59.599> how<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.720> keep<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.200> core<00:03:00.470> tight

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
of learning how to keep that core tight

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.399 
of learning how to keep that core tight
throughout<00:03:01.540> your<00:03:02.540> reps<00:03:03.439> and<00:03:03.739> sets<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:05.409> how

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
throughout your reps and sets and how

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.619 
throughout your reps and sets and how
reps<00:03:06.769> is<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.340> same<00:03:07.579> thing<00:03:07.909> they<00:03:08.120> both<00:03:08.329> go

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
reps is the same thing they both go

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:09.460 
reps is the same thing they both go
hand-in-hand

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
hand-in-hand

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.210 
hand-in-hand
anybody<00:03:10.340> can<00:03:10.579> do<00:03:11.230> anybody<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:12.470> do<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.920> is

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
anybody can do anybody can do it is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.580 
anybody can do anybody can do it is
harder<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.849> come<00:03:14.090> off<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.420> ground<00:03:14.720> because

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
harder to come off the ground because

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.190 
harder to come off the ground because
that's<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.189> something<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:18.079> got

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
that's just something you you just got

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.349 
that's just something you you just got
to<00:03:18.319> learn<00:03:18.439> how<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.650> do<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.220> me<00:03:21.549> me<00:03:22.549> being

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
to learn how to do and me me being

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.569 
to learn how to do and me me being
