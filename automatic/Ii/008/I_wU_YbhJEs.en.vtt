00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
hi team this is Chris Abram from go math

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.550 
hi team this is Chris Abram from go math
today<00:00:26.610> we're<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.120> to<00:00:27.180> work<00:00:27.360> on<00:00:27.540> number<00:00:27.720> 28

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
today we're going to work on number 28

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.980 
today we're going to work on number 28
on<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:29.040> FTC<00:00:29.730> elementary<00:00:30.570> teacher

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
on the FTC elementary teacher

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.150 
on the FTC elementary teacher
certification<00:00:31.290> exam<00:00:32.420> it's<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> great<00:00:33.780> problem

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
certification exam it's a great problem

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
certification exam it's a great problem
is<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.400> it<00:00:35.790> sort<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> combines<00:00:36.740> ideas<00:00:37.740> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
is it it sort of combines ideas of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
is it it sort of combines ideas of
number<00:00:38.220> sense<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.610> operations<00:00:39.150> in<00:00:39.360> algebra

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
number sense and operations in algebra

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.350 
number sense and operations in algebra
so<00:00:40.380> let's<00:00:40.590> take<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.830> look

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
so let's take a look

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.870 
so let's take a look
number<00:00:42.360> 28<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:42.989> first<00:00:43.920> day<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.250> school<00:00:44.430> a

cans<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.540> second<00:00:48.930> day<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> students

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
cans on the second day the students

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
cans on the second day the students
collected<00:00:49.890> four<00:00:50.130> soda<00:00:50.430> cans<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.150> third

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
fourth they collected sixteen each day

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.670 
fourth they collected sixteen each day
they<00:00:56.340> collected<00:00:56.820> twice<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.420> number<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.990> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
they collected twice the number on the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.570 
they collected twice the number on the
previous<00:00:59.130> day

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
previous day

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.610 
previous day
how<00:01:00.210> many<00:01:00.420> soda<00:01:00.630> cans<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.200> collect<00:01:01.500> on

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
how many soda cans will they collect on

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.810 
how many soda cans will they collect on
the<00:01:01.740> ninth<00:01:01.980> day<00:01:04.100> well<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:05.580> may

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the ninth day well one thing you may

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.999 
the ninth day well one thing you may
notice<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.690> pattern<00:01:07.560> two<00:01:08.460> four<00:01:09.330> eight

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
notice is a pattern two four eight

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.770 
notice is a pattern two four eight
sixteen<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.940> should<00:01:12.090> start<00:01:12.300> writing<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
sixteen so we should start writing that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
sixteen so we should start writing that
pattern<00:01:13.550> two<00:01:14.869> for<00:01:15.920> sick<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.190> sorry<00:01:17.700> 2<00:01:17.880> 4<00:01:18.149> 8<00:01:18.740> 2<00:01:19.740> 4

8<00:01:21.619> 16<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.790> correspond<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> days

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
8 16 and these correspond with the days

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.559 
8 16 and these correspond with the days
that<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.429> there<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.819> there<00:01:26.940> are<00:01:27.030> nine<00:01:27.240> days

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
that are there so there are nine days

days eight fourth day is 16 we're trying

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.370 
days eight fourth day is 16 we're trying
to<00:01:39.990> find<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> night<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:43.289> were<00:01:43.350> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to find the night if we were just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.859 
to find the night if we were just
looking<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.039> this<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.940> regular

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
looking at this like as a regular

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
looking at this like as a regular
numbered<00:01:46.319> cents<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.619> operation<00:01:47.190> problem<00:01:47.729> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
numbered cents an operation problem we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.639 
numbered cents an operation problem we
would<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.080> find<00:01:49.289> out<00:01:49.410> what

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
would just want to find out what

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.859 
would just want to find out what
operation<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.550> we<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.330> tells<00:01:51.600> us

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
operation are we doing and it tells us

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.680 
operation are we doing and it tells us
here<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.619> doubling<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.690> we're

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
here we're going to be doubling it we're

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.359 
here we're going to be doubling it we're
going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> find<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.440> operation<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.220> we

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
going to find out the operation that we

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.090 
going to find out the operation that we
do<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.819> from<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.509> four<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.979> get

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
do to get from two to four so to get

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
do to get from two to four so to get
from<00:01:59.340> two<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> four<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.149> double<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.110> multiply

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
from two to four I double it I multiply

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.550 
from two to four I double it I multiply
by<00:02:01.740> two<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> every<00:02:03.479> term<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.289> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
by two so every term I'm going to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
by two so every term I'm going to
continue<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.039> double<00:02:05.459> it<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.849> to<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.090> next

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
continue to double it to get to the next

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960 
continue to double it to get to the next
term<00:02:06.679> that<00:02:07.679> gets<00:02:07.860> me<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.130> four<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.789> gets

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
term that gets me to the four that gets

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.880 
term that gets me to the four that gets
me<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.240> eight<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:10.050> me<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.410> 16

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
me to the eight that's get me as with 16

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.280 
me to the eight that's get me as with 16
so<00:02:11.490> if<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.670> want<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.940> find<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.569> ninth<00:02:12.870> term

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
so if I want to find that the ninth term

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.290 
so if I want to find that the ninth term
well<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> figure<00:02:14.910> out<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
well I'm going to figure out what the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.559 
well I'm going to figure out what the
fifth<00:02:15.569> term<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.590> six<00:02:16.920> seven<00:02:17.610> eight<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
fifth term is the six seven eight and

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.339 
fifth term is the six seven eight and
nine

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
nine

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.140 
nine
so<00:02:20.310> if<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.520> continue<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:21.090> pattern<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:23.150> double

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
so if I continue this pattern I double

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.380 
so if I continue this pattern I double
it<00:02:24.209> again<00:02:24.330> I'm<00:02:24.780> gonna<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.140> 32<00:02:26.300> double<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it again I'm gonna get 32 double it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.179 
it again I'm gonna get 32 double it
again<00:02:27.770> get<00:02:28.770> 64<00:02:29.870> double<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.959> again<00:02:31.790> get<00:02:32.790> 128

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
again get 64 double it again get 128

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.059 
again get 64 double it again get 128
double<00:02:35.189> out<00:02:35.280> again

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
double out again

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.009 
double out again
there's<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.239> 2<00:02:37.569> there<00:02:37.840> we're<00:02:38.530> gonna<00:02:38.620> get<00:02:38.829> 256

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
there's a 2 there we're gonna get 256

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.390 
there's a 2 there we're gonna get 256
what<00:02:41.019> happens<00:02:41.290> when<00:02:41.469> I<00:02:41.500> double<00:02:41.859> that<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.189> one

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
what happens when I double that one one

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.319 
what happens when I double that one one
more<00:02:42.430> time<00:02:43.230> 256<00:02:44.230> times<00:02:44.680> 2<00:02:45.629> what<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:46.659> that

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
more time 256 times 2 what is that

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.589 
more time 256 times 2 what is that
512<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.489> just<00:02:51.760> by<00:02:51.969> using<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:53.500> applying

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
512 so just by using this applying

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.080 
512 so just by using this applying
doubling<00:02:55.599> each<00:02:55.920> term<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.579> could<00:02:57.700> get<00:02:57.879> to<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
doubling each term you could get to the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.390 
doubling each term you could get to the
512<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.290> could<00:02:59.439> get<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.829> answer

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
512 and you could get to the answer

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.670 
512 and you could get to the answer
pretty<00:03:01.269> straightforward<00:03:01.629> number<00:03:02.349> since<00:03:02.530> an

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
pretty straightforward number since an

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.000 
pretty straightforward number since an
operation<00:03:03.220> problem<00:03:03.730> yes<00:03:04.510> at<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.439> same<00:03:05.680> time

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
operation problem yes at the same time

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.369 
operation problem yes at the same time
you<00:03:06.819> could<00:03:06.909> also<00:03:07.120> think<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.629> this<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:07.989> terms<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
you could also think of this in terms of

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.280 
you could also think of this in terms of
algebra<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.569> think<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.810> algebra

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
algebra and when you think of algebra

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.289 
algebra and when you think of algebra
that<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.829> want<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.129> it's<00:03:12.790> always<00:03:13.090> whenever

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
that you want to it's always whenever

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.020 
that you want to it's always whenever
you<00:03:13.540> see<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> pattern<00:03:14.260> or<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> sequence<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.819> here

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
you see a pattern or a sequence so here

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.409 
you see a pattern or a sequence so here
there<00:03:16.209> definitely<00:03:16.419> is<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.750> pattern<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:18.419> you

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
there definitely is a pattern and you

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.629 
there definitely is a pattern and you
know<00:03:19.599> from<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.739> term<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.220> next<00:03:21.280> you're

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
know from one term to the next you're

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.129 
know from one term to the next you're
doubling<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.180> we<00:03:22.209> could<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.510> represented

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
doubling it we could have represented

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.860

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
day four it's 16 now if I taking an

day four it's 16 now if I taking an
algebraic<00:03:59.049> approach<00:03:59.379> I<00:03:59.739> could<00:03:59.979> say<00:04:00.159> well

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
algebraic approach I could say well

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.449 
algebraic approach I could say well
what's<00:04:00.729> the<00:04:00.819> relationship<00:04:01.359> between<00:04:01.540> x<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:02.169> y

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
what's the relationship between x and y

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.270 
what's the relationship between x and y
it<00:04:03.459> looks<00:04:03.819> like<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:05.079> number<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.560> cans<00:04:05.919> that

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
it looks like the number of cans that

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.020 
it looks like the number of cans that
you<00:04:06.400> get<00:04:06.639> Y<00:04:07.150> that's<00:04:07.840> supposed<00:04:08.169> to<00:04:08.199> be<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.349> Y<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
you get Y that's supposed to be a Y the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.649 
you get Y that's supposed to be a Y the
number<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.540> cans<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:12.900> equal<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:15.329> whatever<00:04:16.329> the

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
number of cans is equal to whatever the

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.969 
number of cans is equal to whatever the
number<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:16.959> days<00:04:17.199> are<00:04:18.570> squared<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:20.769> makes

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
number of days are squared that makes

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.689 
number of days are squared that makes
sense<00:04:21.190> if<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.240> have<00:04:22.389> one<00:04:22.750> day<00:04:22.990> one<00:04:23.590> day<00:04:23.699> sorry

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
sense if we have one day one day sorry

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.779 
sense if we have one day one day sorry
let<00:04:24.970> me<00:04:25.060> uh<00:04:25.090> let<00:04:25.530> me<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:26.710> fix<00:04:27.039> that<00:04:27.220> it's

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
let me uh let me actually fix that it's

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.719 
let me uh let me actually fix that it's
not<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.090> number<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.449> days<00:04:28.630> squared<00:04:29.490> it's<00:04:30.490> the

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
not the number of days squared it's the

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.170 
not the number of days squared it's the
number<00:04:31.090> two<00:04:32.250> raised<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.520> X<00:04:33.699> power

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
number two raised to the X power

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.990 
number two raised to the X power
ah<00:04:35.039> there<00:04:36.039> you<00:04:36.190> know<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.460> makes<00:04:36.729> more<00:04:36.940> sense

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
ah there you know that makes more sense

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.159 
ah there you know that makes more sense
now<00:04:37.479> this<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.020> much<00:04:38.259> harder<00:04:39.780> or<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:40.840> little

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
now this is a much harder or a little

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.519 
now this is a much harder or a little
bit<00:04:41.259> more<00:04:41.440> complicated<00:04:42.419> equation<00:04:43.419> than<00:04:43.630> but

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:44.529 
bit more complicated equation than but

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.240 
bit more complicated equation than but
what<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:44.800> saying<00:04:44.889> is<00:04:46.469> the<00:04:47.469> relationship

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
what it's saying is the relationship

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.530 
what it's saying is the relationship
between<00:04:48.279> x<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.210> y

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
between x and y

number of days - number of cans is
you're<00:04:52.450> gonna<00:04:52.570> take<00:04:53.140> two<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.800> square<00:04:54.130> it

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
you're gonna take two and square it

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.480 
you're gonna take two and square it
raise<00:04:54.670> it<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.150> power<00:04:55.710> now<00:04:56.710> two<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:57.370> the

raise it to that power now two to the
first<00:04:57.700> power<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:58.330> two<00:04:58.750> cans

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.630 

two<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.430> second<00:05:03.940> power<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.420> 4<00:05:04.510> cans<00:05:05.370> two<00:05:06.370> to

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
two to the second power is 4 cans two to

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.020 
two to the second power is 4 cans two to
the<00:05:06.760> third<00:05:07.000> power<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.650> eight<00:05:08.650> cans<00:05:09.040> so<00:05:09.730> we<00:05:09.850> got

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
the third power is eight cans so we got

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.670 
the third power is eight cans so we got
this<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.510> know<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.660> little<00:05:11.170> bit<00:05:11.290> harder

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
this you know a little bit harder

a little bit deeper create an

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.220 
a little bit deeper create an
input/output<00:05:34.060> chart<00:05:34.360> and<00:05:34.570> come<00:05:34.810> up<00:05:34.960> with<00:05:35.110> the

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
pattern and then we could go on into

much<00:05:40.540> more<00:05:40.780> advanced<00:05:41.080> math<00:05:41.440> so<00:05:42.400> if<00:05:42.550> you<00:05:42.640> dig<00:05:42.820> a

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
much more advanced math so if you dig a

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.520 
much more advanced math so if you dig a
little<00:05:43.030> deeper<00:05:43.450> on<00:05:43.540> these<00:05:43.660> problems<00:05:43.990> you'll

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
little deeper on these problems you'll

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.590 
little deeper on these problems you'll
get<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:44.950> some<00:05:45.220> of<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:46.090> more<00:05:46.270> intermediate

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
get to some of the more intermediate

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.230 
get to some of the more intermediate
level<00:05:47.170> math<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.710> that's<00:05:48.400> why<00:05:48.700> I<00:05:48.730> want<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.150> to

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
level math and that's why I want you to

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.960 
level math and that's why I want you to
study<00:05:49.510> them<00:05:49.750> know<00:05:50.290> the<00:05:50.500> basics<00:05:50.980> that<00:05:51.730> way<00:05:51.910> you

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
study them know the basics that way you

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.430 
study them know the basics that way you
could<00:05:52.330> push<00:05:52.570> a<00:05:52.600> little<00:05:52.780> further<00:05:52.930> if<00:05:53.410> you

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
could push a little further if you

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.150 
could push a little further if you
needed<00:05:53.740> to
