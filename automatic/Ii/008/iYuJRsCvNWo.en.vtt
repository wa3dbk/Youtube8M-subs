 on the other is this one 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.129
 Note that I'm already from Goiás almost 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.780
 configuration are the ones below that 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.149
 it's so tiny 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 I'm thinking here is is to demonstrate how 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:56.850
 Do you see that you found the UN 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:08.759
 here in the corner and 30 ac neighborhood 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:15.759
 navigation in height settings 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:17.770
 increase by 30 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.759
 this is when you open some 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.580
 thing that does not even stay in the full screen and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:30.179
 in antonio tauá hours 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.179
 me too you can do several things 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.789
 that you can put an application to 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.789
 me when you want to unlock 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.090
 here you can enable the led management 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 Light 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.070
 the application can also be counted 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 here you can change the animations 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.850
 animation of an activity that can 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.390
 put you can take put raise 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.399
 in relation to the animation activity 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:11.250
 open an animation task closes the task 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:11.250
 It's really cool if the options here 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.930
 then this animation so here when you 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.700
 Is something going to be cool? 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.959
 this way the more and can increase 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.110
 If you want to slow down, that's fine. 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.360
 parliamentarians here you can increase the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.130
 size increase speed too 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.150
 I left as soon as I arrived I found 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.150
 Keep it for this, I'll show you. 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:03:03.220
 The cool thing this way is it's a 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.950
 also anyone can do 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:12.940
 various configurations haq exiled state 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:20.650

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.930
 80 low battery and battery 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:39.190
 and if you combat your context of speed 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.770
 here so you will open the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.940
 application appears only put inside the 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:56.610
 application will show that governors and 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.610
 also by tel 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.300
 so say this turn 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.019
 It really is better that you had this 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:15.700

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:22.000

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:35.830
 tomé applications goes more ram and 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:41.440
 this battery notes 10 to stay up to date 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:44.200

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.760
 I'll leave it to you. 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.760
