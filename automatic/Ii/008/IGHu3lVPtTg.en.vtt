to uh we found that hot glue didn't work

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.680 
to uh we found that hot glue didn't work
as<00:01:57.400> well<00:01:57.670> but<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.910> definitely<00:01:58.060> still<00:01:58.480> worked

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
as well but it definitely still worked

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.660 
as well but it definitely still worked
but<00:01:59.380> we<00:01:59.470> superglue<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.190> we<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.430> held<00:02:00.610> it

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
but we superglue and we just held it

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.840 
but we superglue and we just held it
together<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:02.680> infinity<00:02:03.400> symbol

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
together so that your infinity symbol

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.660 
together so that your infinity symbol
your<00:02:04.420> jump<00:02:04.810> ring<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.200> your<00:02:05.590> leather<00:02:05.920> rope<00:02:06.460> are

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
your jump ring and your leather rope are

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
your jump ring and your leather rope are
all<00:02:06.910> on<00:02:07.270> one<00:02:07.990> all<00:02:08.800> together<00:02:08.950> now<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:09.910> now<00:02:10.119> like

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
all on one all together now so now like

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.900 
all on one all together now so now like
you're<00:02:11.200> almost<00:02:11.320> done<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:12.250> hard<00:02:12.460> part<00:02:12.490> now<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you're almost done the hard part now is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.370 
you're almost done the hard part now is
just<00:02:13.030> figuring<00:02:13.330> out<00:02:13.480> how<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> close<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.230> so

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
just figuring out how to close it so

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.590 
just figuring out how to close it so
what<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.460> did<00:02:15.640> was<00:02:15.820> we<00:02:15.850> took<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.240> slightly

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
what we did was we took a slightly

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.540 
what we did was we took a slightly
larger<00:02:16.990> jump<00:02:17.500> ring<00:02:17.740> we<00:02:17.980> ended<00:02:18.190> up<00:02:18.250> getting<00:02:18.370> a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
larger jump ring we ended up getting a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.850 
larger jump ring we ended up getting a
pack<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:19.090> bearings<00:02:19.930> assorted<00:02:20.680> yeah

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
pack of like bearings assorted yeah

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.980 
pack of like bearings assorted yeah
Michaels<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.000> he<00:02:22.090> found<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.540> was<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.690> little<00:02:22.840> bit

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
Michaels so he found it was a little bit

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.800 
Michaels so he found it was a little bit
bigger<00:02:23.200> than<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:23.500> we<00:02:23.830> first<00:02:24.040> used<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.820> we

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
bigger than the one we first used and we

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.730 
bigger than the one we first used and we
took<00:02:25.930> some<00:02:25.990> pliers<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.800> opened<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.430> up<00:02:27.550> and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
took some pliers and opened it up and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.400 
took some pliers and opened it up and
bent<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.950> one<00:02:30.160> side<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.170> kind<00:02:32.380> of

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
bent the one side in so it kind of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.250 
bent the one side in so it kind of
creates<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> little<00:02:33.460> lower<00:02:34.360> case<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.840> yeah

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
creates like a little lower case a yeah

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.680 
creates like a little lower case a yeah
that's<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.590> think<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:35.980> again<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.390> have

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
that's I think of it again so you have

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.930 
that's I think of it again so you have
like<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> little<00:02:38.860> hoop<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.370> then<00:02:39.550> kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.820> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
like a little hoop and then kind of a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.880 
like a little hoop and then kind of a
hook<00:02:40.090> once<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.230> you're<00:02:41.590> basically

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
hook once you have that you're basically

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.870 
hook once you have that you're basically
going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.100> do<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.280> same<00:02:42.460> thing<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.670> edge<00:02:42.760> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
going to do the same thing the edge of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.270 
going to do the same thing the edge of
the<00:02:42.970> other<00:02:43.090> side<00:02:43.210> which<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.720> loop<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.950> Rope

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the other side which is loop the Rope

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.240 
the other side which is loop the Rope
through<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.940> small<00:02:46.360> loop<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.350> super<00:02:48.040> glue<00:02:48.100> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
through the small loop and super glue it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.570 
through the small loop and super glue it
shut

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
shut

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.190 
shut
yeah

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.510 

when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.320> bend<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.710> into<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.220> want<00:02:56.460> to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
when you bend it into the a you want to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.160 
when you bend it into the a you want to
make<00:02:56.640> sure<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.150> kind<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.540> we're

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
make sure that it kind of like we're

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.320 
make sure that it kind of like we're
gonna<00:02:58.290> use<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> word<00:02:58.590> click<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.160> clicks<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.790> to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
gonna use the word click it clicks on to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.870 
gonna use the word click it clicks on to
the<00:03:00.810> infinity<00:03:01.560> symbol<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:02.280> want<00:03:02.460> it<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.760> be

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the infinity symbol you want it to be

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.970 
the infinity symbol you want it to be
just<00:03:03.180> tight<00:03:03.420> enough<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.260> fits<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:04.800> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
just tight enough so that it fits on to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.310 
just tight enough so that it fits on to
the<00:03:05.070> infinity<00:03:05.640> symbol<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.420> not<00:03:06.690> least<00:03:07.110> not

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the infinity symbol but not least not

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.150 
the infinity symbol but not least not
that<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.530> will<00:03:07.620> fall<00:03:07.770> off<00:03:07.800> when<00:03:08.070> you're

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that it will fall off when you're

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.590 
that it will fall off when you're
wearing<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.460> yeah<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.150> makes<00:03:09.270> sense<00:03:09.360> a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
wearing it yeah that makes sense a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.710 
wearing it yeah that makes sense a
little<00:03:09.720> experimenting<00:03:10.940> yeah<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.240> so<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
little experimenting yeah and so you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.540 
little experimenting yeah and so you
just<00:03:12.810> wrap<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.620> click<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.490> and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
just wrap it on and click it on and

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.730 
just wrap it on and click it on and
you're<00:03:15.270> good<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.420> go<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.560> this

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
you're good to go and you can do this

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.470 
you're good to go and you can do this
with<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.340> don't<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> wrap<00:03:18.000> look<00:03:18.270> you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
with if you don't like the wrap look you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.630 
with if you don't like the wrap look you
can<00:03:18.600> definitely<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.990> do<00:03:19.200> this<00:03:19.350> single<00:03:19.770> like

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
can definitely just do this single like

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.060 
can definitely just do this single like
a<00:03:20.670> single<00:03:21.120> wrap<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.870> only<00:03:22.050> wrapped<00:03:22.830> around

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
a single wrap it's only wrapped around

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.920 
a single wrap it's only wrapped around
your<00:03:23.370> wrist<00:03:23.580> once<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> normal<00:03:24.540> bracelet

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
your wrist once like a normal bracelet

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.870 
your wrist once like a normal bracelet
would<00:03:25.080> be<00:03:25.230> yeah<00:03:25.500> that's<00:03:26.160> really<00:03:26.400> cute<00:03:26.760> way<00:03:26.820> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
would be yeah that's really cute way to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.210 
would be yeah that's really cute way to
do<00:03:27.060> too<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.930> if<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.230> have<00:03:28.350> any<00:03:28.500> extra<00:03:28.860> chain

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
do too and if you have any extra chain

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.070 
do too and if you have any extra chain
around<00:03:29.340> your<00:03:29.490> house<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.700> can<00:03:29.970> also<00:03:30.180> use<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
around your house you can also use the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.380 
around your house you can also use the
jump<00:03:31.290> rings<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.860> some<00:03:32.520> pliers<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.360> of

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
jump rings and some pliers to kind of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.990 
jump rings and some pliers to kind of
maneuver<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.780> chain<00:03:34.320> version<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:35.970> can

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
maneuver a chain version and you can

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.670 
maneuver a chain version and you can
make<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.330> set<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.570> any<00:03:36.690> color<00:03:36.990> leather<00:03:37.290> or<00:03:37.590> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
make the set of any color leather or you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.860 
make the set of any color leather or you
could<00:03:37.800> do<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.040> at<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> rope<00:03:38.520> or<00:03:38.850> twine<00:03:39.300> or

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
could do it at a rope or twine or
