00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.729 
are mounted on structures much like this
one<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.519> Pavel<00:03:03.480> uses<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.079> machine<00:03:04.379> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
one and then Pavel uses the machine the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.470 
one and then Pavel uses the machine the
plastic<00:03:05.069> machine<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.549> his<00:03:05.640> father<00:03:05.849> invented

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
plastic machine that his father invented

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.990 
plastic machine that his father invented
to<00:03:07.160> create<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.930> very<00:03:09.930> dynamic<00:03:10.910> sort<00:03:11.910> of

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
to create this very dynamic sort of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.590 
to create this very dynamic sort of
bandage<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:13.609> polyethylene<00:03:14.609> strips<00:03:15.299> of

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
bandage like polyethylene strips of

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.160 
bandage like polyethylene strips of
plastic<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.950> are<00:03:17.579> then<00:03:17.790> draped<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.569> affixed

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
plastic that are then draped and affixed

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.330 
plastic that are then draped and affixed
to<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.500> frames<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.410> lead<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.799> ultimate

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
to the frames and lead to the ultimate

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:49.120 
to the frames and lead to the ultimate
sculpture<00:03:23.730> being<00:03:24.030> created

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.240 

so<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:50.300> entire<00:03:50.630> idea<00:03:51.140> of<00:03:51.380> collaboration<00:03:51.650> is

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
so this entire idea of collaboration is

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.800 
so this entire idea of collaboration is
very<00:03:52.430> important<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.940> Pavel<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:53.510> something

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
very important to Pavel it's something

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.590 
very important to Pavel it's something
that<00:03:53.930> characterizes<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:54.890> lot<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.190> his<00:03:55.310> work

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
that characterizes a lot of his work

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.040 
that characterizes a lot of his work
both<00:03:56.600> creating<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.530> team<00:03:58.450> with<00:03:59.450> him<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.900> his

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
both creating a team with him and his

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.380 
both creating a team with him and his
co-workers<00:04:00.830> who<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.430> all<00:04:01.550> come<00:04:01.760> from<00:04:01.910> Warsaw

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
co-workers who have all come from Warsaw

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.240 
co-workers who have all come from Warsaw
and<00:04:02.660> traveled<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.170> Berlin<00:04:03.500> for<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.800> show<00:04:04.010> but

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
and traveled to Berlin for the show but

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.200 
and traveled to Berlin for the show but
