00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
side so they can regulate their own body

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.580 
side so they can regulate their own body
temperature<00:01:25.000> which<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.780> very<00:01:25.960> important<00:01:26.409> for

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
temperature which is very important for

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.990 
temperature which is very important for
their<00:01:26.740> health<00:01:26.770> because<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.579> is<00:01:27.700> one<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.939> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
their health because that is one of the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.580 
their health because that is one of the
things<00:01:28.210> in<00:01:28.450> your<00:01:28.659> process<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.350> doing<00:01:29.409> this

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
three chickens without a permit and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.960 
three chickens without a permit and
that's<00:02:32.900> what<00:02:33.019> most<00:02:33.200> people<00:02:33.440> start<00:02:33.739> with<00:02:33.970> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
that's what most people start with and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.430 
that's what most people start with and
that<00:02:35.150> will<00:02:35.360> produce<00:02:35.599> in<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.989> summer<00:02:36.230> each

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
that will produce in the summer each

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.990

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
for most families so three is a good

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.430 
for most families so three is a good
starting<00:02:43.670> number<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.360> many<00:02:44.959> people<00:02:45.230> find

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
starting number but many people find

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.410 
starting number but many people find
