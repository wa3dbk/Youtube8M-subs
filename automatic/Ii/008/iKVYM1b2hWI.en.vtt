between sonic and shadow every time you
change<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.790> usually<00:02:43.910> get<00:02:44.120> 50<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.780> less

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
change you usually get 50 but the less

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.199 
change you usually get 50 but the less
health<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.360> final<00:02:47.360> hazard<00:02:47.660> has<00:02:49.000> you'll<00:02:50.000> have

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
health that final hazard has you'll have

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.850 
health that final hazard has you'll have
less<00:02:50.450> than<00:02:50.630> 50<00:02:50.959> each<00:02:51.080> time<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.709> you'll

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
less than 50 each time so then you'll

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.140 
less than 50 each time so then you'll
actually<00:02:52.040> be<00:02:52.250> sharing<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:52.849> ought<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.970> be

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
actually be sharing and we ought to be

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.280 
actually be sharing and we ought to be
swapping<00:02:53.480> them<00:02:53.660> back<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.959> forth<00:02:54.110> whenever

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290

minute they like a new interception but

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.629 
minute they like a new interception but
there's<00:04:36.229> I'm<00:04:36.530> not<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.919> shouldn't<00:04:37.250> spoil<00:04:37.490> it

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
there's I'm not I shouldn't spoil it

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.480 
there's I'm not I shouldn't spoil it
actually<00:04:38.000> oh<00:04:38.150> oh<00:04:38.800> it's<00:04:39.800> already<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.189> ending

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
actually oh oh it's already the ending

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.149 
actually oh oh it's already the ending
but<00:04:40.849> it<00:04:41.270> says<00:04:41.539> on<00:04:41.750> Wikipedia<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.800> guess<00:04:42.979> I

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
but it says on Wikipedia so I guess I

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.529 
but it says on Wikipedia so I guess I
believe<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:43.490> because<00:04:43.580> there's<00:04:43.759> a<00:04:43.819> bottom<00:04:44.150> part

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
believe it because there's a bottom part

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.209 
believe it because there's a bottom part
if<00:04:44.719> you<00:04:44.780> go<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:44.960> San<00:04:45.110> Fran's<00:04:45.379> do<00:04:45.500> battle<00:04:45.740> orsign
