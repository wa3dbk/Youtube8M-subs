00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.340
 I heard something like that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.409

 it is sharper and a bit sharp when 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:34.769
 outside the rubber is the plastic 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:38.849
 protection of the club to the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.150
 This tip she's here, you can see more. 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.239
 the more you do not have to cut it there is a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:51.239
 pliers something always cutting will go 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:56.040
 to stay more or less like this, see where 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:59.819
 There is this thread here already soldered it. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.870
 This little cookie from here is going to be the pole. 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.870
 microphone negative 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.060
 these two external pins here are the 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.310
 positive right and left poles 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.129
 You will not be able to differentiate 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.760
 the two because you cut off that 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.400
 Pontz there then what are you going to do? 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.919
 you will pass a little weld of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.709
 a pin to the other you'll get a 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.959
 neither the two 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.669
 in the upper part here it will be 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.769
 microphone positive 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.760
 in this lower part will be negative 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.730
 microphone 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.079
 suppose I've done this probe 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.790
 it will happen you will be with a 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:45.090
 microphone place right here 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:50.299
 the camera if you cut here right 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:54.599
 it will normally go into the carton 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.699
 let's suppose that this thread here is the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:03.799
 son who is greeted there at that club 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:03.799
 mike right here spent inside 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.859
 so in there 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.859
 let's suppose that it is the exhibition that he 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.319
 you're healthy you 'll be able to fit 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.930
 Wellington again will close your 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.930
 camera again to a camera quiz 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.800
 Ready you have your ong action with the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.720
 box without being stuck you do not need 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.340
 look for the original box and it will be 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.120
 using an external microphone to record 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.280
 the videos for example in my case here 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.550
 microphone on the helmet inside the helmet 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.770
 the camera outside on the outside here in the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.479
 adhesive support any time 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.550
 you want to go back to the original camera is 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.530
 just make the changes 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.750
 put a name on it, good china places 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.470
 the rail again puts the 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.659
 cover 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.659
 You'll get your original camera again.
