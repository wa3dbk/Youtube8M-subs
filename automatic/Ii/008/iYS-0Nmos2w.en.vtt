because I feel like it's important that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.370 
because I feel like it's important that
people<00:00:18.150> understand<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.230> you're

going to get when you dirt a tank and I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.660 
going to get when you dirt a tank and I
want<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> talk<00:00:22.590> about<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:22.980> these<00:00:23.100> plants<00:00:23.490> over

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
want to talk about all these plants over

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.710 
want to talk about all these plants over
here<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.740> here's<00:00:25.740> what's<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.180> dirt<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
here so here's what's up when you dirt a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.089 
here so here's what's up when you dirt a
tank<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.199> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.920> have

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
tank you know you're going to have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
tank you know you're going to have
excess<00:00:32.610> nutrients<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> water<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.050> they

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
excess nutrients in the water so they

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.319 
excess nutrients in the water so they
say<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.399> really<00:00:35.640> plant<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> heck<00:00:36.180> out

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
say to really really plant the heck out

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.090 
say to really really plant the heck out
but<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.570> say<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> say<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> plant<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> heck<00:00:37.920> out

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
but they say I say to plant the heck out

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.450 
but they say I say to plant the heck out
of<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
of it
and<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.969> works<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.600> here's<00:00:39.780> why<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.050> works

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and it works and here's why it works

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
and it works and here's why it works
because<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> plants<00:00:41.160> absorb<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.610> excess

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
because the plants absorb the excess

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.720 
because the plants absorb the excess
nutrients<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.800> these<00:00:43.950> plants<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
nutrients not all of these plants that I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420 
nutrients not all of these plants that I
put<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.230> brand<00:00:46.620> new<00:00:46.860> they've

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
put in here are all brand new they've

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.709 
put in here are all brand new they've
got<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.940> comfortable<00:00:48.270> completely

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
got they comfortable completely

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
got they comfortable completely
different<00:00:49.020> water<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.440> me<00:00:49.649> might<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.879> my

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
different water than me might be my

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.200 
different water than me might be my
water<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.250> they're<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> melt<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
water so they're going to melt and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
water so they're going to melt and
they're<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> change<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.680> you'll

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
they're going to change and if you'll

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the crypt is in sorry I don't know I

can't talk tonight and that is important
so<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.820> can't<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.299> say<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.719> crypts

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so I can't just say you know crypts

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.899 
so I can't just say you know crypts
melting<00:01:58.799> three<00:01:59.159> weeks<00:01:59.340> later<00:01:59.549> they're<00:01:59.729> better

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
melting three weeks later they're better

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.789 
melting three weeks later they're better
I<00:02:00.180> got<00:02:00.689> these<00:02:00.810> crypts<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.229> Friday<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> they're

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
I got these crypts on Friday and they're

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.319 
I got these crypts on Friday and they're
doing<00:02:01.920> fine<00:02:02.219> haven't<00:02:02.790> melted<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.180> they've

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
doing fine haven't melted and they've

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.030 
doing fine haven't melted and they've
got<00:02:03.509> new<00:02:03.689> growth

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
got new growth

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.040 
got new growth
so<00:02:05.370> see<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.550> new<00:02:05.790> growth<00:02:06.980> new<00:02:07.980> growth<00:02:09.050> new

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so see that new growth new growth new

be good so this is like you know kind of

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.910 
be good so this is like you know kind of
part<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.480> process<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.350> when<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.680> get

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
part of the process but when you get

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.780 
part of the process but when you get
going<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:27.690> get<00:03:27.810> something<00:03:28.080> going<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.470> that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
going you get something going like that

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.360 
going you get something going like that
