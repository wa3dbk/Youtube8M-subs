 find same kind of food and such 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.899

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.600
 Look, just in case the line is here. 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.640
 It's so direct without playing if it says here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 crusade here and the puppy will leave here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.939
 Look how little it is if we pick up 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.680
 also the wheats with the cow in play are 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.829
 crossing of the animals in that then the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 that we have is that the two carrots and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.970
 playing here to the ports the handle takes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.740
 We already made it, I'm not staying here anymore. 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.440
 already queued had he mentioned that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 are there then where it also adds 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.110
 this is it personal 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.940
 if we do, the system of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.310
 network history here with a dispenser that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.320
 a place where half the animals stay 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 here does not come out not is not here 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.060
 Favor is around us to come back 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.070
 for that way I did not send in 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.470
 no time you leave man I did not send 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.290
 If you leave because it's jumping, it's okay. 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 It's okay, it's kind of that without this system. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.980
 of ad stone that if you put here the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.810
 food and put it here for example 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.000
 inside the ports to play here is like 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.500
 they will automatically eat and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.730
 it got hot again then 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.430
 time you want them to cross 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 You kind of came here and pizzi already 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.110
 it was then all the time you see in you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.210
 always will have animals there for you 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.800
 being able to have food right then that helps 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.570
 pretty expensive because type does not need 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.120
 to run half way behind 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.040
 pork food and that's just having a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.410
 material that in the case of the only chicken you 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.750
 Pegasse was already can make a corral 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.100
 practically infinite then people 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.110
 so that they have enjoyed the oil of 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.209
 today is really quite simple but 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.370

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.770

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.760
 corralzinho and to be able to make some meals 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.800
 Pretty, quite enough, and baby. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.150
