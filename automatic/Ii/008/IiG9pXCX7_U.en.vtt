for measuring things out so first off
what<00:00:19.859> i<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> i<00:00:20.820> take<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.090> lot<00:00:21.420> of

what i like to do is i take a lot of
line<00:00:21.840> off<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.830> reel<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.310> cut<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> off<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
line off of the reel and cut it off of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630 
line off of the reel and cut it off of
there<00:00:24.689> because<00:00:24.960> normally<00:00:25.949> they<00:00:26.130> put<00:00:26.310> too<00:00:26.519> much

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
there because normally they put too much

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.310 
there because normally they put too much
on<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> don't<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.359> access<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.170> these

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
holes around the side so take off as

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600 
holes around the side so take off as
much<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.619> need<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.040> order<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> have

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
access to those holes on the side when

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.100 
access to those holes on the side when
it's<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.770> wound<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.550> then<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.079> other

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's all wound up and then the other

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
it's all wound up and then the other
thing<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.620> good<00:00:37.920> too<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.670> measure<00:00:39.180> out

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
thing that's good too is to measure out

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.569 
thing that's good too is to measure out
how<00:00:39.809> much<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.260> remaining<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> reel

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
how much you have remaining on the reel

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.250 
how much you have remaining on the reel
so<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> you'll<00:00:42.149> know<00:00:42.210> exactly<00:00:42.809> how<00:00:43.050> much

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so that you'll know exactly how much

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.680 
so that you'll know exactly how much
line<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:44.460> seventy-five<00:00:45.149> feet<00:00:45.450> or

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
line there is there seventy-five feet or

line there is there seventy-five feet or
a<00:00:45.719> hundred<00:00:46.110> feet<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.710> you're<00:00:46.829> using<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.340> as

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
a hundred feet so if you're using it as

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
a hundred feet so if you're using it as
a<00:00:47.489> measurement<00:00:48.000> tool<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.559> much

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
a measurement tool you know how much

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
a measurement tool you know how much
line<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.750> i<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.020> to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.149 
spool to a surface marker way or to an
anchor<00:01:41.130> line<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.930> end<00:01:42.960> i<00:01:43.320> put<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
anchor line so here at the end i put a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.480 
anchor line so here at the end i put a
nice<00:01:44.460> big<00:01:44.850> loop<00:01:45.170> into<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> line<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> tied<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
nice big loop into the line so I tied a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.050 
nice big loop into the line so I tied a
knot<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> nice<00:01:49.500> big<00:01:49.770> loop<00:01:50.060> that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
knot here so I have a nice big loop that

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.660 
knot here so I have a nice big loop that
way<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.630> attach<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.680> my<00:01:52.710> surface<00:01:53.070> marker

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
way I can attach it to my surface marker

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.569 
way I can attach it to my surface marker
boy<00:01:53.850> easily<00:01:54.420> by<00:01:54.600> passing<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> through<00:01:55.579> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
boy easily by passing it through that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
boy easily by passing it through that
loop<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.850> then<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.149> you're<00:02:00.750> diving

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
loop like so and then if you're diving

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.590 
loop like so and then if you're diving
especially<00:02:02.100> where<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.670> cold<00:02:03.149> water<00:02:03.420> where

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
especially where in cold water where

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910 
especially where in cold water where
you're<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> wear<00:02:04.049> thick<00:02:04.320> gloves<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you're going to wear thick gloves you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380 
you're going to wear thick gloves you
want<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> put<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> little<00:02:05.640> loop<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> end

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
want to put a little loop in the end

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.089 
want to put a little loop in the end
here<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> need<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.710> take<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
here so that when you need to take it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.710 
here so that when you need to take it
apart<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> pull<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
apart you just have to pull on that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.340 
apart you just have to pull on that
little

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
little

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.470 
little
it's<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> make<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.160> lot<00:02:11.340> easier<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it's going to make it a lot easier so

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's going to make it a lot easier so
put<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:12.870> loop<00:02:13.440> at<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.710> end<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:14.790> big

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
put a little loop at the end of your big

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.330 
put a little loop at the end of your big
loop<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> make<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> easy<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> take

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
loop so to make it easy for you to take

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.930 
loop so to make it easy for you to take
it<00:02:17.490> apart<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.800> that's<00:02:19.920> how<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.760> my

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it apart so that's how I like to have my

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.750 
it apart so that's how I like to have my
finger<00:02:21.300> spool<00:02:21.570> set<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.950> when<00:02:23.580> you're

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
finger spool set up and then when you're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.680 
finger spool set up and then when you're
attaching<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.690> yourself<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.860> go<00:02:26.040> diving

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
attaching it to yourself to go diving

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.440 
attaching it to yourself to go diving
the<00:02:27.690> common<00:02:28.290> thing<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.560> do<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.670> clip

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the common thing to do is to just clip

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.930 
the common thing to do is to just clip
off<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:31.020> loop<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.130> clip<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
off this loop and then clip it on to the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.540 
off this loop and then clip it on to the
side<00:02:33.120> here<00:02:33.660> what<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> problem<00:02:35.100> with

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
side here what can be the problem with

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.970 
side here what can be the problem with
that<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.720> very<00:02:36.780> easy<00:02:36.990> for<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that is that it's very easy for it to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.090 
that is that it's very easy for it to
get<00:02:38.190> pushed<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.030> come<00:02:39.750> unlatched<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
get pushed and come unlatched on you and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.140 
get pushed and come unlatched on you and
then<00:02:41.190> your<00:02:41.340> reel<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.610> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> come<00:02:41.970> all

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
then your reel is going to come all

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
then your reel is going to come all
apart<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> underwater<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.580> found

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
apart on you underwater so what I found

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.280 
apart on you underwater so what I found
works<00:02:45.450> well<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.600> actually<00:02:48.600> pass<00:02:48.870> your

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
works well is if you actually pass your

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.550 
works well is if you actually pass your
loop<00:02:49.530> through<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.610> one<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.300> these<00:02:51.480> holes<00:02:55.760> and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
loop through on one of these holes and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.350 
loop through on one of these holes and
then<00:02:58.560> you're<00:02:58.740> going<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.010> clip<00:02:59.340> off<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:00.060> clip

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
then you're going to clip off the clip

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.190 
then you're going to clip off the clip
to<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.780> line<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.740> AOF<00:03:02.070> hanging<00:03:02.520> out<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
to that line the AOF hanging out and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.830 
to that line the AOF hanging out and
this<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.380> going<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.680> hold<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.250> away<00:03:05.610> from<00:03:06.600> your

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
this is going to hold it away from your

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
this is going to hold it away from your
equipment<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.100> not<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> get

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
equipment so that it's not going to get

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.150 
equipment so that it's not going to get
pushed<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.450> there<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.840> unlatched<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:10.980> so

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
pushed in there and unlatched on you so

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.770 
pushed in there and unlatched on you so
you<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.400> clip<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.760> off<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.630> your

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
you can clip it off like that to your

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.880 
you can clip it off like that to your
equipment<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:14.690> that's<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.990> for<00:03:16.200> finger<00:03:16.500> tools

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
equipment and that's it for finger tools

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.460 
equipment and that's it for finger tools
a<00:03:17.100> really<00:03:17.340> good<00:03:17.520> item<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.810> put<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.140> part<00:03:19.410> of

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
a really good item to put as part of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.250 
a really good item to put as part of
your<00:03:19.650> kit<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.580> get<00:03:20.790> them<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:21.540> know<00:03:21.630> 65

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
your kit you can get them in you know 65

go really well with your surface marker
boy<00:03:28.560> which<00:03:28.830> I'll<00:03:28.980> talk<00:03:29.190> about<00:03:29.220> later
