were there I don't know I've sex sells

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.280 
were there I don't know I've sex sells
and<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.900> kind<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.170> a

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
and it's it you know this is kind of a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.990 
and it's it you know this is kind of a
little<00:03:40.530> bit<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.799> experiment<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.519> could<00:03:41.730> fail

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
little bit of experiment this could fail

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.330 
little bit of experiment this could fail
you<00:03:42.630> guys<00:03:42.810> could<00:03:43.019> prove<00:03:43.350> me<00:03:43.530> completely<00:03:44.040> wrong

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
you guys could prove me completely wrong

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.660 
you guys could prove me completely wrong
and<00:03:45.320> this<00:03:46.320> could<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.709> know<00:03:46.920> only<00:03:47.190> get<00:03:47.459> two

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
and this could you know only get two

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.009 
and this could you know only get two
thousand<00:03:48.060> views<00:03:48.239> or<00:03:48.360> something<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.840> could<00:03:48.900> be

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
thousand views or something it could be

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.289 
thousand views or something it could be
crazy<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.820> little<00:03:50.940> bit<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.209> an

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
crazy but it's a little bit of an

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.789 
crazy but it's a little bit of an
experiment<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.170> reason<00:03:52.410> for<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.560> is

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
experiment and the reason for that is

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.870 
experiment and the reason for that is
I'm<00:03:53.340> really<00:03:53.579> curious<00:03:53.910> if<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:55.709> thumbnail<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I'm really curious if a thumbnail and a
