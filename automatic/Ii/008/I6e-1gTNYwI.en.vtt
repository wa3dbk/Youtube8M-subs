00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.730 
reason is just to show you that I've
hacked<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.369> her<00:00:21.740> looking

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
hacked it's actually got her looking

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.240 
hacked it's actually got her looking
here<00:00:23.869> microSD<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:26.720> memory<00:00:27.720> stick<00:00:27.990> Pro<00:00:28.289> geo<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
here microSD to memory stick Pro geo and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.700 
here microSD to memory stick Pro geo and
card<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.869> we'll<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> look

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
card in there so we'll just have a look

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.200 
card in there so we'll just have a look
at<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:33.410> what<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> results<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.520> hacking

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
at and what the results of the hacking

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.840 
at and what the results of the hacking
are<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.690> far<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:37.680> easy<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
are so far is really easy to do and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
are so far is really easy to do and
literally<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.390> copy<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.079> couple<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> files

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
literally just copy a couple of files

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.779

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
menu gone to the memory stick so here

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.530 
menu gone to the memory stick so here
you'll<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.100> there's<00:01:20.580> Gameboy<00:01:21.030> emulator

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
you'll see and there's Gameboy emulator

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.460 
you'll see and there's Gameboy emulator
and<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.890> try<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> open<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.259> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and if you try and open that now and it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.789 
and if you try and open that now and it
won't<00:01:25.680> work<00:01:26.360> next<00:01:27.360> down<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.380> basically

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
won't work next down this is basically

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.539 
won't work next down this is basically
installer<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.030> you'll<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:32.310> stop

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
installer so what you'll do is just stop

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.469 
installer so what you'll do is just stop
your<00:01:32.820> PSP

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
your PSP

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.580 
your PSP
run<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> Installer<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:36.600> it'll<00:01:37.049> restart

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
run the Installer and then it'll restart

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.910 
run the Installer and then it'll restart
and<00:01:37.950> it'll<00:01:38.130> basically<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.640> hacked<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.710> only

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and it'll basically be hacked the only

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
and it'll basically be hacked the only
thing<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.520> each<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.540> actually<00:01:42.930> switch

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
thing is each time you actually switch

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
thing is each time you actually switch
the<00:01:44.280> PSP<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.680> it'll<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.729> hack

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the PSP off it'll kind of go out of hack

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.590 
the PSP off it'll kind of go out of hack
mode<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.570> mean<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.759> modern

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
mode I mean you can do that the modern

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.410 
mode I mean you can do that the modern
what<00:01:51.869> you'd<00:01:51.960> call<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> soft<00:01:53.420> power

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
what you'd call that like the soft power

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.170 
what you'd call that like the soft power
off<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.079> ever<00:01:55.380> home<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.159> could<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
off or ever home you could do that and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
off or ever home you could do that and
it<00:01:57.329> will<00:01:57.420> remain<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.649> hack<00:01:58.950> state<00:01:59.369> once

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
it will remain in the hack state once

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.469 
it will remain in the hack state once
it's<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:02.340> say<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.060> go<00:02:03.210> for

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it's in there but like say if you go for

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.920 
it's in there but like say if you go for
the<00:02:03.540> full<00:02:04.579> hard<00:02:05.579> power<00:02:06.000> off<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.570> whatever<00:02:06.780> you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the full hard power off or whatever you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.390 
the full hard power off or whatever you
on<00:02:07.049> call<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.560> may<00:02:07.740> hold<00:02:08.069> down<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.950> power

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
on call it may hold down the the power

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.880 
on call it may hold down the the power
slider

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
slider

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.490 
slider
then<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:14.480> will<00:02:15.790> revert<00:02:16.790> back<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.930> standard

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
then it will revert back to the standard

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.199 
then it will revert back to the standard
state<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.190> then<00:02:19.370> what<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.670> need<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.850> do<00:02:20.090> is

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
state so then what you need to do is

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.230 
state so then what you need to do is
basically<00:02:20.390> run<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.200> launcher<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:22.240> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
basically run this launcher here and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.400 
basically run this launcher here and
this<00:02:23.420> will<00:02:23.540> basically<00:02:23.750> restart<00:02:24.590> epsp<00:02:25.400> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
this will basically restart epsp and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.620 
this will basically restart epsp and
stop<00:02:27.410> stop<00:02:28.190> again<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.910> hacked<00:02:29.830> mode<00:02:31.510> as<00:02:32.510> you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
stop stop again in hacked mode as you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.240 
stop stop again in hacked mode as you

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
allows us to do if we go to where we

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.250 
allows us to do if we go to where we
were<00:03:06.080> before<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.920> memory<00:03:07.250> stick<00:03:08.260> it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
were before on the memory stick it

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.250

to<00:03:27.079> test<00:03:27.350> this<00:03:27.590> is<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.850> memory<00:03:29.180> cards<00:03:29.540> only

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
to test this is the memory cards only

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.770 
to test this is the memory cards only
say<00:03:29.959> two<00:03:30.019> megabytes<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.299> was<00:03:32.420> just<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:32.750> I
