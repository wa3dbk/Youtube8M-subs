 Hi Hi Dies Stacking Spring Says Today Dies 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:15.650
 What is the attraction of the number stacking to everyone about the stacking course 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.869
 Daisetsu I was started to sterilization or that there is no reference videos 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.480
 If you can refer to this video for those who can not teach people 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.279
 We were allowed to raise the videos I 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.560
 I thought so when I started my first time so I think that such people will definitely be this video 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.310
 The I gained 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.510
 Then I would like to introduce the basic technique immediately 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:44.570
 First fore side 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:51.140
 Shake the cup to feel this cup from the outside to the front and take the number 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:54.760
 It is the stacking on the fore side when you get it, but I will introduce it first 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.760
 Please take a look, because it is hot 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.750
 Yes This is It is Satchingu the fore side 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.670
 all 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.830
 You shake it from the outside to the front and you take soybeans 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.280
 It is a way to stop and build a representative 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.070
 In the good to the next 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.470
 It is the second place as a basic place, but it was a foremost day 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.580
 Next is back good 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.230
 We are taking the first I am waved from the inside to the outside 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.620
 And on the back side of building the dice 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.620
 I will 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.200
 Yes this is bag stacking 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.770
 Both are yeah 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 Shaking is the same as friful feeling 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.040
 As it is more difficult to say bag 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 I think if you can practice 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.050
 Either technique is probably a week or a week and a half 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.680
ãƒ¼

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.970
 Even though there is that individual differences do you think so and can learn 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.100
 I think you can do it in general, so please try it out for everyone 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:12.069
 Today I will do more than this 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.069
