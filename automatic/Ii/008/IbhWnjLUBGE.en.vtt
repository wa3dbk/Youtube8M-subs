00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.839
 we waited for the second 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.450
 generations of flagship SUV from 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.079
 audi and I must admit the expectations 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.690
 justified 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:21.200
 not only is the car radically 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.950
 changed outwardly and technically so yet 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.630
 the interior is fresh and expressive 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.000
 not without reason the audience thunderous applause 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.190
 I met not spend technical 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.419
 water director 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.900
 new model will exceed all expectations 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.079
 customer trends all minimizes not 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.640
 bypassed howdy designers 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.700
 the car got a sophisticated front 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.649
 panel and wide center console with 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.460
 joysticks mode switching 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.710
 multi-inch transmission color 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.370
 the display is hiding in the same front panel 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.450
 and appears on command pilot 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.940
 enjoying all these qualities and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.290
 luxury about specifications and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.190
 don't think at all 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.700
 but in vain besides those already familiar to us 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.540
 versions with a 3-liter 333 strong 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.330
 petrol power unit and 3 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.049
 liter diesel engine which gives 272 thousand 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.940
 272 horsepower in 2015 coal 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.890
 the road builder appears diesel hybrid 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.850
 version in which are added 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.700
 electric motor 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.070
 and the battery is charged from an external source 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 power supply 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.189
 total capacity of such an installation 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.990
 is up 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.720
 373 horsepower and fuel consumption at 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 this is how engineers will report in 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.590
 one and seven liter for a hundred 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.590
 kilometers
