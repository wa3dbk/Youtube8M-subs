00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello today I have one represented like 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.960
 we have for you i have in february now 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.880
 It can be done because I'm not there yet 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.210
 I had liked so many things 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.130
 to have 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 Now I wanted to do one again 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 We have a few things very often 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.609
 used and is then a few 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 older things either I here and the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.689
 new insect for me and the first one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.369
 product that I want to show you is 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 the holes so this first anti age 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.720
 effect concealer of maybelline jade 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 already have some other youtubers too 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430
 shown here and when I saw him then 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 I think that's relative 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.829
 expensive ten euros for a council already 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.899
 happig, but I always come in winter 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 have some problems with dark circles 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.780
 because just my skin under the eyes 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 she does not seem too thin 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 and there they are just hiding 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.170
 I have to cover a bit extra 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.180
 I did not find that pretty much every now and then 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.239
 well i never really felt that way 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.300
 understood about that I always wanted 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 but very economical with it 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.820
 Actually you do not have to be so economical 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.110
 because he keeps that for quite a long time 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.640
 I also found out now 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.500
 and I always found a bit 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.960
 stupid with the posing with this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.360
 sponge the top but I think there 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.400
 you have to come in a bit first 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.509
 I really like him with that and now 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.630
 like and he has a very good one 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.009
 opacity and that's why I do it 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.200
 Just like this month and then 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.450
 I have a combination for myself 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.189
 I have always discovered this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.420
 table applied this labello 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.040
 classic but that 's not i know 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.390
 not if we know that sometimes 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.310
 the la belle is a bit like that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.470
 greasier and he has him already is one 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.409
 a bit greasier won I have 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.990
 soft at or just because it is not in 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.810
 fridge was always in the warm and warm 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.840
 then I liked to apply it then 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.040
 another lipstick from patrice or 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.780
 at times just so pinkl coral or red 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.630
 sounds 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.670
 and then they were not so strong 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.080
 but have been distributed nicely and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.550
 They are not in the mouth either 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.440
 Creeps and I find it 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.540
 just really nice of course 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.080
 somehow had something on the lips 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.800
 and I just really liked it 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.420
 this combination and I have 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 actually almost every day so happy 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.230
 carry 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.420
 and then I have an eyeshadow 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.340
 I really liked the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.340
 not always very happy to marry in 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.290
 the eyes because I felt that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.980
 then the eyes extra blasted again 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.470
 have our hard fact out of the blanket 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.590
 palette of gold to do as I believe 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.390
 a drugstore of patrice or it is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.090
 I wish there were many, too 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.250
 golden tones and you do not necessarily have to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.860
 but I had him just now 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.780
 home and took them then bring 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.459
 and I really liked that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.380
 because it just looked really nice and 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.970
 yes, I also like this one very much 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.160
 especially for the month 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.049
 go away and now I have mine 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.090
 favorite outfit for you that yourself 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.459
 very happy to have worn this month 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.790
 and then I wish you much fun while 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.790
 look at 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:38.249
 funny money back room street slide and 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.799
 I had two this month 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:43.859
 favorite corners for the lions too 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.620
 one because the fourth season is this 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.129
 Months ended and I found them 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.930
 just so exciting and great and so on 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.030
 unexpectedly all are too i can do it 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.709
 hardly wait until the fifth comes out 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.719
 but I 'm a bit sad too 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.239
 that the series then goes to end 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.579
 yes, but there is still a little time left 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.949
 and then I have another series for 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.629
 discovered me and that end because I 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.400
 pictures as if I had looked 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.829
 Of course I needed a new series 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.769
 I think they discovered it for me and there 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.810
 is it just a woman who helps 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.459
 to solve any crimes 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.259
 maybe such over himself 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.759
 Descriptions to the show but me 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:25.440
 I'm a bit worse shipments 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:27.210
 to describe but I think this is very 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.789
 exciting and I really really like me 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.889
 I am now at the second season 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.139
 I started now and I like those 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.449
 really like series 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.210
 and then I had this month too 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.030
 Two electronic devices that I like very much 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.550
 like to do and for one it is this 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.490
 device of trips and is over 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.930
 bluetooth the tram ass hens 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.330
 update and then it's serious 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.259
 speakers and I do that very much 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.360
 like unity 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.770
 my mom but if she is magath 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.159
 did not take me I 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.750
 loaned 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.330
 Yes, I like to do that when I am 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.650
 I could clear my room 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.449
 just then by the way nice music and then 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.389
 I still have an electronic device 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.889
 it wants to show and it sounds 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:21.229
 maybe a little stupid but it is 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:26.280
 a lamp is missing here is the place 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:28.259
 and never is from ikea and i have those 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.270
 There are also often times on any 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.990
 to see pictures and 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.840
 not like 40 euros I'm cost 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.340
 I just was not sure but she found 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.470
 I'm just very beautiful and me now 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.760
 always stand by my desk and there 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.540
 I'm never happy with a desk lamp 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.190
 and I 'm just so practical and 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.930
 so yes about which I am also very 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.870
 It is very much looking forward to having brought 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.060
 why could also 1 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.950
 and then I have a few more 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.260
 favorite songs from february and march the 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.870
 I really liked to hear and once 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.970
 is it james blunt heart to heart and 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.950
 i love this song i am doing it 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.860
 just such a happy mood and 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.890
 I do not like it that much 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.200
 then I also like what the plates 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.330

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.920

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.310

 and then I also from jesse james 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.720
 sexy lady likes to hear and the two 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.380
 I really like that because 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.720
 they are a little bit faster and faster 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.100
 a little something for the evening but me 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.660

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.410
 I really like it and I want it too 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.680

 and then I still have avril lavigne 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.180
 I really like rock'n'roll 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.610
 that sometimes a war like that 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.980
 the mainz tastes right and varies 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.070
 I also liked that song a lot 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:09.200
 at all jessica and avril lavigne 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:11.150
 I liked the month very much like the albums 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.250
 that you brought out last 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.000

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.680

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.530

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.600
