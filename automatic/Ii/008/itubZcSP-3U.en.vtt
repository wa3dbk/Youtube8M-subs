 Formerly this is the sign, Jackson said firmly as you can see it 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.200
 sings and dances and stands for the ground » 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.539
 For years already thinks and last film some find him an emergency 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.119
 Others, on the other hand, we saw ourselves in a very good mood 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.080
 Propofol used by 1 none for the publication is of course already 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.789
 cleverly 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.069
 Jacko and Halloween that fits somehow 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.620
 I said the bad word 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.500
 so went 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 yes, many of our viewers are downright see 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.180
 the Kloten Flyers big cost if they want that No yes I know about it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 Commercial shit and then not even a holiday 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.190
 Of course I do not come with the young man of his 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.180
 no monsters but these 800 crafting ideas for Hello really 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.190
 listed are a home improvement paradise the new challenges 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.850
 search and with many projects 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.670
 then you can not only on Saturday neighbor's children but the whole 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.229
 Year burglars chase an absolute eye-catcher, however, is the disguise in 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.200
 This young lady is just sleeping 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.350
 she goes as a cartoon character 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.500
 amazement 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.299
 by the way 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.219
 it does not always have to do with Halloween if suddenly 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.159
 run around half dead everywhere 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.640
 No, not with health care reform so that you are in place 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.700
 the film industry in the media he 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.370
 where you obviously can not spam mails but also give so credible 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.590
 Writing scripts can be seen in this photo series by Pieter Hugo 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 There are also some interesting comments on the way the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.070
 Perhaps the biggest movie industry in the world will be read 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.780
 For example, the Holtbys Lohmöller would be worthy of absolute poverty 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.830
 With «The x- movies meanwhile bet the short trailer to the film we already had 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.600
 once presented but now there is the ten minute shocker over the spoon 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.170
 More there finally officially and in HD quality to see 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.560
 Unfortunately, it is not always just a movie or Halonen if dead too 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.490
 are complaining 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.700
 and then there is no reason to laugh 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.780
 as well as on this attacking photo where he watches some chimpanzees 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.790
 like her late girlfriend Dorit who is being buried to death 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.760
 Full story to the picture can be read here at National Geographic 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.120
 Merckle was therefore the one who had been motivated to survive a meteorite impact 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.879
 The only problem since that time is that he always lives and lives exactly 91 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.180
 Centimeters next to him tells his humorous and thoughtful story 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.079
 the multiple award-winning animated film Starline by Jerini 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.769
 foldable 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.769
 after a woman as so often in the fresh air 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:39.609
 by the way 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.289
 Unfortunately, the film was masked earlier in the Video Game Awards, but I think so 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.309
 I know who is behind the mask 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.780
 Martina Schlatter 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.160
 In any case he would have the right arm for that and with that he says im 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.320
 Internet for a few days for a lot of attention who his muscles but something 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.700
 unevenly distributed on the body but for that he is one of the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.490
 most successful German professional on the trigger and for him would be natural 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.819
 Such a muscle computer interface ideal with which you can use electronic devices 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.990
 For example, use an mp3 player when muscle tension is applied 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.939
 Jogging the car ferry service although you have both hands full 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.299
 or of course also done Euro and only with the air guitar 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.759
 that may be I am blessed 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:23.799
 I thought
