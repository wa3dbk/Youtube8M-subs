00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
don't and I think they get so scared

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.200 
don't and I think they get so scared
because<00:05:11.770> they<00:05:11.980> don't<00:05:12.310> know<00:05:12.430> what's<00:05:12.700> going<00:05:13.030> on

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
because they don't know what's going on

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.680 
because they don't know what's going on
and<00:05:13.860> they<00:05:14.860> just<00:05:15.130> they<00:05:15.670> do<00:05:15.880> dumb<00:05:16.300> things<00:05:16.330> like

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.940 
just like they're out doing our whole
pregnancy<00:07:10.200> but

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.350 

but<00:07:14.950> I<00:07:15.660> think<00:07:16.660> that<00:07:17.070> us<00:07:18.070> as<00:07:18.400> women<00:07:18.580> get<00:07:19.060> through

but I think that us as women get through

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.060 
but I think that us as women get through
it<00:07:19.540> and<00:07:19.690> then<00:07:19.870> especially<00:07:20.110> with<00:07:20.560> the<00:07:20.680> support

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
it and then especially with the support

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.050 
it and then especially with the support
of<00:07:21.130> each<00:07:21.280> other<00:07:21.520> so<00:07:22.800> anyway<00:07:23.800> if<00:07:24.670> you're<00:07:24.850> in<00:07:24.970> a

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
of each other so anyway if you're in a

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.500 
of each other so anyway if you're in a
situation<00:07:25.270> like<00:07:25.690> I<00:07:26.080> am<00:07:26.350> then<00:07:26.860> I<00:07:27.580> would<00:07:28.030> love<00:07:28.240> to

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
situation like I am then I would love to
