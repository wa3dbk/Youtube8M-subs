00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
never want to hold just the smiles that

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.090 
never want to hold just the smiles that
are<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.570> their<00:04:10.720> faces<00:04:10.920> motivates<00:04:11.920> me<00:04:12.070> every

are on their faces motivates me every

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.720 
are on their faces motivates me every
time<00:04:13.530> for<00:04:14.530> me<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:14.890> trip<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.430> biggest

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
time for me on this trip the biggest

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.420 
time for me on this trip the biggest
challenge<00:04:16.209> probably<00:04:16.690> was<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.709> inability<00:04:18.070> to

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
challenge probably was the inability to

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.520 
challenge probably was the inability to
communicate<00:04:18.970> since<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:19.900> don't<00:04:20.049> actually<00:04:20.260> know

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
communicate since I don't actually know

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.980 
communicate since I don't actually know
any<00:04:20.709> Portuguese<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.489> really<00:04:22.270> enjoy<00:04:22.570> playing

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
any Portuguese I really enjoy playing

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.890 
any Portuguese I really enjoy playing
stuck<00:04:23.680> with<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.980> kids<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:25.690> way<00:04:25.870> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
stuck with the kids and that way I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.040 
stuck with the kids and that way I
didn't<00:04:26.320> really<00:04:26.440> have<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:27.480> know<00:04:28.480> Portuguese

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
didn't really have to know Portuguese

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.320 
didn't really have to know Portuguese
and<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:29.560> speak<00:04:29.830> with<00:04:30.010> them<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.460> kick

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
and just speak with them and just kick

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.730 
and just speak with them and just kick
the<00:04:31.450> ball<00:04:31.660> around<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:32.260> communicate

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
the ball around and then communicate

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.410 
the ball around and then communicate
with<00:04:32.860> them

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
with them

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.390 
with them
definitely<00:04:35.260> seemed<00:04:35.440> like<00:04:35.590> everyone<00:04:36.070> who<00:04:36.310> is

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
definitely seemed like everyone who is

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.450 
definitely seemed like everyone who is
there<00:04:36.640> really<00:04:37.740> wanted<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.920> be<00:04:39.040> there<00:04:39.070> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
there really wanted to be there and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.490 
there really wanted to be there and
really<00:04:39.730> wanted<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.090> be<00:04:40.210> seen<00:04:40.480> because<00:04:41.170> there

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
really wanted to be seen because there

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800 
really wanted to be seen because there
are<00:04:41.620> people<00:04:41.650> from<00:04:42.370> other<00:04:42.820> villages<00:04:43.120> who<00:04:43.660> would

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
are people from other villages who would

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.990 
are people from other villages who would
take<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> boat<00:04:44.290> down<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.890> where<00:04:45.550> we<00:04:45.670> were<00:04:45.790> set<00:04:45.970> up

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
take a boat down to where we were set up

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.720 
take a boat down to where we were set up
just<00:04:46.420> so<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:46.750> they<00:04:47.020> could<00:04:47.230> be<00:04:47.350> seen<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.980> think

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
just so that they could be seen I think

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.420 
just so that they could be seen I think
they<00:04:48.850> definitely<00:04:49.950> appreciated<00:04:50.950> that<00:04:51.220> we<00:04:51.370> were

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:12.529 
got it right sometimes it's not it was

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.820

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.660 

you

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
you

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.560 
you
one<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.110> highlights<00:05:21.470> of<00:05:21.650> my<00:05:21.710> trip<00:05:21.920> is<00:05:22.570> the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
one of the highlights of my trip is the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.690 
one of the highlights of my trip is the
opportunity<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:24.050> we<00:05:24.200> were<00:05:24.290> able<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.700> play

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
opportunity that we were able to play

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.820 
opportunity that we were able to play
with<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.030> kids<00:05:26.300> even<00:05:27.290> though<00:05:27.500> there<00:05:27.680> was<00:05:27.800> a

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
with the kids even though there was a

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.670 
with the kids even though there was a
language<00:05:28.370> barrier<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:28.880> think<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.540> play<00:05:30.290> is<00:05:30.440> very

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
language barrier I think a play is very

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.160 
language barrier I think a play is very
universal<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.420> think<00:05:32.480> that<00:05:32.690> was<00:05:32.930> an<00:05:33.050> awesome

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
universal so I think that was an awesome

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:41.110 
universal so I think that was an awesome
experience<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:38.320> huge<00:05:39.320> thing<00:05:40.280> for<00:05:40.340> me<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.700> just

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
experience a huge thing for me is just

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.180 
experience a huge thing for me is just
seeing<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.510> smiles<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:42.200> the<00:05:42.530> children<00:05:42.770> have

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
seeing the smiles that the children have

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.310 
seeing the smiles that the children have
and<00:05:43.520> that<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.300> parents<00:05:44.810> have<00:05:44.930> when<00:05:45.200> they're

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
and that the parents have when they're

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.520 
and that the parents have when they're
watching<00:05:45.800> their<00:05:45.950> children<00:05:46.600> interact<00:05:47.600> with<00:05:47.750> us
