00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hello everyone is safe to their Breedlove to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.870
 the enemy in front of us battle on the map of the airfield 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.870
 between fork clans and spud clan 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.650
 Aerodrome war is not a city. 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.100
 that is, the setup of both teams of both of us 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.610
 see and so quickly go through 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.460
 Footsteps forka is 6 hectares 3 baht veshka 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.470
 than the flash drive took interesting and stepashka 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.360
 140 62 two circuits, but psp udavchik 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:42.340
 maneuver her the same amount of pawns 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.239
 the same proportions plus or minus but 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.510
 them to the bottom here cords to more and s tragic and 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.890
 mostly weave from family that is 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.059
 about fifty fifty time 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.920
 like whipping 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:01.420
 valid exclusively fathers and up to usb 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:09.580
 boa is a rota tomato that is already 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:12.120
 promises an interesting fight 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.120
 forks 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.370
 catch baht by making a mistake it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.700
 still caught 6 percent left but 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.960
 it is of course all the same 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.869
 and the competition picks up the tomato after all 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.369
 keep 3000 mid -level battat 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:40.679
 in the mouths it does not work 10 in favor of forks 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.649
 and the battish bastard already their leaves on 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.770
 the base is likely to go alive of course 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.670
 well done artillery of the other very very 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.049
 nice bat shines which we see 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.049
 it means that the woman is glowing 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.869
 parks are more or less standard 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.280
 sometimes building too grab to 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.770
 react quickly as from this side 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
 so with this 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.500
 a couple of cars shine hysterical rolls on 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.090
 runway also highlighted well and day 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.680
 in tsiva 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.290
 not all, and here the goals from here 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.530
 Prokidyvat but in principle in cheese 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.660
 it remains to 8 minutes and disassemble this here 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.100
 Of these days, exclude narta course for 7 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.050
 minutes already left will not work batik 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.050
 here is this course all the same ideally leave 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 goes the color between the two bolts friend 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.099
 friend game from artillery park from first 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.209
 spawn 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.230
 respectively, they still appear to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.599
 satisfied to capture the base 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.810
 Well, most likely it is fortified areas and 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.180
 so forok draw suits me so 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.080
 guess up the action well that means it 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.280
 fortified to four still staged 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.290
 bat shines women with pounds gone principle 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.840
 Now you can try out stitches 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.230
 run away 7 minutes and nothing 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:25.440
 not happening 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:26.800
 increase the speed is still something 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.350
 this 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:41.920
 forte waiting in a hurry something necessary 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:46.690
 do the artillery threw will sign that by 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.680
 he was shot out and yes they decide something 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.050
 do all the same forks their st-shki food on 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.300
 water will now be collected and will rashit 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.460
 water while on the other hand 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.800
 decide to weave and understand 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.340
 take pawns out of pawns 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.580
 On capture and I her and they stumble on 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.240
 a huge number of tragic the peremeshku 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.090
 with rhymes usb boa kudy cooked 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.880
 surprise with a similar game but a little 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.950
 later komi according to another 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.950
 they have much less power 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.430
 let's see what basically of this 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.810
 it will turn out and the st-shki confused reacted 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.810
 Now I will reduce the speed 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.490
 so the score is 53 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.090
 while seven water 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.840
 coping a bunch and a stack of poods trying 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:50.580
 replay 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:52.690
 one hundred forks account is more or less equal 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:05.170
 advantage gradually gradually 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:07.810
 all leaves for com account 11 7 certainly not 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.910
 turned sevens 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.800
 weave in the minority when even 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:19.180
 backed by st chic something to do with rush 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.260
 weave forks and small enough 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.270
 number of skirmishes 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.340
 I am not mistaken 3 was able to hold back 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.450
 four opponents long enough 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:35.700
 time so on the other hand rush weave 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.700
 could deal with his opponents 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:51.090
 12 9 is now likely to be 1210 on 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.820
 what's really interesting is that 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.610
 for circulation or us pood services here 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.500
 there was a majority here somehow here let 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.450
 they are basically stacks in fact 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:07.090
 on the seizure so that it would be weave 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.160
 just did not have time to return it 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.620
 return one two st-shki but would be 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.440
 here losses let 3 cars here 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.000
 against there two or three of the points but 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.010
 cut out the art and tried to take the base 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.030
 it is, in principle, there could be, and could 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:27.220
 would not be 12:09 weave should 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.340
 take place on pick up leftover 3 minutes before 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.340
 end of battle 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.990
 most likely a draw suits forks 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.860
 the beginning is not all the same a little more active 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.860
 now played 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:49.350
 unfortunately there is whether we see but 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:54.300
 see the other side can now 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.780
 will succeed the baht takes the baht gets up 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.910
 capture 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.230
 but in any case they have time to dive 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:05.790
 basically subscribe really 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.570
 forki played very nicely in a timely manner 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:12.330
 very pressured weave turned out rush 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.620
 the very beginning of the battle of course killed vata too 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.660
 very very good 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:21.690
 artillery in general in this battle played 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:25.820
 great 14:09 basically stayed 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.820
 finish the last seven 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:38.840
 and 15 9 clan victory org
