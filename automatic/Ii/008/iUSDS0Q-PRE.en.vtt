team<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.510> BYU<00:00:22.080> line<00:00:22.890> sitting<00:00:23.279> at

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
team in this one BYU line sitting at

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
team in this one BYU line sitting at
seven<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> half<00:00:23.970> probably<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.170> up

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
seven and a half probably going to go up

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960 
seven and a half probably going to go up
before<00:00:25.680> kickoff<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.609> that's<00:00:26.760> where<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
before kickoff I think that's where the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.660 
before kickoff I think that's where the
value<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.630> made<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.960> true<00:00:28.320> line<00:00:28.529> boise<00:00:29.400> state

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
value is I made my true line boise state

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.849 
value is I made my true line boise state
minus<00:00:30.060> four<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.050> not<00:00:31.080> surprised<00:00:31.650> it's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
minus four but I'm not surprised it's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.620 
minus four but I'm not surprised it's
this<00:00:32.040> high<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.180> bettors

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
this high not just because the bettors

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.240 
this high not just because the bettors
meaning<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> betting<00:00:34.500> public<00:00:34.680> are<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
meaning the betting public are going to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
meaning the betting public are going to
take<00:00:35.399> Boise<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:36.989> their<00:00:37.260> home<00:00:37.469> field

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
take Boise but because their home field

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
take Boise but because their home field
advantage<00:00:38.340> everyone<00:00:38.879> believes<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.750> high

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
advantage everyone believes it's so high

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
advantage everyone believes it's so high
but<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> look<00:00:40.950> over<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> last<00:00:41.460> few

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but if you look over the last few

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.420 
but if you look over the last few
seasons<00:00:42.030> its<00:00:42.960> factored<00:00:43.469> into<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> number<00:00:44.190> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
seasons its factored into the number and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
seasons its factored into the number and
you<00:00:44.579> say<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> find

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you say it all the time you got to find

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
you say it all the time you got to find
something<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.340> factored<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
something that's not factored into the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
something that's not factored into the
number<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> find<00:00:48.899> value<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> comes

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
number to find value and when it comes

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
number to find value and when it comes
to<00:00:50.370> Boise<00:00:50.670> State's<00:00:50.910> home<00:00:51.120> field<00:00:51.420> that's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to Boise State's home field that's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.479 
to Boise State's home field that's
definitely<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> price<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
definitely in the price all right so I

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
definitely in the price all right so I
would<00:00:53.699> agree<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> look<00:00:55.230> at

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
would agree with you that if you look at

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
would agree with you that if you look at
Boise's<00:00:55.890> 80s<00:00:56.309> record<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.879> home<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.989> good

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
Boise's 80s record at home not as good

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.790 
Boise's 80s record at home not as good
recently<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.640> prior<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.199> could<00:01:01.649> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
recently as prior which is could be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.460 
recently as prior which is could be
random<00:01:02.449> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.719> having<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.170> random

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
random you know just having some random

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.109 
random you know just having some random
bad<00:01:04.619> game<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.100> could<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> numbers<00:01:05.970> are

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
bad game so it could be the numbers are

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.510 
bad game so it could be the numbers are
being<00:01:06.540> adjusted<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.770> said<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.189> true

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
being adjusted but you said your true

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000 
being adjusted but you said your true
number<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.570> let's<00:01:09.720> define<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
number so let's define that is what you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
number so let's define that is what you
think<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.520> split<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> result<00:01:12.630> 55th

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
think would split the result 55th

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530 
think would split the result 55th
correct<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> game<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.610> played<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> million

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
correct if the game was played a million

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.399 
correct if the game was played a million
times<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.159> now<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:18.060> Vegas<00:01:18.780> rankings

aren't would it couldn't the case we

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.530 
aren't would it couldn't the case we
made<00:02:37.320> their<00:02:37.470> perpetually<00:02:38.070> underrated<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:38.820> and

made their perpetually underrated or and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.530 
made their perpetually underrated or and
that<00:02:40.440> they<00:02:40.590> actually<00:02:41.070> are<00:02:41.460> very<00:02:41.820> mindful<00:02:42.210> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that they actually are very mindful of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.940 
that they actually are very mindful of
covering<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.200> number<00:02:43.530> which<00:02:43.680> when<00:02:43.830> you're

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
covering the number which when you're

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.500 
covering the number which when you're
laying<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.310> big<00:02:44.490> numbers<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:44.970> they<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.330> as

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
laying the big numbers like they are as

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.980 
laying the big numbers like they are as
a<00:02:45.540> part<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.080> well<00:02:46.730> both<00:02:47.730> parts<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.360> think<00:02:48.840> for

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
a part of it well both parts I think for

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.080 
a part of it well both parts I think for
a<00:02:49.020> while<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.410> were<00:02:49.470> undervalued<00:02:50.090> because

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
a while they were undervalued because

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.630 
a while they were undervalued because
they<00:02:51.240> were<00:02:51.300> at<00:02:51.800> second<00:02:52.800> tier<00:02:52.980> team<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.430> mean

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
they were at second tier team I mean

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.010 
they were at second tier team I mean
let's<00:02:53.760> tell<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.210> is<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.600> non-bcs

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
let's tell it like it is the non-bcs

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.350 
let's tell it like it is the non-bcs
school<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:55.980> always<00:02:56.250> tried<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.550> crash<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
school that always tried to crash the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.670 
school that always tried to crash the
party<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:58.380> because<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.520> knew<00:02:59.760> they<00:02:59.970> had<00:03:00.240> to

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
party but because they knew they had to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.340 
party but because they knew they had to
over<00:03:01.680> perform<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.210> up<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> radiance

our rankings they used to go for style
points<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:07.710> you<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.550> have<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.970> team<00:03:09.240> to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.140 
points but you have to have the team to
be<00:03:09.630> able<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.960> do<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.830> season<00:03:11.430> Boise

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
be able to do it and this season Boise

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.940 
be able to do it and this season Boise
just<00:03:12.330> doesn't<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:13.770> what's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
just doesn't have that all right what's

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.800 
just doesn't have that all right what's

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
the most important handicapping factor

the most important handicapping factor
we<00:03:15.900> haven't<00:03:16.230> discussed<00:03:16.410> about<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:17.040> game<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
we haven't discussed about this game I

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.300 
we haven't discussed about this game I
think<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> matchup<00:03:18.390> favors<00:03:18.870> BYU<00:03:19.350> meaning<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
think the matchup favors BYU meaning the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.760 
think the matchup favors BYU meaning the
way<00:03:20.459> these<00:03:20.640> two<00:03:20.880> teams<00:03:20.910> match<00:03:21.390> up<00:03:21.690> BYU's<00:03:22.500> just

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
way these two teams match up BYU's just

last season and they're going up against
a<00:03:36.360> Boise<00:03:36.930> team<00:03:37.230> who's<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.310> weak<00:03:38.520> link<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:38.970> that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
a Boise team who's the weak link is that

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.940 
a Boise team who's the weak link is that
front<00:03:39.390> seven<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.140> they'll<00:03:40.290> be<00:03:40.410> able<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.709> run

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
front seven so they'll be able to run

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.949 
front seven so they'll be able to run
and<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.880> will<00:03:41.970> be<00:03:42.060> able<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.269> set<00:03:42.510> up<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.720> pass

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
and that will be able to set up the pass
