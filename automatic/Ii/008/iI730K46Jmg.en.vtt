today I want to discuss a quite tricky

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.429 
today I want to discuss a quite tricky
question<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:17.039> why<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.820> personally<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:19.260> not

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
question it is why I personally have not

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.910 
question it is why I personally have not
lost<00:00:19.740> any<00:00:20.160> weight<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.390> road<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:22.140> diets

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
lost any weight on the road for diets

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
lost any weight on the road for diets
for<00:00:23.760> those<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> who<00:00:24.420> don't<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.289> was

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
for those of you who don't know I was

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.509 
for those of you who don't know I was
raw<00:00:25.680> tool<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.240> six<00:00:27.990> months<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.830> my

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
raw tool for for about six months of my

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.290 
raw tool for for about six months of my
15<00:00:30.449> months<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.779> total<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.529> high<00:00:32.009> carb<00:00:32.489> eating

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
15 months in total of high carb eating

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
15 months in total of high carb eating
so<00:00:34.020> six<00:00:34.380> months<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> didn't<00:00:35.130> lose<00:00:35.309> any<00:00:35.610> weight

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
so six months I didn't lose any weight

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
so six months I didn't lose any weight
and<00:00:36.559> here<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.770> four<00:00:38.550> factors<00:00:38.820> why<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.590> was

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and here are four factors why this was

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.520 
and here are four factors why this was
so<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.390> two<00:00:42.660> factors<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
so there are two factors that I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 
so there are two factors that I
basically<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:45.390> able<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
basically was not really able to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
basically was not really able to
influence<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.219> factors<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
influence and there are two factors I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
influence and there are two factors I
could<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> influenced<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.739> two<00:00:50.010> factors

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
could have influenced the two factors

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.540 
could have influenced the two factors
and<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.820> could<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.300> been<00:00:51.539> able<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.050> influence

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and I could have been able to influence

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.439 
and I could have been able to influence
was<00:00:53.550> number<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.770> ate<00:00:56.280> out<00:00:56.640> quite<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
was number one that I ate out quite a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
was number one that I ate out quite a
lot<00:00:57.719> because<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.649> had<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.190> visitor

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
lot because you know I had a visitor

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
lot because you know I had a visitor
from<00:00:59.879> Germany<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.500> were<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
from Germany and I think we were out in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
from Germany and I think we were out in
town<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> lot<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.850> recite<00:01:03.210> sayings<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.840> France

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
town a lot we recite sayings in France

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
town a lot we recite sayings in France
and<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.769> walking<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and just walking around so we kind of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.020 
and just walking around so we kind of
had<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> eat<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.799> quite<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> few<00:01:08.460> times<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
had to eat out quite a few times and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.130 
had to eat out quite a few times and
maybe<00:01:09.590> this<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:11.040> too<00:01:11.640> fatty<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.689> course<00:01:13.020> we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
maybe this was too fatty of course we

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
maybe this was too fatty of course we
always<00:01:13.320> asked<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.799> high<00:01:14.040> carb<00:01:14.310> low<00:01:14.400> fat<00:01:14.520> food

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
always asked for high carb low fat food

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.850 
always asked for high carb low fat food
but<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.900> when<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> comes<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.619> weight<00:01:16.830> loss

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
but I think when it comes to weight loss

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.880 
but I think when it comes to weight loss
new<00:01:17.729> ratio<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.470> 80/10/10<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
new ratio of 80/10/10 which is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.820 
new ratio of 80/10/10 which is
recommended<00:01:20.220> by<00:01:20.549> gray<00:01:20.939> hair<00:01:21.180> does<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.350> work

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
recommended by gray hair does not work

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.399 
recommended by gray hair does not work
for<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.600> mean<00:01:24.840> freely<00:01:25.290> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
for all people I mean freely and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.490 
for all people I mean freely and
generator<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.250> recommend<00:01:26.880> ratio<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.570> 95<00:01:28.170> 5

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
generator they recommend ratio of 95 5

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
generator they recommend ratio of 95 5
so<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.299> should<00:01:30.479> stick

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so I think this is what you should stick

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
so I think this is what you should stick
to<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:31.979> want<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> lose<00:01:32.759> weight<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to if you really want to lose weight and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
to if you really want to lose weight and
since<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.049> discussing<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> question<00:01:35.159> why<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
since I'm discussing the question why I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
since I'm discussing the question why I
didn't<00:01:35.790> lose<00:01:35.939> any<00:01:36.180> weight<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.659> eating

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
didn't lose any weight I think eating

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.640 
didn't lose any weight I think eating
out<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.060> ratio<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> probably<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.229> 10<00:01:40.380> 10

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
out with the ratio of probably in 10 10

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.550 
out with the ratio of probably in 10 10
or<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:41.520> fat<00:01:41.909> calories<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:43.140> probably

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
or even more fat calories was probably

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
or even more fat calories was probably
one<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.159> reasons<00:01:44.340> why<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> didn't<00:01:45.360> drop<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
one of the reasons why I didn't drop a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.219 
one of the reasons why I didn't drop a
pound<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.710> number<00:01:47.399> two<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.909> these

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
pound and number two of these

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.530 
pound and number two of these
influenceable<00:01:49.229> factors<00:01:49.829> was<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> was

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
influenceable factors was that I was

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.920 
influenceable factors was that I was
eating<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:52.439> too<00:01:52.470> late<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.670> days<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.299> was

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
eating way too late on some days I was

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
eating way too late on some days I was
coming<00:01:55.439> home<00:01:55.590> quite<00:01:55.920> late<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.520> weekend

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
coming home quite late on the weekend

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
coming home quite late on the weekend
like<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> said<00:01:57.450> sometimes<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.530> were<00:01:58.649> eating<00:01:58.799> out

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
like I said sometimes we were eating out

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
like I said sometimes we were eating out
when<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.610> were<00:01:59.759> out<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.329> long<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
when we were out for so long but

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.510 
when we were out for so long but
sometimes<00:02:01.530> were<00:02:01.680> actually<00:02:02.040> made<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.340> back

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sometimes were actually made it back

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
sometimes were actually made it back
home<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.240> started<00:02:03.570> cooking<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.649> we

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
home then we started cooking and then we

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.150 
home then we started cooking and then we
maybe<00:02:05.040> ate<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.670> 8<00:02:05.969> p.m.<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.780> i<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.590> way

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
maybe ate at 8 p.m. which i think is way

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800 
maybe ate at 8 p.m. which i think is way
too<00:02:08.220> late<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
too late and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.630 
too late and
also<00:02:10.140> didn't<00:02:10.380> feel<00:02:10.619> good<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.130> next<00:02:11.280> day<00:02:11.490> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
also didn't feel good the next day you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.360 
also didn't feel good the next day you
had<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.150> big<00:02:12.450> belly<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.800> still<00:02:14.130> had

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
had this big belly and you still had

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.449 
had this big belly and you still had
this<00:02:14.550> big<00:02:14.819> belly<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.630> next<00:02:15.990> day<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
this big belly on the next day and I

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.550 
this big belly on the next day and I
think<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.240> lot<00:02:18.540> better<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.230> stick

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
think it is a lot better when you stick

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.430 
think it is a lot better when you stick
to<00:02:19.800> eating<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.790> bit<00:02:21.030> earlier<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.930> eating<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
to eating a bit earlier but eating that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.550 
to eating a bit earlier but eating that
late<00:02:22.680> might<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.520> been<00:02:23.730> also<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.150> reason<00:02:24.720> for

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
late might have been also a reason for

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.430 
late might have been also a reason for
me<00:02:26.100> not<00:02:26.610> releasing<00:02:27.239> any<00:02:27.360> weight<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.840> Wachtel

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
me not releasing any weight on Wachtel

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.710 
me not releasing any weight on Wachtel
for<00:02:28.709> now<00:02:29.340> let's<00:02:29.520> come<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.850> two<00:02:30.090> factors<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
for now let's come to the two factors I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.430 
for now let's come to the two factors I
was<00:02:30.989> not<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:31.680> able<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.250> influence<00:02:33.440> number

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
was not really able to influence number

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.720 
was not really able to influence number
one<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.520> would<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:36.350> consistently<00:02:37.350> low<00:02:38.220> fat

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
one is I would not consistently low fat

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.560 
one is I would not consistently low fat
within<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.510> ratio<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:40.200> 95<00:02:40.980> 5<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.670> course<00:02:42.360> I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
within this ratio of 95 5 of course I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.210 
within this ratio of 95 5 of course I
could<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:42.900> been<00:02:43.140> able<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.470> influence<00:02:44.010> this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
could have been able to influence this

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.690 
could have been able to influence this
but<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.940> whole<00:02:45.060> reason<00:02:45.420> was<00:02:46.400> whenever<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.459> was

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
but the whole reason was whenever I was

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.990 
but the whole reason was whenever I was
raw<00:02:47.940> till<00:02:48.150> 4<00:02:48.269> or<00:02:48.720> eating<00:02:49.019> right<00:02:49.260> before<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.519> had

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
raw till 4 or eating right before I had

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.750 
raw till 4 or eating right before I had
cravings<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:52.230> fats<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.800> wasn't<00:02:53.370> eating<00:02:53.459> any

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
cravings for fats I wasn't eating any

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.570 
cravings for fats I wasn't eating any
nuts<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.450> did<00:02:54.840> eat<00:02:55.080> some<00:02:55.110> avocados<00:02:55.920> about<00:02:56.280> 1

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
nuts but I did eat some avocados about 1

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.900 
nuts but I did eat some avocados about 1
to<00:02:56.819> 2<00:02:57.000> avocados<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:58.170> week<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.190> think<00:02:59.459> this

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
to 2 avocados a week and I think this

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.990 
to 2 avocados a week and I think this
really<00:03:00.600> adds<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.590> your<00:03:01.769> fat<00:03:02.160> content<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
really adds up to your fat content and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.720 
really adds up to your fat content and
of<00:03:03.930> course<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.319> solution<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.370> just

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
of course the solution to this is just

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
of course the solution to this is just
not<00:03:06.030> eat<00:03:06.269> them<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.230> thing<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.890> had

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
not eat them but the thing is I had

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.550 
not eat them but the thing is I had
cravings<00:03:09.269> for<00:03:09.989> them

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
cravings for them

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.789 
cravings for them
and<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.580> asking<00:03:11.790> myself<00:03:12.180> why<00:03:12.780> did<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> have

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
and now I'm asking myself why did I have

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.039 
and now I'm asking myself why did I have
cravings<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.790> fat<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.570> cranes<00:03:15.870> for

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
cravings for fat what it have cranes for

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:16.819 
cravings for fat what it have cranes for
avocados

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
avocados

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.910 
avocados
now<00:03:17.280> I'm<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.549> star<00:03:17.850> solution<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.680> don't<00:03:19.680> have

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
now I'm the star solution I don't have

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.220 
now I'm the star solution I don't have
any<00:03:20.130> cravings<00:03:20.610> for<00:03:21.060> fat<00:03:21.360> I'm<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:21.930> kind<00:03:22.200> of

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
any cravings for fat I'm really kind of

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.590 
any cravings for fat I'm really kind of
disgusted<00:03:23.010> by<00:03:23.190> avocados<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.180> not<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.570> I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
disgusted by avocados it's not that I

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.210 
disgusted by avocados it's not that I
had<00:03:24.840> enough<00:03:25.170> because<00:03:25.709> there<00:03:25.920> was<00:03:26.040> never

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
had enough because there was never

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.539 
had enough because there was never
really<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.610> time<00:03:26.940> when<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.600> had<00:03:27.660> too<00:03:28.530> much<00:03:28.769> but

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
really a time when I had too much but

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.330 
really a time when I had too much but
I'm<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:29.910> wondering<00:03:30.450> why<00:03:30.780> did<00:03:31.380> my<00:03:31.620> body<00:03:31.920> have

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
I'm just wondering why did my body have

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.539 
I'm just wondering why did my body have
this<00:03:32.610> desire<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> eat<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:33.930> fat<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.560> raw<00:03:35.340> till

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
this desire to eat more fat on raw till

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.360 
this desire to eat more fat on raw till
4<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:36.120> not<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.480> starch<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.769> it's<00:03:38.160> also

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
4 and not on starch it's not it's also

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.819 
4 and not on starch it's not it's also
not<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.910> I'm<00:03:39.030> eating<00:03:39.510> em<00:03:39.690> oats<00:03:40.170> all<00:03:40.530> day

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
not that I'm eating em oats all day

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.610 
not that I'm eating em oats all day
which<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.150> higher<00:03:42.359> fat<00:03:42.690> content<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.350> rice

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
which have a higher fat content and rice

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.490 
which have a higher fat content and rice
for<00:03:43.859> example<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.019> really<00:03:46.350> big

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
for example so this is a really big

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.080 
for example so this is a really big
question<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.190> honestly<00:03:47.640> don't<00:03:47.850> know<00:03:47.970> how

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
question and I honestly don't know how

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.030 
question and I honestly don't know how
to<00:03:48.299> answer<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.959> but<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.590> think<00:03:49.709> these

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to answer this but I think these

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220 
to answer this but I think these
internal<00:03:50.579> fat<00:03:50.790> cravings<00:03:51.269> were<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> reason<00:03:51.930> why

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
internal fat cravings were a reason why

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.229 
internal fat cravings were a reason why
I<00:03:52.260> ate<00:03:52.739> too<00:03:52.920> much<00:03:53.100> fat<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.549> why<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.760> didn't<00:03:54.090> lose

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
I ate too much fat and why I didn't lose

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.750 
I ate too much fat and why I didn't lose
any<00:03:54.420> weight<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.290> now<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.680> fact<00:03:56.100> number<00:03:56.519> 2

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
any weight and now the fact number 2

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.539 
any weight and now the fact number 2
which<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> very<00:03:57.630> important<00:03:58.290> point<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.890> is

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
which is a very important point it is

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.160 
which is a very important point it is
that<00:03:59.910> I<00:03:59.940> got<00:04:00.359> uncarved<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.100> easily<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.510> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
that I got uncarved so easily and the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.080 
that I got uncarved so easily and the
people<00:04:04.500> who<00:04:04.620> watched<00:04:04.950> my<00:04:05.190> channel<00:04:05.640> from<00:04:05.880> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
people who watched my channel from the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.420

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
even more fruit maybe throughout the day

I can't do it and if I don't have
bananas<00:05:11.850> I<00:05:12.060> probably<00:05:12.560> would<00:05:13.560> have<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.890> have

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
bananas I probably would have to have

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.950 
bananas I probably would have to have
dates<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.000> dates<00:05:15.240> here<00:05:15.450> are<00:05:15.630> kind<00:05:15.810> of

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
dates but the dates here are kind of

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.380 
dates but the dates here are kind of
crappy<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.710> they're<00:05:16.830> super<00:05:17.160> expensive<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:18.000> I

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
crappy and they're super expensive so I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.900 
crappy and they're super expensive so I
wouldn't<00:05:18.960> have<00:05:19.170> them<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:19.950> maybe<00:05:20.700> you

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
wouldn't have them and then maybe you

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.970 
wouldn't have them and then maybe you
have<00:05:20.940> mangoes<00:05:21.630> or<00:05:21.870> watermelon<00:05:22.530> something

have mangoes or watermelon something

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.030 
have mangoes or watermelon something

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
else and this takes up so much time to

else and this takes up so much time to
eat

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460
