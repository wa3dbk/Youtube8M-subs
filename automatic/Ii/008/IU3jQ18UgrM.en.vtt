00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 video a little special and not least 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.010
 since I'm going to talk to you about our 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 new assassin edouard quesnoy is in 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.190
 effect we do not know a little bit about 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.470
 assassin's heroes creed 4 black 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.680
 flag and all this thanks to the screenwriter of the 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.780
 Thu 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 darby mcdevitt was revealed some 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 interesting facts about the character 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.019
 so do not waste time and how 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.910
 his ensemble to discover the new hero 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.290
 of this opus 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 so first of all you have to know that 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.930
 for edouard keno and it has always been 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.970
 a choice 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 he joined the brotherhood full of his 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.330
 unlike former assassins 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.070
 who have been as destined for those lives 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.839
 but do not think that makes it sound 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 simpler story than others in 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.409
 actually it's even a lot more complicated 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 than that of the other assassins and the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.860
 how edouard is introduced to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 assassins and surround and to the Templars 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.790
 is totally new and surprising 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.860
 so remember battle irene at 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.420
 within the brotherhood is god and connor 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 joined the brotherhood following 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 tragic events in their lives and you 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 was edited by 14 years old and connor by the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.490
 justice edwards meanwhile it's getting itself 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.600
 will find in the conflict between 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.000
 assassins and the Templars 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 after learning of the existence of a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.619
 mysterious object that came home anyone 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 would possess him mighty and rich and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 naturally down the killers and the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.570
 Templars will seek to obtain it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.450
 and so begins the adventurous 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.070
 on point 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.170
 and from that moment on and ben 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.280
 edwards he'll fight he'll fight for 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.860
 to become a better man 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.539
 a pirate a woman but respectable and 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.259
 he's going to pick who's really and what 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.750
 he wants in life 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.490
 so money the power and it's this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.049
 fight that define me the character of 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.340
 fingers and actually 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.259
 edwards is practically all 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.179
 opposite of connor connor begins very 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.829
 idealistic and everything that happens to him in 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.170
 assassin's creed iii not made him a 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.240
 jaded man he thinks he's doing good but 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.920
 sown but it is not and composed for 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.259
 his efforts and the path that takes 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.789
 edouard low the opposite actually make 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.709
 douars the almost opposite of connor 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.780
 had been planned since the very beginning of 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.489
 development of the game and when the idea of 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.680
 do a saga about the canoe family is 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.390
 come is true the team wanted to show 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.030
 each of the three generations with a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.200
 way different for everyone and the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.579
 Belgian screenwriter really wanted a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 character who is a character 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.720
 totally opposed to his little one 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.239
 son so he started with a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.670
 Totally jaded cynical character 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.130
 gone out of itself there is a very marriage 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.349
 unstable he is separated from his wife who 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.329
 this last of his inability to find a 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.040
 stable job or take his 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.739
 responsibilities as a serious husband 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.720
 and yet edward fights will try 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.430
 prove that he is a worthy man 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.709
 of affection then he goes to the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.150
 antilles to become a corsair but 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.340
 he falls very quickly into the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.410
 piracy the prognoses and its 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.150
 commitment to the assassins eh ben 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.220
 they do not fully engage as soon as 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.450
 beginning there is a little lost between 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.250
 assassins and the Templars 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.079
 then he tries to make sense of his 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.760
 life and at the beginning well he has all his 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.409
 selfish goals 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.239
 but little by little these experiences 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.670
 make it focuses on other than 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.230
 itself and obviously this will make the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.209
 suspicious assassins vis-Ã -vis the douars 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.780
 even after he's welcomed within 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.180
 of the brotherhood 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.799
 and even if the low murderers believes in 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.659
 him and know he's someone 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.159
 of honest and well he saw well that he 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.819
 must rejoined the brotherhood for 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.079
 to meet his selfish desires for hackers 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.940
 and yet low they know well that 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 it's a good man and less trying to 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.940
 put it back in the right path 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.739
 but edouard low he will refuse to listen 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.109
 after a while and will also be in 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.690
 contact with Templars who will be 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.700
 interested in this character and despite 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.659
 it beats edouard he will stay focused 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.090
 on its objectives 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.799
 he wants to become infamous rich and wants 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.299
 become a big pirate and he wants 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.040
 show especially to others that he is 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.319
 better than the poor man who was the ex 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.389
 and those who will be interesting massa 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.430
 will actually be the way people are 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.329
 interested in him and the way beats 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.129
 did they react 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.870
 and to finish low you have to know that 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.090
 Edward does not like the creed 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.129
 they find it too restrictive but he 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.290
 will end up complying and will even 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.629
 started by studying the phrase nothing 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.489
 is not true everything is gone and in what 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.910
 concerns the very principles of the creed 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.769
 so 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.810
 remember never to kill an innocent 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.660
 to be invisible to others 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.489
 not compromise fraternity and ben 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.440
 Edwards plays double game with his rules 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.789
 example if you are a pirate will you 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.740
 kill innocent you then some 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.419
 merchants and from below because it is not 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.910
 not totally engaged in the brotherhood 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.680
 down it does not bother if the brotherhood 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.289
 is in danger and if his secrets are 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.150
 revealed and basically down all this is going 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.900
 create a tension between what Edward 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.330
 you from him 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.740
 does the brotherhood want of him and 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.229
 these inconstant jaw tensions in 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.840
 black line and his 7 goals and hot 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.250
 edwards who will define what it is and 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.930
 that's what it was 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.900
 basically remember this news 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.630
 infos I hope in any case that it has you 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.460
 more and that these info we have you a little 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.680
 helped to pin down the character is well 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.720
 obviously I'll see you soon for 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.789
 next videos and especially do you wear 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.720
 well and remember nothing is true 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.740
 everything is allowed 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.740
 1 the wings everyone
