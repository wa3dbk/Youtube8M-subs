Jill Meagher such a joke why would you
make<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.500> guide<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.130> unit<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.940> is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
make a guide on a unit that is

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.150 
make a guide on a unit that is
completely<00:00:12.870> useless<00:00:13.110> why<00:00:13.799> would<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.130> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
completely useless why would you do that

speed<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> fastest<00:00:43.350> helicopter

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
speed you want the fastest helicopter

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160 
speed you want the fastest helicopter
you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.840> vehicle

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you can get because this is a vehicle

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
you can get because this is a vehicle
that<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.100> valued<00:00:47.640> from<00:00:47.879> being<00:00:48.120> able<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.539> move

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that is valued from being able to move

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.950 
that is valued from being able to move
anywhere<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> map<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> be

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
anywhere in the map so it's going to be

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
anywhere in the map so it's going to be
the<00:00:51.960> fastest<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.640> five<00:00:54.030> times

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the fastest it will be about five times

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
the fastest it will be about five times
faster<00:00:54.960> than<00:00:54.989> most<00:00:55.260> commands<00:00:55.710> already<00:00:56.129> get

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
faster than most commands already get

artillery bombers and main attacks and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.270 
artillery bombers and main attacks and
that<00:01:09.420> makes<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.439> vulnerable<00:01:10.680> so

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that makes them very very vulnerable so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
that makes them very very vulnerable so
you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.240> strong<00:01:12.560> helicopter

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you want a very very strong helicopter

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
you want a very very strong helicopter
it's<00:01:14.130> worth<00:01:14.430> paying<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.939> extra<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> few<00:01:15.630> bucks

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it's worth paying that extra a few bucks

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.600 
it's worth paying that extra a few bucks
to<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> extra<00:01:16.950> armor<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.430> your

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to get all that extra armor on your

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.010 
to get all that extra armor on your
helicopter<00:01:19.850> next<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.000> we're<00:01:21.299> looking<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
helicopter next up we're looking at a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.440 
helicopter next up we're looking at a
cost<00:01:22.560> effectiveness<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.670> topic<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
cost effectiveness a topic that we

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.980 
cost effectiveness a topic that we
talked<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> past<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.369> didn't<00:01:26.729> really

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
talked in the past but we didn't really

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.190 
talked in the past but we didn't really
see<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> does<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.869> speed

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
see if it can do that is does the speed

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.120 
see if it can do that is does the speed
of<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.619> helicopter<00:01:32.329> make<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> worth<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.710> extra

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of a helicopter make it worth some extra

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.700 
of a helicopter make it worth some extra
points<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.880> our<00:01:36.060> calculations<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
points in our calculations as to the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
points in our calculations as to the
values<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.340> exactly<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:39.329> much<00:01:39.479> faster

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
values to see exactly how much faster

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.899 
values to see exactly how much faster
the<00:01:40.110> puma<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.710> compared<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.640> regular

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the puma is compared to your regular

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.950 
the puma is compared to your regular
command<00:01:42.210> vehicle<00:01:43.220> we'll<00:01:44.220> look<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.720> echo<00:01:45.720> as

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
command vehicle we'll look at echo as

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
command vehicle we'll look at echo as
being<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> long<00:01:46.590> point<00:01:46.890> because<00:01:47.280> we'll<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
being a long point because we'll be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
being a long point because we'll be
using<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.000> comparison<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> something<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
using it in comparison to something the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
using it in comparison to something the
helicopter<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.340> using<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
helicopter would actually be using that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.090 
helicopter would actually be using that
is<00:01:51.090> something<00:01:51.600> far<00:01:51.750> away<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.070> ahead

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
is something far away so let's go ahead

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.910 
is something far away so let's go ahead
and<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:54.240> n<00:01:55.049> time

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.060 

alright<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> race<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:03.260> manjeet<00:02:04.260> is<00:02:04.410> on<00:02:04.830> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
alright the race is on manjeet is on the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.820 
alright the race is on manjeet is on the
go<00:02:05.220> helicopter<00:02:05.910> has<00:02:06.390> finally<00:02:07.020> lifted<00:02:07.350> off<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
go helicopter has finally lifted off and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.480 
go helicopter has finally lifted off and
let's<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.970> how<00:02:09.210> much<00:02:09.720> faster<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.979> helicopter

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
let's see how much faster the helicopter

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.990 
let's see how much faster the helicopter
will<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:12.710> well<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:14.040> far<00:02:14.070> still<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.150> loss

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
will be well so far still in the loss

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.800 
will be well so far still in the loss
slightly<00:02:18.000> picking<00:02:18.630> up

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.260 

looks<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> might<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.640> starting<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
looks like it might just be starting to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.839 
looks like it might just be starting to
pass<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.750> now<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.920> at<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> hotel<00:02:29.520> point

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
pass it now this is at the hotel point

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.449 
pass it now this is at the hotel point
so<00:02:30.000> at<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.209> point<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:32.040> Jeep<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
so at this point just here the Jeep is

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.059 
so at this point just here the Jeep is
still<00:02:32.489> clearly<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.239> faster<00:02:33.750> vehicle<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.410> so

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
still clearly the faster vehicle and so

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.030 
still clearly the faster vehicle and so
there's<00:02:35.220> no<00:02:35.700> numeric<00:02:36.270> value<00:02:36.660> game<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.739> that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
there's no numeric value game for that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.830 
there's no numeric value game for that
now<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:38.940> start<00:02:39.209> passing<00:02:39.480> him<00:02:39.959> about<00:02:41.840> quarter

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
now we start passing him about quarter

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.300 
now we start passing him about quarter
boy<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.319> map<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.300> he<00:02:45.300> will<00:02:45.599> hit<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
boy at the map and he will hit with a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:56.949 
boy at the map and he will hit with a
slight<00:02:48.090> lead<00:02:49.489> he<00:02:50.489> will<00:02:50.790> gain<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:53.720> total<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.260 

pudding<00:02:57.959> lands<00:02:58.440> gotta<00:02:58.709> land

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.060 

the<00:03:05.270> Jeep<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.630> actually<00:03:05.930> faster<00:03:06.080> full-on

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
the Jeep is actually faster full-on

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.930 
the Jeep is actually faster full-on
faster<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> Jeep<00:03:07.880> wins<00:03:09.220> helicopters<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.520> no

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
faster the Jeep wins helicopters have no

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.930 
faster the Jeep wins helicopters have no
speed<00:03:11.300> advantage<00:03:11.570> at<00:03:12.140> all<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.850> it

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
speed advantage at all so that it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.130 
speed advantage at all so that it
might've<00:03:14.090> been<00:03:14.180> disappointing<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.900> few

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
might've been disappointing to a few

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.000 
might've been disappointing to a few
people<00:03:16.240> but<00:03:17.240> it's<00:03:17.450> not<00:03:17.510> all<00:03:17.990> that<00:03:18.620> surprising

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
people but it's not all that surprising

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.040 
people but it's not all that surprising
so<00:03:19.670> helicopters<00:03:20.660> have<00:03:20.959> two<00:03:22.150> basic<00:03:23.150> purposes

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
so helicopters have two basic purposes

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.750 
so helicopters have two basic purposes
on<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.500> battlefield<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:27.500> first<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:28.040> get<00:03:28.520> to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
on the battlefield the first is get to

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.510 
on the battlefield the first is get to
obscure<00:03:29.450> locations<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:31.070> are<00:03:31.100> hard<00:03:31.459> to

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
obscure locations that are hard to

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.370 
obscure locations that are hard to
defend<00:03:31.940> these<00:03:32.840> are<00:03:33.020> more<00:03:33.170> often

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
defend these are more often

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.890 
defend these are more often
reinforcement<00:03:34.340> points<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.570> will<00:03:35.750> allow

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
reinforcement points and this will allow

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.900 
reinforcement points and this will allow
the<00:03:35.930> transfer<00:03:36.260> helicopter<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.040> escape<00:03:37.430> very

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
the transfer helicopter to escape very

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.440 
the transfer helicopter to escape very
quickly<00:03:38.209> if<00:03:39.070> danger<00:03:40.070> is<00:03:40.280> present<00:03:40.700> because

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
quickly if danger is present because

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.270 
quickly if danger is present because
they<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.870> skate<00:03:42.080> very<00:03:42.380> quickly<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:43.010> they

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
they can skate very quickly and they

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.000 
they can skate very quickly and they
don't<00:03:43.400> have<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.670> travel<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.090> roads<00:03:44.860> they<00:03:45.860> can

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
don't have to travel on roads they can

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.490 
don't have to travel on roads they can
also<00:03:46.160> move<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.700> another<00:03:46.970> point<00:03:47.390> much<00:03:48.200> faster

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
also move to another point much faster

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.380 
also move to another point much faster
than<00:03:49.160> most<00:03:49.580> grand<00:03:50.480> vehicles<00:03:51.080> will<00:03:51.440> be<00:03:51.620> able<00:03:51.709> to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
than most grand vehicles will be able to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.940 
than most grand vehicles will be able to
since<00:03:53.390> they're<00:03:53.510> also<00:03:53.660> evading<00:03:54.170> roads<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.770> also

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
since they're also evading roads it also

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.380 
since they're also evading roads it also
means<00:03:55.130> they're<00:03:55.340> probably<00:03:55.730> going<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.270> be

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
means they're probably going to be

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.150 
means they're probably going to be
evading<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.080> enemy<00:03:57.620> which<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.370> quite<00:03:58.610> good<00:03:58.820> a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
evading the enemy which is quite good a

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.010 
evading the enemy which is quite good a
second<00:04:01.160> use<00:04:01.340> for<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.090> transport<00:04:02.420> helicopter

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
second use for the transport helicopter

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.790 
second use for the transport helicopter
is<00:04:03.250> for<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> flanking<00:04:04.820> maneuver<00:04:05.330> if<00:04:05.800> your

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
is for a flanking maneuver if your

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.800 
is for a flanking maneuver if your

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
helicopters are very very vulnerable and

if you intend to use them in a more
permanent<00:04:30.080> basis<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:31.190> should<00:04:31.370> have<00:04:31.550> some<00:04:31.790> air

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030

as<00:04:33.979> they're<00:04:34.370> moving<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:34.880> becomes<00:04:35.510> very<00:04:35.930> very

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
as they're moving it becomes very very

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.350 
as they're moving it becomes very very
easy<00:04:36.770> for<00:04:37.010> your<00:04:37.250> opponent<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.700> pick<00:04:37.940> them<00:04:38.150> off

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
easy for your opponent to pick them off

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
and if they get picked off you will want

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.940 
and if they get picked off you will want
