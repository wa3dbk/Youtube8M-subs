00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:08.849
 hola soy manuel becerra and this is 4 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.310
 today is September 16 and this is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.860
 the status of my pc did not want to show them 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.170
 nothing more here as my corals were 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 quickly as you can see from this side 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 I have my pompoms that have grown 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
 quite on this side have also been 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 started to spread around here I have a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.920
 anemone that is now closed by 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.920
 the light that I currently have 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 and it's being political, they're 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.000
 growing very well that clear day is already 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.070
 I closed my acro here not recovered 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 I know if you remember in a previous video 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 had shown that he was dying 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 catch the truth he recovered quite a bit and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 it comes again with a lot of color and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.920
 a lot of growth 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 this mountain is also very good to them 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.540
 he did not feel at all this is to be 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.350
 public are also good here and for 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.269
 here I have my mushrooms I do not know but there 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.479
 are these are the blues these are 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.670
 some red my coconut walk some record already 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.860
 around here I have a bear association 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 song to see there we will look at the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 cover is also closing and at 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 background I have another record already and I do not know if it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 they gave an account in the video that I have to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.929
 some bags these are corals that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.429
 I just arrived today just 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.020
 I just finished them and acclimatize and 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.550
 right now I'm going to put them then let me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.550
 I take it out and show you how it looks 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.390
 to see here are the corals of this 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.320
 side we have a 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.180
 duncan 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.370
 obviously as he just put it then 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.460
 it has not been opened 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.619
 and on this side we have some acropods 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.119
 this more or less supposedly colored 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.590
 blue plus that hour by type of 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.409
 light that I have that you do not notice anything this 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.380
 It's like a green water more or less since 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.170
 I read back is a purple color are the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.650
 really very nice and well let's see 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 tomorrow they open 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.560
 how do they look and remember? 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.390
 also just corals and compare 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.860
 they finish here metal and all that put the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.240
 in the bottom of the tank never 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.509
 put them where they are going to leave them 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.240
 definitely because they have to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.120
 also acclimatize to the light 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.160
 then when they just put corals 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
 so first put them in the most 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.750
 get out of the fish tank which is where they come in 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.450
 less light so that it does not reach them so 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.550
 direct and as the days go by 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.620
 approximately two weeks the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.030
 they can go up little by little until 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.690
 reach the final position where the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.580
 go to put very well 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.690
 this would be all for the moment if you 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180
 like videos I invite you to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.709

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.709
 this would be all thank you very much
