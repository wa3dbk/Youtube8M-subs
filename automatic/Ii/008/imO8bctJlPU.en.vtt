00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.860
 pigmalion project today I have here my 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.110
 Sister Maria for contributing and we are going to 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.780
 make a video talking about the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.699
 snacks because we've seen that we 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.579
 it's a little crazy when it comes to 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.380
 decide snack and it's not that hard there 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.589
 many things that can be amended there 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.640
 many things that you can dine and 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.039
 it's also very funny because things 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.680
 that you can have a snack you can dine 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.110
 so let's make a 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.360
 small snack and dinner lists 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.030
 to help and from 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 there you can continue to build 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.440
 your own menu 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.440
 for 25 pesetas protein snacks 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.160

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 play with flavors 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.760

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.329

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.410

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.890
 good but something good 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.050
 of the cows 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.450
 lasagna proteica 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.450
 not that way

 Cadiz 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.400
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:00.640
 the ideas if I keep thinking that the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.270
 man in the 'millionaire' box is that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.580
 sir does not want this is the quark method 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:11.920
 but we're going to 43 the cycle of which but not 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.540
 they are ideas and you already know you have to look 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.100
 provided that the content of dinners in 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.660
 a protein content that conforms 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.549
 let's learn to differentiate 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.930
 types of macronutrients as we know 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.810
 perfectly when we are eating in 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.790
 protein and of course remember to read 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.700
 the labels because there are many things 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.880
 that we think are protein and not what 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.850
 are and others that we think are not and 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.950
 they are not like for example the eggs that 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.870
 everyone thinks they are fat and 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.110
 although they have fat they are actually 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.660
 enough protests are a good dinner 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.100
 we read labels we look for food 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.350
 protein and we go to bed with a 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.600
 bit hungry and snacks as 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.840
 same we can go combining we can go 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.880
 always looking for some type of food 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.290
 protein or even dairy products that have 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.300
 more protein content and do not have 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.750
 carbohydrates always look at 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.750
 labels 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.300
 well I remind you that you have recipes that 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.039
 we are raising both our 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.720
 respective channels and we leave them in the 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.039
 information box you can
