 and the illegal duck house tied to the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 sports in the state of mexico continue 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.069
 representing a severe problem for 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.410
 ecosystems mainly for 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.150
 these birds that could then face the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 extinction in a short time 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.969
 our correspondent guadeloupe colin us 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.969
 extensive information 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.360
 not being enough the activity of the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.770
 legal hunters in the activities that 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.510
 are carried out in the season 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 sporting duck hunting in the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 wetlands and wetlands of the state of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 Mexico from November to March 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
 for yourself the worsening of the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 situation of these ecosystems that 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.820
 they serve as a safeguard for 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.500
 endemic aquatic species and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.629
 migrants who have to make a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 double or triple effort so that your 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.890
 population does not face the danger of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.150
 extinction the hunt in the history of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.339
 humanity has been a practice 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.500
 millenary in which in past ages 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.809
 met the objectives of providing the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 Food and clothing of populations 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.530
 ancestral but now the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.210
 value that represents an animal has been 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 devalued to the point of degrading 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.620
 this economic activity first 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 need in a sports hunt if 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.860
 it is true that this dynamic of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 hunting generates an economic spill 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.910
 important for the inhabitants of the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.530
 areas where also develops 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.600
 generates controversy at the moment of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 understand the posture and the psyche of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.160
 hunters who practice this sport 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 but what about hunter crops 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.729
 according to regulatory authorities to the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 environmental protection of the state of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.550
 Mexico these characters are the ones from 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 true 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.690
 pose a danger to these biomes already 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.880
 than the current one without complying with the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.010
 protection of wildlife cause a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 important damage to the natural environment what 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.330
 what happens with the crops is that there is no 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.540
 a quantification of this I can you 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.320
 say yes even if a sneak enters 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.430
 hunt to the lagoon we do not know to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.620
 unless we discover that he exercised that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.350
 hunting therefore we do not know how many 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.780
 ducks has taken out and if we do not detect it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 him and others because we can not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.420
 quantify how many how many are with this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.730
 we assume that the problem is more 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 close to what we imagine not only 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.510
 it's about worrying about the killing 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.399
 or extinction of other species of 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.980
 black ivory market and furs 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.360
 exotic we must also adopt a 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.640
 protection posture of the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.620
 local biodiversity where at 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.450
 less this type of activities is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.880
 develop in accordance with the laws of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.950
 conservation that each region has in the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.510
 state of mexico reported for green 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.510
