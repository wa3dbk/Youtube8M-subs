00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello creative this video will deal with 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.090
 how to make the salt paste 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.190
 I had previously made a video about 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.200
 this but I think it is necessary 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.360
 update it to present it from a 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.260
 more practical and understandable 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.900
 the ingredients are a cup of flour 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.330
 three quarters of a cup of salt three quarters 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.990
 of white glue diluted with water 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.700
 especially if your glue is very thick 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.280
 If you want you can add a 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.530
 teaspoon of cooking oil but not 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.650
 too much because this could change the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.930
 consistency of your pasta remember that 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.780
 this recipe is special the glue 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.830
 white will make your figures last longer than 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.420
 any way 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.400
 you must keep them away from places 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.680
 humid 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.350
 it does not matter if you do not use the amounts 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.690
 very exactly at the moment you love 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.010
 is the pasta you will notice if you need 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.010
 more water or more flour 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.430
 Y 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.420
 First mix the flour with the salt 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.420
 and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.370
 prepare your white glue 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.150
 do not 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.130
 and then add it little by little to it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.130
 time you are mixing your pasta 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.970
 but no 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.970
 to dough with your hands 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.240
 two 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.590
 If you feel very dry your pasta adds only 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.590
 a little more water 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.229
 neither should it be very watery 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.610
 wrap your pasta in plastic form 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.280
 that no air can last more than 15 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.090
 days although I recommend not saving it 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 more of that time 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.870
 add color with acrylic paints and 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.280
 it will be necessary to add a little more 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.920
 flour so that it does not change 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.430
 consistency of the pasta 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.430
 ah 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.599
 if your pasta has a day or more saved 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.840
 you will have to knead it again at 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.970
 use it and add a little more flour 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.910
 this is because the salt content goes 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.489
 absorbing humidity the figures are 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.760
 They can bake or they can also be dried 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.069
 to the air I hope you have been useful this 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.090
 See information in the next 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.090
