00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 and 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.190
 the programming career of 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.620
 videogames that consists of the range 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.570
 of the most technological video games more 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.390
 close to engineering or to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.220
 computer science that consists of learning to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.320
 be an expert in technology for 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.320
 videogames consoles in the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.090
 computers programming languages 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 methodology of this programming networks 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.050
 artificial intelligence very much 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.580
 also of graphic render in three 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 dimensions of course cards 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 graphics and it's actually the programmer 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.280
 of video games is what gives life to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.690
 functional link video game is a 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.520
 technology expert for the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.050
 entertainment to be able to access the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.090
 videogame programming career 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.899
 of that there are three main avenues of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.550
 access 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.829
 the first is through the baccalaureate 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090
 Spanish we can process the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 records from the first of 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.719
 baccalaureate but we recommend 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.629
 earnestly have second of 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.420
 completed baccalaureate and pau la pau no 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.059
 is necessary because the selectivity 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 it is not convalidable myself I spoke it in 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.090
 Europe day is a subject only 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 Spanish us as a university 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.880
 polytechnic we can not demand it but the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.880
 recommend 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 then the second access itinerary 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 it is through the formative cycles of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 middle grade and then higher grade 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.479
 We can process student records 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.630
 who have obtained the middle grade and have 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.520
 the access exam approved at the level 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.440
 formative training but of the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 same way we recommend finishing a 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.610
 higher grade to access the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.530
 school the third way of access is to 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.270
 through university studies and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 people who have already completed the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.299
 reading with university in any 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.520
 European country or found to 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.960
 half of taking another degree 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 university we can make them a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.460
 transfer to school just about 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 minimum quality criteria in your bone 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.299
 file and portfolio the departures 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.830
 professionals of the students of the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.630
 videogame programming career 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.119
 they are huge 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.909
 to get a clear idea of ​​the year 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.709
 last we had five times more offers 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.600
 of work on the table that students 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.490
 available to work alone in the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.929
 valencian community and telling what 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.030
 that we have but Spain or others 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.150
 countries to come out professionals with huge 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.350
 is a graduate of de nigris program 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.930
 index 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.180
 highly valued by the company is capable of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.220
 work on triple-a titles because it's 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.230
 prepared for it is able to work 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.720
 in small indie titles and especially 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.340
 also very capable of undertaking and riding 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 The only its own development studio 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.660
 of video games made from school 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.330
 We have several framework agreements for 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.880
 facilitate the student's access to 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.750
 specialized labor market in Spain ' 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.580
 Anyway our 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.410
 professional recommendation is not that the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.170
 student stays in Spain but that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.940
 try to access the global market at 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.100
 global video game market 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.930
 for example starting with united kingdom in 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.490
 these moments is the engine of europe in 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.950
 the world of video game development 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.450
 it's an excellent first step for a 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.850
 international career in the world of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.950
 video games also happens that many 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.930
 companies that know us well come to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.210
 sign the student directly here at 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.430
 school we have cases even of the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.220
 best students since the first year 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.380
 at the end of the first course they are signed 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.060
 by multinationals and by more companies 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.040
 little 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.239
 I believe that the strong point of the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.239
 videogame programming career 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.920
 of sat are your teachers we have the 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.900
 first swords of the industry the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.790
 Spanish video game we have a 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.760
 designers who have received awards from 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.830
 gamelab and other institutions of better 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.930
 best design better design levels 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.269
 mobile game a lot of distinctions 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.040
 Besides having brighter network 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.050
 that the professional valid in the fact of 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.080
 that we have a very faculty team 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.000
 expertized very focused and above all 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.590
 He also knows how to transmit his 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.630
 experience one of the main 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.549
 values ​​that we have in school is the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.130
 experience of our faculty that 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.959
 it is tremendously valuable that 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.959
 we hope that they transmit to the students
