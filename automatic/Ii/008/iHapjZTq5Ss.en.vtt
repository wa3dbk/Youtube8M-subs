00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.330
 Today there is a handy tip from 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.910
 me and I want to show you how 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 this beautiful flower is left over 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 from toilet paper the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 toilet paper rolls respectively 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.930
 from the kitchen paper roll to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 takes the manufacturing is very easy 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.869
 I need glue a pair of scissors 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.910
 roll of in toilet paper and one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:42.690
 Press roll of the kitchen paper first 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 I give you something flat by the way 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:57.300
 on top of each other tailor first 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:01.579
 in the middle and then again 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.579
 from the half half 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.410
 important it is the opening of course 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.410
 to point outward 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.060
 so now I have some flowers 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.060
 leaves 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:55.480
 I do the same with myself now 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 but four do not roll once 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.930
 cut through 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.140
 both have together 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.040
 so 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.489
 You can then roll out of the kitchen paper roll 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.750
 slightly larger petals form 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.750
 then you can see the difference 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.690
 and then the whole thing is together 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.830
 Of course you want to watch how you like it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.830
 that's the same size 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.720
 Now the glue is used 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.270
 brush pages with glue 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:47.510
 I always take you two first 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.510
 glue together a little bit 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.610
 so now the other two sides 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.810
 meet 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 seconds 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.940
 so now the two sides 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:36.300
 connected with each other 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:40.550
 the adhesive arise, I have a 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.550
 bit dry is loosen up nunmal 

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:07.099
 push a little bit 

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:08.569
 and I'll leave that for a few minutes now 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:15.529
 that really is with each other 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:20.599
 connects and sticks it looks like that 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:23.329
 So far, I'll take it from now 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:27.139
 the toilet paper roll the me 

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:37.369
 before also cut the power 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:43.669
 Run from both sides and adhesive are there 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:46.419
 pure by pushing a bit that is 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.419
 important 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.299
 I do that now on all four sides 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:49.460
 now all this has to dry a while 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:54.860
 that then holds to fix 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.810
 I have now cling to it 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.070
 it really still stays in shape and 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.510
 nice stops and so it looks 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.410
 when it's done I already have 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.290
 times at the beginning one can then one 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.130
 put a nail in the wall and did that 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.380
 pendant 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.250
 Of course, who wants to do that? 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:19.670
 paint in the desired yes it would have 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.390
 also a nice gift and a lot of fun 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.390
 when copying
