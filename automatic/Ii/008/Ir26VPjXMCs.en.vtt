00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
first place so maybe you should go over

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.340 
first place so maybe you should go over
the<00:04:28.940> slave<00:04:29.150> king<00:04:29.450> if<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.660> want<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.230> know

could fight her and things had a little

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
could fight her and things had a little
bit<00:04:32.450> more<00:04:32.600> interesting<00:04:32.720> with<00:04:32.960> characters<00:04:33.320> on

a Calif because strong and really adept
in<00:04:36.050> combat<00:04:36.410> but<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:37.190> little<00:04:37.669> bit<00:04:37.760> less<00:04:38.090> likely

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
in combat but a little bit less likely

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.909
