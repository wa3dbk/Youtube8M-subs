 finish the dreamers words 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.010
 i'm going with two strapped friend 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.030
 friend scotch 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.539
 smartphones 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.539
 but one or other 920 and stations 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.449
 May Song sees 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.859
 stabilization 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.859
 There is such a dual access function if 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.159
 stabilizer how do you remember which 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.810
 can not turn off the years 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 work constantly 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.220
 St. Petersburg people will meet 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.510
 we'll see 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.640
 how well does it work 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 stabilization 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 they are watching 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 by name must be objectively compared 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.220
 each other and still 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.530
 therefore attached 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.790
 resource and I will not be exactly the same 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 me in hand 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.480
 Now here I was walking down the street in the United States for this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.400
 transition 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.720
 and here 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.520
 you can see how 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.950
 camera showers behaves 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 with a lack of lighting 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.299
 comparison with the camera Goloseevsky this 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.700
 mesh protein because it is one of the most 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.870
 camera casting on the market 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.750
 now 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.750
 why actually the war 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.570
 because we went into the transition 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.760
 see how it looks 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.720
 I would know Khabarovsk included enabled 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.510
 AF tracking that is 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.510
 in sapporo dependency on GDP 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 state 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.830
 can also be rated worked 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.580
 somatic white balance 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 and everything else percent I'm going funeral 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.030
 a class 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.300
 stabilization time works 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.200
 right and good balance again 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 better white 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.399
 Basically samsung is famous for its 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.179
 screens 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.189
 attracted with contrast 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.849
 scream white balance 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.359
 check how strange the camera is 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.849
 and generally love the company samsung 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
