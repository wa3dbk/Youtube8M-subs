00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.050 
time either huh it did excellent not how
it<00:03:43.990> usually<00:03:44.110> does<00:03:47.340> anyway<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.730> kind<00:03:48.970> of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
it usually does anyway this is kind of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.050 
it usually does anyway this is kind of
irritating<00:03:49.270> actually<00:03:50.050> because<00:03:50.410> as<00:03:51.370> far<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.850> I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
irritating actually because as far as I

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.590 
irritating actually because as far as I
know<00:03:52.620> there<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.650> no<00:03:54.070> way<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.400> get<00:03:54.820> back<00:03:55.300> up

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
know there is no way to get back up

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.540 
know there is no way to get back up
there<00:03:55.960> to<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:57.459> safe<00:03:57.760> point<00:03:58.860> like<00:03:59.860> you<00:04:00.190> go<00:04:00.310> into

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
there to the safe point like you go into

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.620 
there to the safe point like you go into
the<00:04:00.610> center<00:04:00.940> thing<00:04:01.120> they<00:04:01.270> used<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.540> be

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
the center thing they used to be

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.370 
the center thing they used to be
kinetochore<00:04:02.140> cannon<00:04:02.700> there's<00:04:03.700> not<00:04:04.380> not

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
kinetochore cannon there's not not

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.160 
kinetochore cannon there's not not
they're<00:04:06.060> not<00:04:07.060> here<00:04:07.330> if<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.570> get<00:04:07.750> into<00:04:07.900> that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
they're not here if you get into that

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.970 
they're not here if you get into that
water<00:04:08.709> during<00:04:09.010> maybe<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:09.700> no<00:04:10.560> not<00:04:11.560> as<00:04:11.740> far<00:04:11.770> as

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
water during maybe but no not as far as

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.050 
water during maybe but no not as far as
I<00:04:12.070> know<00:04:12.130> it's<00:04:12.430> impossible<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.670> have<00:04:15.880> no

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
I know it's impossible so you have no

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.430 
I know it's impossible so you have no
choice<00:04:16.269> but<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:17.049> go<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.769> face<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.100> loss

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.990 

through<00:04:23.440> here

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.240 

now<00:04:29.000> we<00:04:29.060> got<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> long<00:04:29.630> long<00:04:30.110> stairway<00:04:30.530> full<00:04:31.099> of

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
now we got a long long stairway full of

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.850 
now we got a long long stairway full of
jumping<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.419> also<00:04:33.050> things<00:04:33.259> you<00:04:33.410> can<00:04:33.560> kill

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
jumping and also things you can kill

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.710 
jumping and also things you can kill
eventually<00:04:38.560> come<00:04:39.560> on<00:04:39.740> there<00:04:40.460> we<00:04:40.580> go<00:04:40.720> these

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
eventually come on there we go these

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.740 
eventually come on there we go these
things<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.199> forget<00:04:42.440> their<00:04:42.560> names<00:04:43.240> but<00:04:44.240> they're

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
things I forget their names but they're

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.820 
things I forget their names but they're
useful<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:47.690> you're<00:04:48.229> basically<00:04:48.590> going<00:04:48.770> to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
useful and you're basically going to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.710 
useful and you're basically going to
want<00:04:49.009> a<00:04:49.099> lot<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.280> missiles<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:49.940> dark<00:04:50.180> ammo<00:04:50.509> for

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
want a lot of missiles and dark ammo for

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.900 
want a lot of missiles and dark ammo for
this<00:04:50.900> lie<00:04:51.500> demo<00:04:51.830> actually<00:04:52.400> isn't<00:04:52.550> as<00:04:52.729> useful

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
this lie demo actually isn't as useful

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.450 
this lie demo actually isn't as useful
since<00:04:53.479> it's<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.229> light<00:04:54.440> boss<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:57.830> missiles<00:04:58.220> I

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
since it's a light boss the missiles I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.379 
since it's a light boss the missiles I
think<00:04:58.699> are<00:04:58.849> actually<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.419> most<00:04:59.509> useful<00:05:01.389> that

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
think are actually the most useful that

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.770 
think are actually the most useful that
you<00:05:02.659> know<00:05:02.780> health<00:05:04.000> since<00:05:05.000> i'ma<00:05:05.270> not<00:05:05.479> much<00:05:05.599> help

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
you know health since i'ma not much help

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.659 
you know health since i'ma not much help
I<00:05:05.900> have<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.560> can't<00:05:06.949> really<00:05:07.130> be<00:05:07.190> sure<00:05:11.319> and<00:05:12.669> I

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
I have I can't really be sure and I

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:22.360 
I have I can't really be sure and I
guess<00:05:13.970> this<00:05:14.180> will<00:05:14.330> have<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.539> do<00:05:21.159> hang<00:05:22.159> on

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
guess this will have to do hang on

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:34.670 
guess this will have to do hang on
through<00:05:22.610> here<00:05:23.710> door<00:05:24.710> down<00:05:25.009> here

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.730 

damn<00:05:35.680> it's<00:05:36.129> murky<00:05:37.199> hope<00:05:38.199> you're<00:05:38.319> not<00:05:38.379> used<00:05:38.650> to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
damn it's murky hope you're not used to

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.040 
damn it's murky hope you're not used to
it<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:40.150> it's<00:05:40.270> going<00:05:40.389> to<00:05:40.479> change<00:05:40.509> real<00:05:41.080> soon

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
it so it's going to change real soon

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.189 
it so it's going to change real soon
back<00:05:44.050> here<00:05:44.379> we<00:05:44.409> got<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.710> door<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:45.360> it<00:05:46.360> leads<00:05:46.629> to

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
back here we got a door and it leads to

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:53.760 
back here we got a door and it leads to
a<00:05:47.499> very<00:05:47.589> very<00:05:48.129> useful<00:05:48.249> item<00:05:48.699> a<00:05:52.439> grabber<00:05:53.439> boost

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
a very very useful item a grabber boost

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.579 
a very very useful item a grabber boost
and<00:05:54.809> it<00:05:55.809> also<00:05:55.960> makes<00:05:56.409> things<00:05:57.370> less<00:05:57.490> marquee<00:05:57.819> I

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
and it also makes things less marquee I

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.400 
and it also makes things less marquee I
compared<00:05:59.589> the<00:05:59.620> environment<00:06:00.219> here
