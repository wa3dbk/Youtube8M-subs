00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
assembly all because you've got laser

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
assembly all because you've got laser
etched<00:01:06.479> numbers<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.770> number

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
etched numbers so like this is number

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679

six<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.939> tube<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
six so you take this tube at the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
six so you take this tube at the
intersect<00:01:10.170> point<00:01:10.439> boom<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.799> tell<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> right

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
intersect point boom they tell you right

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
intersect point boom they tell you right
where<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> put<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.210> ahead<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> tack<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
where to put it you go ahead and tack it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
where to put it you go ahead and tack it
in<00:01:12.869> place<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.290> doesn't<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.860> any<00:01:14.040> easier

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
in place it doesn't get any easier

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.679 
in place it doesn't get any easier
because<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.759> take<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> guesswork<00:01:15.479> out

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
because they take all the guesswork out

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480

was was plugging the pieces in the right
spot<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.690> doing<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.020> bunch<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.230> tack<00:03:25.440> welds<00:03:25.800> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
spot and doing a bunch of tack welds to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.800 
spot and doing a bunch of tack welds to
get<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.220> laid<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.450> it's<00:03:27.600> all

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
get it all laid out now that it's all

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.720 
get it all laid out now that it's all
configured<00:03:28.770> we<00:03:28.950> need<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.190> pull<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.550> thing

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
configured we need to pull this thing

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.490 
configured we need to pull this thing
out<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.030> way<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.630> can<00:03:30.780> get<00:03:30.930> full<00:03:31.140> welds

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
out of the way so we can get full welds

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.809 
out of the way so we can get full welds
all<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> way<00:03:31.860> around<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> with<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.610> out<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
all the way around and with it out of

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:33.949 
all the way around and with it out of
the<00:03:32.880> Jeep<00:03:33.090> it's<00:03:33.270> going<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> be<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.600> little<00:03:33.840> bit

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the Jeep it's going to be a little bit

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.660 
the Jeep it's going to be a little bit
easier<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.410> manipulate<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:35.040> think<00:03:35.340> actually<00:03:35.489> we

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
easier to manipulate I think actually we

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.590 
easier to manipulate I think actually we
should<00:03:35.790> go<00:03:35.880> ahead<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.090> send<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.420> thing<00:03:36.510> out

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
should go ahead and send this thing out

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.790 
should go ahead and send this thing out
powder<00:03:36.870> coat<00:03:37.110> when<00:03:37.230> we're<00:03:37.350> done<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.680> think

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
powder coat when we're done I think

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:46.200 
powder coat when we're done I think
it'll<00:03:38.100> look<00:03:38.160> great

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.290 

you
