elastic bands every couple of inches the
purpose<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.840> procedure<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> keep<00:01:01.800> all

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
purpose of this procedure is to keep all

purpose of this procedure is to keep all
the<00:01:02.160> hair<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.760> place<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.329> prevent<00:01:03.899> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the hair in one place and prevent it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
the hair in one place and prevent it
from<00:01:04.019> movement<00:01:04.470> without<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> trim<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
from movement without the trim in the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.390 
from movement without the trim in the
ends<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.229> later<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.680> I'll<00:01:07.830> bring<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.159> hair

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
ends so later on when I'll bring my hair

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370 
ends so later on when I'll bring my hair
to<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> front<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.180> cut<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.350> very

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to the front to cut it it will be very

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
to the front to cut it it will be very
easy<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.610> lowest<00:01:14.909> elastic<00:01:15.390> band

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
easy to do the lowest elastic band

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
easy to do the lowest elastic band
should<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:16.080> above<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> level<00:01:17.040> where

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
should be right above the level where

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.870 
should be right above the level where
you<00:01:17.460> plan<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> cut<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.330> hair

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.080 

and<00:01:24.500> here<00:01:25.500> comes<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.980> excited<00:01:26.520> moment<00:01:26.940> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and here comes that excited moment of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.630 
and here comes that excited moment of
choppin<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.810> hair<00:01:28.080> off<00:01:28.230> right<00:01:29.070> below<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
choppin my hair off right below the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.680 
choppin my hair off right below the
elastic<00:01:30.120> bands<00:01:34.790> clearly<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.210> done

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
elastic bands clearly we're not done

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.110 
elastic bands clearly we're not done
here<00:01:36.990> yet<00:01:37.160> once<00:01:38.160> you<00:01:38.280> remove<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.700> hairband

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
here yet once you remove the hairband

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.290 
here yet once you remove the hairband
you'll<00:01:39.660> see<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.380> ends<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.830> v-shaped<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
you'll see that the ends are v-shaped so

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.270 
you'll see that the ends are v-shaped so
to<00:01:42.360> even<00:01:42.690> them<00:01:42.870> out<00:01:42.990> I'll<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> technique

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to even them out I'll use the technique

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.820 
to even them out I'll use the technique
from<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.640> previous<00:01:44.910> video<00:01:45.360> I'll<00:01:46.260> divide<00:01:46.620> my

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
from my previous video I'll divide my

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.320 
from my previous video I'll divide my
hair<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.310> middle<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.820> where<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
hair in the middle right where it's the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.300 
hair in the middle right where it's the
shortest<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.080> bring<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.800> front

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
shortest and bring it to the front

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.610 
shortest and bring it to the front
I'll<00:01:50.760> section<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> horizontal<00:01:51.720> layer<00:01:52.290> right

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
less hair to cut at a time see how the

should<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.820> all<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.030> same<00:02:00.510> length<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.680> grab

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
should be all the same length so I grab

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
should be all the same length so I grab
the<00:02:02.130> right<00:02:02.310> section<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:03.030> brush<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.510> out<00:02:03.600> very

and very firmly right above the shortest

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.030 
and very firmly right above the shortest
hair<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.320> can<00:02:22.470> make<00:02:22.650> your<00:02:22.680> cuts

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
hair then you can make your cuts

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.220 
hair then you can make your cuts
parallel<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.820> your<00:02:23.940> fingers<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.050> basically

on the other side you repeat the exact

00:02:40.890 --> 00:03:01.760 
on the other side you repeat the exact
same<00:02:40.980> steps<00:02:59.600> now<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.930> take<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.140> mirror<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
same steps now you can take a mirror and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.950 
same steps now you can take a mirror and
see<00:03:01.980> if<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.190> did<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> good<00:03:02.640> job<00:03:02.700> if<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.750> don't

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
divide it only in two sections but those

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.400 
divide it only in two sections but those
of<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.820> with<00:03:30.000> thicker<00:03:30.210> hair<00:03:30.630> could<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.140> more

of you with thicker hair could have more

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.560 
of you with thicker hair could have more
sections<00:03:32.040> because<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.910> more<00:03:33.090> sections

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
sections because of the more sections

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.570 
sections because of the more sections
you<00:03:33.690> have<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.470> easier<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.950> will<00:03:35.100> be<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.520> a
