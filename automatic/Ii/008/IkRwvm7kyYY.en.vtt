create mask for something else right oh

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
create mask for something else right oh
we<00:00:41.820> haven't<00:00:41.940> thought<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.629> right

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
we haven't thought about that all right

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
we haven't thought about that all right
let's<00:00:42.930> make<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.100> just

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
let's make that so it's really just

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.119 
let's make that so it's really just
trying<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> make<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
trying to make sure we got we and

would<00:00:58.530> say<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> inspiration<00:00:59.190> behind<00:00:59.989> this<00:01:00.989> or

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
would say the inspiration behind this or

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.799 
would say the inspiration behind this or
at<00:01:01.289> least<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.559> aspect<00:01:01.890> was<00:01:02.070> Cody<00:01:02.510> Cody<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
at least one aspect was Cody Cody was a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
at least one aspect was Cody Cody was a
developed<00:01:04.530> by<00:01:04.589> Microsoft<00:01:05.010> Research<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
developed by Microsoft Research and it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.370 
developed by Microsoft Research and it
was<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.320> game<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> allowed<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:09.170> targeted<00:01:10.170> for

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
was a game that allowed a targeted for

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
was a game that allowed a targeted for
kids<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.970> learn<00:01:12.090> programming

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
kids to make to learn programming

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
kids to make to learn programming
through<00:01:12.750> visual<00:01:13.140> icons<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.860> visual<00:01:14.520> language

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
through visual icons a visual language

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.450 
through visual icons a visual language
and<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.570> saw<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.470> saw<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.830> kids<00:01:17.280> just

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and so we saw that we saw how kids just

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.340 
and so we saw that we saw how kids just
gravitated<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> actually<00:01:18.689> able<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.049> make

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
gravitated to actually able to make

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.190 
gravitated to actually able to make
their<00:01:19.979> own<00:01:20.009> games<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.900> took

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
their own games with this so we took

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.760 
their own games with this so we took
that<00:01:22.259> inspiration<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.650> made<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that inspiration and actually made it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
that inspiration and actually made it
more<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> two<00:01:26.580> point<00:01:26.820> O<00:01:27.000> version<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
more of a like a two point O version and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.880 
more of a like a two point O version and
added<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:28.950> ass<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:30.329> our<00:01:30.479> editor<00:01:30.890> that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
added that to our ass to our editor that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
added that to our ass to our editor that
really<00:01:32.100> helps<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.360> breath<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.810> not

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
really helps you know the breath I'm not

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
really helps you know the breath I'm not
just<00:01:34.170> creating<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.650> world<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:35.369> adding

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
just creating your world actually adding

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.200 
just creating your world actually adding
logic<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.150> today<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> detail<00:01:37.619> about

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
actually go through in spark you can

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.570 
actually go through in spark you can
make<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:41.990> Gotham<00:01:42.560> look<00:01:42.710> like<00:01:42.920> how<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.280> create

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
make like Gotham look like how to create

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.490 
make like Gotham look like how to create
their<00:01:43.700> own<00:01:43.820> app<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:44.990> French<00:01:45.229> playing

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
their own app and have French playing

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.020

canyons what kind of time of day then

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.960 
canyons what kind of time of day then
you<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:08.660> add<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:10.069> there's<00:02:10.910> different

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
you can add that so there's different

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.490 
you can add that so there's different
ways<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.269> approach<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.870> but<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.260> know<00:02:12.290> where

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
ways to approach it but you know where

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.320 
ways to approach it but you know where
we're<00:02:12.650> at<00:02:12.680> right<00:02:12.890> here<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.280> an<00:02:13.670> empty<00:02:14.150> world

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
we're at right here is an empty world

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.380 
we're at right here is an empty world
and<00:02:15.050> then<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.010> add<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.400> props<00:02:16.700> props<00:02:17.090> or

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
and then you can add a props props or

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.680 
and then you can add a props props or
houses<00:02:17.660> trees<00:02:18.290> ferns<00:02:19.090> objects<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.300> then

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
houses trees ferns objects to it then

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.540 
houses trees ferns objects to it then
obviously<00:02:20.810> enemies<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.860> actually<00:02:22.100> add<00:02:22.250> life

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
obviously enemies to actually add life

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.270 
obviously enemies to actually add life
to<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.300> your<00:02:23.420> game<00:02:23.630> it's<00:02:24.620> very<00:02:24.890> simple

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
to it to your game it's very simple

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.949 
to it to your game it's very simple
we've<00:02:25.519> got<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.850> language<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:26.600> based<00:02:26.840> on

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
we've got this language it's based on

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.110 
we've got this language it's based on
the<00:02:27.019> window<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.890> when<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.280> happens<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:28.910> this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the window so when this happens do this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.449 
the window so when this happens do this
so<00:02:29.720> there's<00:02:29.870> condition<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.560> an<00:02:30.680> action<00:02:31.040> it's

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
so there's condition and an action it's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.420 
so there's condition and an action it's
very<00:02:31.640> approachable<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:33.709> can<00:02:33.860> say<00:02:33.980> when<00:02:34.190> left
