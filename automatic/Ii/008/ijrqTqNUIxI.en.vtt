Victor works 2009 and I'm going to
introduce<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.410> little<00:00:10.559> bit<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
introduce you to a little bit of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.049 
introduce you to a little bit of
old-school<00:00:11.370> tech<00:00:11.969> drawing<00:00:13.580> I'd<00:00:14.580> say<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:14.880> got

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
old-school tech drawing I'd say I've got

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.939 
old-school tech drawing I'd say I've got
these<00:00:15.179> two<00:00:15.509> lines<00:00:15.809> these<00:00:16.080> represent<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.680> walls

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
these two lines these represent my walls

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.220 
these two lines these represent my walls
and<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:18.000> want<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and what I really want to do is to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290 
and what I really want to do is to
calculate<00:00:19.770> where<00:00:20.279> my<00:00:20.460> Philip's<00:00:20.850> should<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.180> if

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
calculate where my Philip's should be if

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
calculate where my Philip's should be if
I<00:00:21.449> know<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.840> size<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> fella<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.830> want

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I know the size of the fella that I want

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.720 
I know the size of the fella that I want
where<00:00:23.789> should<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:25.189> center<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.310> my<00:00:26.460> circle

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
where should the center of my circle

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.510 
where should the center of my circle
Philip<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:28.279> let's<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.699> our<00:00:29.939> offset<00:00:30.300> tool

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
Philip be let's look at our offset tool

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.360 
Philip be let's look at our offset tool
click<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.640> off<00:00:32.790> object<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:34.079> offset<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.190> let's

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
click on off object to offset and let's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.340 
click on off object to offset and let's
just<00:00:35.550> check<00:00:35.760> I'm<00:00:36.000> gonna<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.329> an<00:00:36.420> offset<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.930> 2

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
just check I'm gonna have an offset of 2

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.180 
just check I'm gonna have an offset of 2
meters<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:38.250> 6<00:00:38.700> feet<00:00:38.879> 6<00:00:39.239> inches<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.160> click<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
meters or 6 feet 6 inches so click on

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.360 
meters or 6 feet 6 inches so click on
the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.579> line<00:00:41.899> click<00:00:42.899> click<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> second

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the first line click click on the second

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.200 
the first line click click on the second
line<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.850> click<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.969> point<00:00:47.969> there

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
line and click so that point there

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.830 
line and click so that point there
should<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> center<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:49.890> circle

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
should be the center of my circle

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040 
should be the center of my circle
ideally<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:53.750> bicycling<00:00:54.750> angle

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
ideally we need a bicycling angle

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
ideally we need a bicycling angle
between<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.440> two<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> these<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
between the two of these and this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
between the two of these and this
constraint<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
constraint here will do it for you the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.750 
constraint here will do it for you the
smart<00:00:59.579> each<00:01:00.920> we<00:01:01.920> don't<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
smart each we don't really need that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
smart each we don't really need that
because<00:01:02.910> we've<00:01:03.180> dust<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.809> offset<00:01:04.229> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
because we've dust on this offset but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.580 
because we've dust on this offset but
I'll<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.040> show<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.430> works

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
I'll just show you how that works

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.920 
I'll just show you how that works
touch<00:01:07.590> each<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.950> those<00:01:08.070> lines<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.760> there's<00:01:09.720> my

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
touch each of those lines now there's my

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.990 
touch each of those lines now there's my
bisecting<00:01:10.530> angle<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:10.979> through<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:12.560> now

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
bisecting angle right through there now

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
bisecting angle right through there now
the<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.540> arc<00:01:15.869> should<00:01:16.320> work<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the way that an arc should work is that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.039 
the way that an arc should work is that
an<00:01:17.490> action<00:01:17.880> come<00:01:18.119> off<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.420> line<00:01:18.720> here

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
an action come off this line here

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499 
an action come off this line here
perpendicular<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.100> run<00:01:20.850> through<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> point

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
perpendicular and run through this point

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.749 
perpendicular and run through this point
if<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.380> start<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.860> point<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.369> back<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
if I start at this point and go back to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.170 
if I start at this point and go back to
that<00:01:23.909> line<00:01:25.159> perpendicular<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> start

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
that line perpendicular that's the start

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
that line perpendicular that's the start
of<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.450> arc<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> arc<00:01:28.770> will<00:01:28.920> come

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
of my arc there and the arc will come

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.289 
of my arc there and the arc will come
all<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:29.369> around<00:01:29.640> until<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.939> hits<00:01:30.119> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
all the way around until it hits this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.130 
all the way around until it hits this
line<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.430> point<00:01:32.869> draw<00:01:33.869> back<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
line so back to this point draw back to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.100 
line so back to this point draw back to
my<00:01:34.439> wall<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.400> my<00:01:35.579> wall<00:01:35.820> line<00:01:36.110> object

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.679 
my wall or back to my wall line object
perpendicular<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.579> arc<00:01:38.850> should<00:01:39.180> start<00:01:39.509> at

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
perpendicular so my arc should start at

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.380 
perpendicular so my arc should start at
this<00:01:39.810> point<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:41.009> round<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.729> touch<00:01:42.119> that

this point and go round and touch that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.370 
this point and go round and touch that
point<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> center<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.070> arc

point and that's the center of my arc

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
point and that's the center of my arc
let's<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.770> correct<00:01:46.950> let's<00:01:47.430> draw<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
let's see if I'm correct let's draw a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.319 
let's see if I'm correct let's draw a
short<00:01:47.939> wall<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:49.040> click<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:51.000> we'll<00:01:51.180> draw

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
short wall up here click and we'll draw

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.399 
short wall up here click and we'll draw
from<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.200> down<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.640> double-click

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
from here down to here and double-click

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
from here down to here and double-click
so<00:01:55.409> far<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> looks<00:01:55.740> ok<00:01:56.219> looks<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.579> I've<00:01:56.729> got

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so far it looks ok looks like I've got

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.130 
so far it looks ok looks like I've got
these<00:01:57.030> perpendicular<00:01:58.189> now<00:01:59.189> let's<00:01:59.369> try<00:01:59.670> a

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
these perpendicular now let's try a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.070 
these perpendicular now let's try a
curved<00:02:01.140> wall

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.230 

round<00:02:07.080> wall<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:08.490> gonna<00:02:08.610> call<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.030> narc

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
round wall it's gonna call it a narc

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.180 
round wall it's gonna call it a narc
wall<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.750> called<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.170> round<00:02:10.320> wall<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.130> if

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
wall but it's called a round wall so if

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.940 
wall but it's called a round wall so if
I<00:02:11.310> start<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.660> point<00:02:12.960> so<00:02:13.170> I've<00:02:13.440> got<00:02:13.680> here

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I start at this point so I've got here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.020 
I start at this point so I've got here
this<00:02:14.130> mode<00:02:14.430> which<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:16.190> wall<00:02:17.190> by<00:02:17.370> radius<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
this mode which is wall by radius so I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.520 
this mode which is wall by radius so I
have<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.240> click<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.690> centre<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.020> my<00:02:19.170> radius

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
have to click at the centre of my radius

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.310 
have to click at the centre of my radius
first<00:02:20.090> let's<00:02:21.090> click<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.570> outside<00:02:22.050> face

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
first let's click on the outside face

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.820 
first let's click on the outside face
click<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.310> come<00:02:24.240> round<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:26.910> click<00:02:27.180> and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
click and come round and one click and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.890 
click and come round and one click and
that's<00:02:28.830> correct<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:29.640> pretty<00:02:29.850> close<00:02:30.120> if

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that's correct so that's pretty close if

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.420 
that's correct so that's pretty close if
you<00:02:30.990> have<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> look<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.500> my<00:02:31.650> joins<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:32.130> really

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
you have a look all my joins are really

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.940 
you have a look all my joins are really
neat<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:34.050> I've<00:02:34.260> created<00:02:34.620> these

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
neat and it's because I've created these

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.480 
neat and it's because I've created these
lines<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:36.470> which<00:02:37.470> represent<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.250> lines

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
lines here which represent the lines

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.200 
lines here which represent the lines
normal<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.180> my<00:02:39.330> wall<00:02:40.020> lines<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.740> if<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.820> want<00:02:42.030> my

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
normal to my wall lines and if I want my

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.910 
normal to my wall lines and if I want my
arc<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.050> my<00:02:43.470> walls<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:43.980> tangent<00:02:44.550> then

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
arc and my walls to be tangent then

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.170 
arc and my walls to be tangent then
that's<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.130> need<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.580> these<00:02:47.850> setting

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that's what I need to do these setting

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.470 
that's what I need to do these setting
outlines<00:02:48.480> are<00:02:48.630> really<00:02:48.870> important<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:51.360> can

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
outlines are really important so we can

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.780 
outlines are really important so we can
get<00:02:51.540> rid<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.190> now<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.640> another

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
get rid of that now there is another

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.160 
get rid of that now there is another
quicker<00:02:54.390> way<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.840> that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
quicker way to do that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
quicker way to do that
