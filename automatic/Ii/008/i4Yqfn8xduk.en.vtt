00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.049
 hi i would like to do something like this 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 I'm going to show you how I did it 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.890
 for that I'm going to start by dismantling it 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.890
 to teach all the pieces 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.520
 well this is the bench where the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.270
 Cylinder support and crankshaft 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.580
 once the electric 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.650
 that you have to leave installed with 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.470
 with respect to the crankshaft in which it controls 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.450
 the steam inlet and outlet 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.520
 the flywheel is made of iron and it 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.560
 Displays to keep the engine turning 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.130
 during the steam units 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.440
 then we have the cylinder that says 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.970
 copper with a copper tube capped from 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.300
 one of its tips and in communication with 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.490
 another tube that where Suarez is at 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.420
 boiler and bullets administered the valve 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.229
 steam inlet and outlet 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.610
 we also have the cylinder the piston 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.830
 spiritual I did it with a tube of 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.970
 aluminum but also in a tip with 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.360
 glues of the components and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.210
 the connecting rod that goes units by means of a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.990
 ball 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.920
 and here we have the valve of this output 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.190
 of it also says a small tube of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.820
 aluminum stuck to a wire guy 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.860
 so that it articulates with its stone of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.990
 drag 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.150
 when the cylinder is in one of the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.520
 ends of this classroom is covering the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.060
 Oporto step when in cylinder 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.030
 begins to lower the valve opens to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.130
 that between the steam in the center and when 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.470
 the piston 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.750
 comes forward bends opens the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.800
 exit so that steam escapes 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.450
 Exterior 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.009
 Now we are going to assemble all the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.290
 components in the bench 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.110
 first you will mount the cylinder in your 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.270
 support 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.740
 but we will not learn it until we 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.680
 the piston is mounted 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.220
 we take the intrusive piston in the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 foundation 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 and we connect it like that to the cinema 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.590
 we put you future 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.810
 and we squeeze it 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.130
 now we buy the python cylinder and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.200
 comes out 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.710
 we see that a little salt comes out is let 's say 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.480
 the sector has been a bit inside 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.170
 and he checked every time he touches it inside 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.170
 of the cylinder 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.700
 already in your position we already pressed the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.700
 clamp to hold 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:21.969
 and now to assemble the inlet valve and 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.969
 steam outlet as I said 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.890
 is full 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.220
 we put it in the written 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.450
 yes 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.830
 and in the hub of the sublime 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.600
 this bus that helps me control the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.570
 valve position 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.030
 inside the tube for this I put in 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.620
 our three forward 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.220
 4 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.900
 Y 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.440
 with this caliber that tells me I check 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.940
 that the valve is blocking the entrance 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.450
 acid 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.450
 and in it, I can tighten the bushing 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.970
 it's that easy and it's already mounted 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.240
 it needs to be proven as a finished 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.990
 I'm going to test it by connecting it to 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.990
 the pressure cooker 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.999
 As you can see, it turns perfectly 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.579
 [Music] 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.349
 now a little more 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.069
 3 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.500
 and it's over I hope you liked it
