00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to the Super Bowl so I've gotten half my

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
to the Super Bowl so I've gotten half my
prediction<00:01:53.070> correct<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> watch

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
prediction correct now we have to watch

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
prediction correct now we have to watch
the<00:01:54.930> ravens<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.649> Patriots<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.189> picked<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the ravens and Patriots I picked the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
the ravens and Patriots I picked the
ravens<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> win<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.180> game<00:01:57.420> we'll<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.079> once

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
ravens to win that game we'll see once

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
ravens to win that game we'll see once
that<00:01:58.590> game<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.750> game<00:02:01.579> um<00:02:02.780> even

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that game but you know this game um even

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810 
that game but you know this game um even
though<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.500> foreigners<00:02:04.890> did<00:02:05.159> wind<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.670> they

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
though the foreigners did wind if they

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.310 
though the foreigners did wind if they
could<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.090> played<00:02:06.329> much<00:02:06.570> better<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.110> thought

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
could have played much better I thought

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949 
could have played much better I thought
the<00:02:07.469> defense<00:02:07.890> played<00:02:08.220> horrible<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> first

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the defense played horrible in the first

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
the defense played horrible in the first
half<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> pretty<00:02:11.069> ridiculous<00:02:11.220> but

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
half if I do is pretty ridiculous but

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
half if I do is pretty ridiculous but
they've<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.660> stepped<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
they've really stepped up in this

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
they've really stepped up in this
that<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.820> Saudi<00:02:15.060> colin

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
that can have the in Saudi colin

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.940 
that can have the in Saudi colin
kaepernick<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.230> stepped<00:02:16.440> up<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
kaepernick you really stepped up in the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.430 
kaepernick you really stepped up in the
second<00:02:17.370> half<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> game<00:02:17.970> Matt<00:02:18.930> Ryan<00:02:19.200> had<00:02:19.410> a
