00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.059
 in this video I will explain how 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.760
 a regular pentagon is built 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.679
 using ruler and compass we take the 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.679
 rule we measure 4 centimeters 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.789
 we take the compass 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.070
 having as center the point ay as 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.090
 radio bird ie it measures 4 centimeters 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.090
 we draw a circle 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.200
 we draw another circumference taking 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:01.670
 as center point b and your radio sees 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.670
 that measures 4 centimeters 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.570
 now we draw a line that cuts the 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.700
 points of intersection of the two 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.220
 circumferences 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.850
 in the same way 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.760
 we draw a line perpendicular to 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.760
 bird segment from point b 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.000
 we project the bird segment to the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.000
 right side 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.820
 m is the midpoint of the bird segment 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.180
 we draw a circle that has 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.890
 center 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.830
 the point m and as the radius the intersection 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.080
 of the circumference of the right side 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:02.710
 with the straight line that went on 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.710
 perpendicular to ba from point d 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.730
 we draw another circumference that has 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.590
 as center point and as radius the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.590
 segment an 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.329
 the intersection of this circumference 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:40.160
 with a circumference of the right side 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:43.910
 the main one gives us the point c 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.880
 with the same radius having as center 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.880
 point b we draw a circle 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.230
 and we have the points of intersection of 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.880
 ie 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.810
 the regular pentagon 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.810
 it is formed by joining the abcd points
