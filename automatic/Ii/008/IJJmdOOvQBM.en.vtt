00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.349 
and there one the exhaust tip has been
dented<00:02:50.209> pretty<00:02:50.540> badly<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:53.299> a

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
dented pretty badly but it's it's like a

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.270 
dented pretty badly but it's it's like a
twenty<00:02:53.959> eight<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.230> forty<00:02:54.530> dollar<00:02:54.709> parts<00:02:55.130> so

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
twenty eight to forty dollar parts so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.690 
twenty eight to forty dollar parts so
it's<00:02:55.430> not<00:02:55.549> too<00:02:55.700> expensive<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:58.540> easily<00:02:59.540> and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
it's not too expensive that easily and

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.509 
it's not too expensive that easily and
the<00:03:01.700> car<00:03:01.970> does<00:03:02.299> have<00:03:02.540> an<00:03:02.690> oil<00:03:02.959> leak<00:03:03.230> which<00:03:04.130> kind

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
the car does have an oil leak which kind

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.309 
the car does have an oil leak which kind
of<00:03:04.609> sucks<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.859> dealer<00:03:07.190> quoted<00:03:07.810> or<00:03:08.810> should

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
of sucks but the dealer quoted or should

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.640 
of sucks but the dealer quoted or should
I<00:03:09.380> say<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.620> stealer<00:03:10.040> quoted<00:03:11.230> five<00:03:12.230> hundred

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
I say the stealer quoted five hundred

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.569 
I say the stealer quoted five hundred
dollars<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:15.200> dealership<00:03:15.709> goes<00:03:16.400> five

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
dollars so if the dealership goes five

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.710 
dollars so if the dealership goes five
hundred<00:03:16.880> dollars<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.209> I'm<00:03:17.269> sure<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> can<00:03:17.630> get

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
hundred dollars and I'm sure I can get

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.610 
hundred dollars and I'm sure I can get
it<00:03:17.840> much<00:03:17.989> less<00:03:18.170> an<00:03:18.319> independent<00:03:18.829> shop<00:03:20.620> but

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
it much less an independent shop but

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.199 
it much less an independent shop but
yeah<00:03:21.859> I<00:03:23.410> really<00:03:24.410> like<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.430> engine<00:03:25.849> revs

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
yeah I really like it the engine revs

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.460 
yeah I really like it the engine revs
sound<00:03:27.200> great<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.819> good<00:03:28.940> engine<00:03:29.269> oh<00:03:29.599> yeah

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
sound great that's a good engine oh yeah

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.300 
sound great that's a good engine oh yeah
I<00:03:30.500> forgot<00:03:30.829> about<00:03:30.889> this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
I forgot about this

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.229 
I forgot about this
so<00:03:31.430> another<00:03:32.650> slight<00:03:33.650> problem<00:03:34.130> with<00:03:34.160> this<00:03:34.430> is

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
so another slight problem with this is

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.080 
so another slight problem with this is
that<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.019> kidney<00:03:36.470> girl<00:03:36.709> has<00:03:36.889> broken<00:03:37.489> off<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:37.760> I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
that the kidney girl has broken off so I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.550 
that the kidney girl has broken off so I
just<00:03:38.180> taped<00:03:38.659> it<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:38.959> now<00:03:39.049> until<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.349> get<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
just taped it for now until I get the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.170 
just taped it for now until I get the
new<00:03:39.680> part<00:03:39.920> but<00:03:40.700> here's<00:03:40.939> the<00:03:41.060> engine<00:03:41.450> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
new part but here's the engine and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.140 
new part but here's the engine and
what<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.049> say<00:03:43.549> that's<00:03:44.549> one<00:03:44.790> hell<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.000> an

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
what can I say that's one hell of an

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.850 
what can I say that's one hell of an
engine<00:03:47.659> I'm<00:03:48.659> gonna<00:03:48.900> probably<00:03:49.439> clean<00:03:49.650> up<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
engine I'm gonna probably clean up the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.039 
engine I'm gonna probably clean up the
engine<00:03:50.189> bay<00:03:50.220> soon<00:03:50.670> when<00:03:50.939> I<00:03:50.970> get<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.239> chance

kind of here

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.950 
kind of here
it<00:04:50.070> does<00:04:50.280> need<00:04:50.460> some<00:04:50.490> paint<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:51.300> it's<00:04:51.449> not<00:04:51.630> I

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
it does need some paint but it's not I

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.640 
it does need some paint but it's not I
mean<00:04:52.440> it's<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.590> little<00:04:52.889> bad<00:04:53.070> but<00:04:54.229> it<00:04:55.229> is<00:04:55.289> very

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
mean it's a little bad but it is very

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.270 
mean it's a little bad but it is very
low<00:04:55.889> cars<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:56.490> it's<00:04:56.639> kind<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.880> expected<00:04:57.380> and

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.240 

maybe<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:02.340> can<00:05:02.460> get<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.610> little<00:05:02.820> rough<00:05:07.190> start<00:05:08.190> it

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
maybe we can get a little rough start it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:31.070 
maybe we can get a little rough start it
up

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.720

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.170 

it<00:05:37.600> does<00:05:37.810> have<00:05:37.990> nav<00:05:38.490> it's<00:05:39.490> not<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.700> best<00:05:39.910> but

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
it does have nav it's not the best but

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.680

Kardon sound speakers - it did have a
rear<00:05:48.970> speaker<00:05:49.540> that<00:05:49.780> was<00:05:50.460> right<00:05:51.460> on<00:05:51.490> top<00:05:51.790> of
