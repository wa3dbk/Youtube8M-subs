00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.610
 here is the ultimate 4 this is a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.500
 smartphone under android 4 points 2 and this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 smartphone makes it special 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.680
 to be marketed under the brand name of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 the operator bouygues telecom 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.170
 second particularity is mostly a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.109
 4g smartphone the only 4g smartphone to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.969
 operators that is marketed to a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 particularly affordable price it's a 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 device that is fine it is a device 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.469
 which is light and yet it is equipped 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.899
 a large high-definition screen of 4.7 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.149
 inches and a screen otherwise well 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.399
 bright the second big advantage of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 this device is that it is despite its 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.760
 very autonomous finesse we measured 13 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.280
 hours on call but eight hours 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 also surfing and reading 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.680
 video last important thing of course 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.199
 this device 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.650
 this smartphone is equipped with a sensor 8 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.159
 megapixels that makes photos all over 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.159
 made correct 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.990
 quite a few big flaws on this 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.240
 device I will see anyway two 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.030
 weak points it is equipped with a 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.180
 dual-core processor at 1 4 giga hertz 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.740
 it is relatively sufficient for all 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.170
 types of applications except probably 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.570
 the game so a phone that I 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.700
 would advise the gamer the second 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.610
 thing is that if he makes good 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.950
 photos the sensor does not allow to 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.140
 make videos very very fluid and 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.600
 well stabilized but hey it stays 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 passable to conclude we have with 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.410
 the ultimate 4 a smartphone quite 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.070
 functional in many areas 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.869
 but above all it is sold at a price of 230 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 euros excluding subsidy at Bouygues 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.630
 telecom and subject to subscribe 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.500
 subscription 4g the operator even makes 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.500
 phone gift
