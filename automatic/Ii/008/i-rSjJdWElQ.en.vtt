00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.430
 more video of imac de jota and we are going to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.500
 talk about the new game of jurassic park 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.240
 this time from the hand of lego creators of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.660
 great sagas of games like harry 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.070
 potter the lord of the rings' indiana 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.900
 jones star wars batman x-men among others 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 many games and that is that they have 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.369
 presented and the trailer of what will be 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.650
 its faithful to its way reproduction of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.289
 jurassic park will be four 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 movies in the game of jurassic park 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.489
 the lost world jurassic park 3 and the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.590
 last to be released on the 12th of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.559
 June tour set word I loved the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.750
 trailer I love it or maybe it's not 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.969
 the game better graphically but you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 I can assure you that the gameplay and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
 the entertainment is going to be 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.010
 I'm sure that's how it comes from the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.750
 hand of the ego as it has done with others 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 games you will not get bored we may 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.170
 down with the best graphics in the world 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.879
 but it fulfills its function which is to entertain 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.199
 and we are going to analyze some images of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.930
 trailer I do not want to analyze everything I want 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.250
 that you see it yourselves I think that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.539
 That's what we all want world 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 open for what I have seen will have 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.610
 many scenes from the movie but at 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.290
 he arrived with his wedges his thanks and good 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.790
 this first scene we see the aste 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.409
 classic nagusia one that we go to the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.060
 doctor sadler with the triceratops that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.100
 he was sick that he had the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 disease every six weeks 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 we only see on stage the doctor who 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.549
 gave a tranquilizer and the doctor 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 Asad we were going to give it to the triceratops 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.049
 sick to take the soil all very al 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.090
 then we see the fauna that also 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.159
 is with then although it seems that no 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.619
 there are some trees that plants that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.509
 are made with are not made with 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.220
 laymen and we must in the distance a path and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.250
 that seems why I tell you that it looks like a 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 graphically open world looks great 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 I'm more universal to playstation that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 Precision 4 x new generation with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 ipc and if we keep moving forward because we see 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 the famous scene from which escapes the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 tyrannosaurus rex from its enclosure is the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.340
 advice keeps the ex upside down the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.509
 ford explorer we see a lot of pieces 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 on the floor 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.720
 we have the fence in the back and crazy before 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 the notary in the foreground already what 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.049
 we had seen in the teaser 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.850
 and we keep moving in an area in the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.700
 that he and robben 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.739
 they are going to look for the dead and what is 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 wrong with the one they carry behind who is 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 You can see the black hair in between 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.200
 both of them and also when roaming around 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.959
 as we could see the movie the jeep is 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.790
 great fuck I hope and I want them to come out 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.830
 games come out ego toys from the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.390
 first part also because it is that the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 witnesses that sell is that they sell is not 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.410
 that it's not because of whims that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.530
 I'm sure the games would go 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.989
 sell but a sack I love this 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.970
 scene or you know it's the logo style 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.769
 but its profile is a reproduction 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.209
 the movies are going to be four 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.530
 I repeat again is that you forgive that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.060
 I'm super delighted because it's that 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.090
 I really wanted a game of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.519
 Jurassic park lego 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.900
 but more scenes in this case is the 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.310
 scene in which they feed the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.280
 captors of the movie gave them a 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.680
 sort of cattle and here we see the cattle 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 who is feeding the raptors 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.739
 a person does not look good if from the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.690
 left part that are giving a 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.140
 worker the reactors and then having 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.180
 after him the naked worker is super 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.799
 funny is that it is then is the roll and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.660
 So that's why I say it's a 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.180
 game that you will like or if you 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.010
 like cures and go like leo and good 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.660
 here we have another scene this time from 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.880
 the beginning of the movie when we see 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.560
 that are pushing the to a new 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.450
 velociraptor to put it inside the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.799
 corral of the reactors to one of the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.030
 workers who is the one who lifts the door 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.920
 we see robben world that is pushing 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.329
 and this is probably the beginning 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.310
 of the game 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.750
 that is, it is a pass, we see the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.190
 interior background of india we have not given 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.410
 about those who are trying 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.690
 monitor the abductor in case something happens 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.490
 how the movie finally happens and good 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.410
 this also wants to uncover us a lot 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.060
 of the ego trailer I prefer you see it 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.760
 you have left me in the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.080
 description a link and good by changing a 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.610
 little of the lego game we also have 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.070
 a monopoly of pounds equal in that 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.590
 I suppose we will buy dinosaurs 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.280
 this just forum we imagine that 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.020
 it's official and it's not a cure 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.910
 currada by the way and good a couple of 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.220
 photos of the filming of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.840
 from the movie here we see the jeep that 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.030
 are going to leave the jeeps of the old 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.980
 movie we see that we are a decorated 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.740
 from the jungle we see one of the teams and 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.770
 this image has gone fast for me 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.840
 twitter can be seen in the spy image 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.820
 of the set of shooting we see several cars 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.600
 covered with tarpaulins and we can do homework 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.400
 that some of them are what we have to 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.010
 have the shape they have covered 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.720
 the cars and one of them is curious 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.820
 because he is a ford explorer of the 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.370
 movie you can see in the circle inside 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.530
 that there are two cars so nothing is 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.850
 a short video are news either 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.410
 I want to dissipate a lot to the TV of the ego 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.180
 but is that with the music that the super 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.890
 epic so take a look and I 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.240
 you say what you think it's worth we see each other 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.240
 the next video a greeting
