hi mr. Simon once again
I've<00:00:03.659> got<00:00:03.899> all<00:00:04.050> the<00:00:04.200> exclusive<00:00:04.529> facts<00:00:05.220> about

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
I've got all the exclusive facts about

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.390 
I've got all the exclusive facts about
the<00:00:05.850> upcoming<00:00:06.299> iPad<00:00:06.799> surprisingly<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:08.310> a

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
the upcoming iPad surprisingly it's a

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.330 
the upcoming iPad surprisingly it's a
bit<00:00:08.520> thicker<00:00:08.850> and<00:00:09.120> slightly<00:00:09.960> heavier<00:00:10.560> but

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
bit thicker and slightly heavier but

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.820 
bit thicker and slightly heavier but
therefore<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.180> comes<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:12.810> a<00:00:12.840> free<00:00:13.140> helium

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
therefore it comes with a free helium

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.339 
therefore it comes with a free helium
app<00:00:13.980> which<00:00:14.640> almost<00:00:15.120> makes<00:00:15.810> you<00:00:15.900> forget<00:00:15.960> about
