 The Mermaid had six sisters

 The mermaid was the most beautiful of them and sang well. 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:44.409
 The Mermaid never saw the ocean. 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:44.409
 It was because my father, Dragon King, did not allow it. 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.780
 I want to see the world above the sea 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.750

 The princess went up to the sea and saw the prince who was in the harbor at sea . 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.190
 The mermaid stopped at the first glance against the prince. 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.090

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:43.739
 And the mermaid came before the princes of breath wake up 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.739
 The mermaid looked at the prince from a distance and thought, 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.090
 If I were a lot of people, I could marry my prince. 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:03.799
 The princess and his servants took the prince who woke up to his palace in the neighboring country that passed by. 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.799
 The mermaid was forced to look sadly . 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.070
 The Mermaid Princess wants to see the prince very gratefully. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.070

 The witch said with a scary face. 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.880

 Princess Tori was awake in her voice 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:41.680
 Because I gave a voice to the witch, I could not speak because I became dumb. 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.680
 I was just looking at the prince. 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:56.080
 The prince took the Little Mermaid to the martyrdom pitifully .
