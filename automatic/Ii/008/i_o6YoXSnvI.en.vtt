00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 team lie 2 series dog position 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 man and hands with food so we 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.299
 disassembled the movement of the dog when 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:22.260
 we are working on the command to let me down 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:25.910
 lie or lie all lie well also 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.840
 we quickly galloped across Europe 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 possibility in various ways 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 dog laying but in order for you 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.120
 well successfully trained the dog team 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.450
 lie that is the very initial stage 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.480
 styling need to say more about the position about 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.050
 relations in human space and 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 dogs 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.530
 that is, everyone knows such a thing as 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.770
 the main position is when the dog is sitting 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 near near the legs and in the same position 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.460
 finds near this we have called 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.320
 the main position to sit there is the front 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.420
 position is also known to many, and it is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.689
 big mistake of many people who 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 begin to work out commands to sit 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.330
 lie stand here being in this 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.930
 position because so work 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.950
 inconvenient somewhat more convenient to work 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.369
 here in this position but here if the dog 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.220
 it doesn't go down right away you start 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 pull off and hands 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.470
 unstable dog the dick is the most correct 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.540
 the most 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.900
 initial position is when the line 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.329
 shoulders parallel to the body of the dog's legs 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 even wide apart in the knees 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.780
 slightly bend your legs and then you 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 get wherever you need 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.140
 and you are very easy to handle styling. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.570
 dogs 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.649
 let's say sits doggy we lower feed 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.460
 the dog lay down 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.770
 stand dog is also lowered feed 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.840
 we iron 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.440
 if the dog will move somewhere 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.900
 easy to get denmark i have this position 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.239
 Parallel is the most important thing 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.810
 initial position when working 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.720
 teams lie sit and stand 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.260
 another position convenient for work 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.030
 intermediate between this one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.780
 parallel positions in which I am now 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 I am 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 stand and frontal positions ie 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.410
 position let's say so angular when you have 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.160
 this is the foot that stands in front 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 paws stand dogs not allows it 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.180
 pass and this leg 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.519
 deployed here and so here we stand, and an angle 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.400
 work here lie sit well 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:56.150
 stand when you start with a dog 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.329
 work complex sit stand she 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.819
 can shift 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.670
 better and and straighten that is better 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.400
 take the time to get from 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.920
 good job dogs 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.650
 direction than to be satisfied with what 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.310
 she is at 0 needle and glory those god 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.459
 Now lie down again I will list 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.389
 the positions that were talking about mean 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.609
 main position lie frontal 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:30.350
 position lie parallel position 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:37.040
 shoulder line parallel to the dog's body 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.840
 lie angular position besides position 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.290
 regarding dog location 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.190
 dog space and man is important 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.139
 hand position with feed or with ball 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.630
 usually with puppies and at the beginning 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:54.349
 stage we work with food 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:58.069
 it means there is a pointing position when 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.639
 we feed around the nose of the dog and we feed 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.400
 show dogs with food 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:09.120
 trajectory of movement and and nose and and muzzle 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.930
 and controlling the dog's head we 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:19.650
 but let's say so largely control the body 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.070
 dogs sit means have a hand position with 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.130
 feed 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.350
 Orientation is something that very often 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.310
 people do 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.160
 after watching some picture books 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.240
 begin to shrink and lay the dog 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.130
 here so sweeping sit like that 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.590
 that's sweeping movements but how 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.870
 the rule is not a trained dog which 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.990
 there are still no hard stereotypes like her 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.449
 must sit down go to bed and get up she 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.810
 turns as you like because when. 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:55.590
 here here she can and the taxi driver so 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.800
 so is the same with styling so this 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.720
 position orienting it is better already 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.449
 use when we say we dog 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.270
 tied and work at a distance 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.320
 complex and 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.820
 able there is a little dog 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.479
 prompt when you when you only 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.380
 start learning the best the best 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.349
 right this is a tight muzzle contact and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.830
 hands that is you hooked like 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:30.900
 this dog's nose and drag it where 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.970
 you need to sit another arm position with 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.000
 feed is the lack of feed 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:41.129
 the removal of this feed from the situation that is 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.459
 we put the dog form took on 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:46.949
 removed that is, of course the coin mountain 

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:49.379
 the dog knows where he is, since she is his 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.949
 don't see it then all the same not so much on 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:56.159
 it affects there is a position let's say 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:06:00.139
 feed provocation not even feed 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:05.479
 motivational object when you lie 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:08.509
 Dog little holidays provoke 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:12.289
 do not force to lie or sit 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:15.529
 then repeat pointing 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:20.939
 orientation of the removal of feed and 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:23.369
 provocation lie why is it important 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:28.699
 be aware of these 4 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:31.199
 hand position because very often 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.999
 involuntarily putting the dog left 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.379
 by hand 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:37.079
 working there with a leash or just with 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:39.749
 hand people lose control over the right 

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:41.369
 arm and right arm instead 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:44.279
 direct the dog in the correct position 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:47.129
 or target at least her there though 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:48.929
 preferred guidance starts 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.509
 dog provoke this feed 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:54.269
 stand that is a dog for example 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:56.039
 there will be a person that's all loaded with how 

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:58.019
 he will lay her hands here he 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.749
 begins to lay hands and food 

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:03.240
 stays here but it's a dog to lay down 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:06.659
 because she is not trained on styling she 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.149
 and so it makes the other dog stand 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:13.019
 she lays down will not be especially if 

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:15.809
 still become stand especially if this hand 

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.969
 so here is spinning, spinning that is 

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:20.819
 when you work with a dog 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.829
 well, it is very important to just know where 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:26.959
 where are your hands where are you 

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:28.380
 the position of the dog and if given to us 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:34.790
 set 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:37.790
 and you sonatina caressed it is free and 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.790
 set
