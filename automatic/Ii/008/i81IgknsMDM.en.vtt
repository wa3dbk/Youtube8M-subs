at night is a limitation in motion

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.040 
at night is a limitation in motion
because<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> no<00:01:00.269> longer<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> smooth

because you no longer have a smooth

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.719 
because you no longer have a smooth
joint<00:01:01.350> surface<00:01:01.889> and<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.249> have<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.519> bones

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
joint surface and you have the bones

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.700 
joint surface and you have the bones
rubbing<00:01:03.149> against<00:01:03.510> each<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.749> that<00:01:04.050> joint

rubbing against each other that joint
surface<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> irregular<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.000> ultimately

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
surface is irregular and ultimately

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.719 
surface is irregular and ultimately
leads<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.200> reduction<00:01:07.469> in<00:01:07.740> motion<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
leads to a reduction in motion it's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
leads to a reduction in motion it's
reduced<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.299> only<00:01:09.570> because<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.110> pain

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
reduced not only because of the pain

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.889 
reduced not only because of the pain
that<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> patient<00:01:11.399> feels<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:12.329> also<00:01:12.479> because

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
that the patient feels but also because

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.300 
that the patient feels but also because
the<00:01:13.049> bones<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.409> rubbing<00:01:13.649> against<00:01:13.920> each<00:01:14.070> other

the bones are rubbing against each other

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300 
the bones are rubbing against each other
and<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.210> form<00:01:15.450> bone<00:01:15.750> spurs<00:01:16.110> things<00:01:16.920> these

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
those bone spurs can limit motion and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
those bone spurs can limit motion and
when<00:01:24.539> that<00:01:24.630> motion<00:01:24.899> starts<00:01:25.409> being<00:01:25.619> limited
