00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello all my here I continue 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.189
 review the mods from my build today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.590
 My eyes fell on a mod called 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.790
 backpacks he adds the name is understandable 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.180
 backpacks and so fishermen actually 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.670
 only two types but there is something to tell about 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 even better to say three types but in general 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 First things first 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.230
 we want a backpack what do we do but 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 how to take the skin and form their chest 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 we arrange this skin and get the usual 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.329
 backpack only this backpack or other 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 fashion conflicts okay I'll show up on 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.149
 An example of this backpack here is his recipe from 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.850
 eight skin we get and such a penny 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.530
 I can’t say it is clear I will ban the recipe 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 but most likely because of squinting it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.379
 I like the backpack more which 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 more beautiful and now when lead lead us 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.030
 eat and hands we can open it by clicking 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.100
 great-grandson of the mouse and now we see him 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
 like a chest that is, he schedules 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 twenty seven slots 27 item types 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.949
 items he can hold this our 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.229
 regular backpack 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.540
 what else can we do with it we 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.869
 we can click shift and right click and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.479
 now we can pass it on as cool 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 for example, and we now have a backpack 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.100
 called differently what else can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.030
 do with this backpack 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 we can paint it for example in 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.380
 pink color can also paint it 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 Immediately when creating make it pink 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 you are such a recipe is no longer in conflict 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.560
 here we have two pink backpacks one 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 called cube and to another standard on 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.930
 pink backpack and what else 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.640
 well, not a tournament, he is not pink so 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.990
 Violet 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 what else can we do with them can we 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.299
 improve it we can improve it with 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.149
 using a torrent leader this translates 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.060
 like thick skin and 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.649
 and this tent leider is made is bound 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.490
 laser that is like leather 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.350
 which is made from yarn 7 pieces and 2 leather 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.540
 that is, the skin already needs two times more 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.789
 all clear 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.989
 make tank leader fry blunt laser 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.760
 stoves and can improve our backpack like this 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 here that is get immediately 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 backpack of the color that we want and 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.609
 with this name we will not lose 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.159
 here and also not lost items in it 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.650
 let's show it to you war 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:33.450
 With a backpack, we put the skin like this and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.170
 now we have better our cube so now we have 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.150
 there is a backpack in which there are no items well 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.810
 we take a cube we put it the skin we improve 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.159
 it immediately using than clever and 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.400
 we get our cube the same name 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.400
 but items in it are also preserved 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.240
 troll me game 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.240
 better heed the subject while improving 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.150
 our backpack or immediately do 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.460
 superior backpack is the ultimate backpack 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.210
 done as you understand and become a leader 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.580
 our sturdy skin right away we can it 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.930
 also paint here just get our 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.060
 backpack pink purple big can 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.070
 immediately make and big that is such 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.200
 here is a backpack and a little leave than 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.200
 improve small don't know it is more profitable 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.630
 also this mod adds an ender backpack 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.720
 which is spinning like a normal backpack it 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.750
 cannot be improved and is also used 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.520
 interest in der chest let me get you 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.140
 I will prove that it can not be improved by some 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.090
 that is, it would be a little bit 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.100
 cheater on because this backpack 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.320
 allows you to enter our in der chest 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.260
 see even here it is written interest 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.110
 although and r &amp; b as we hold in hand and so 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.650
 I have an ender made clean and 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.130
 Now we can open our interbackpack 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.709
 our ender backpack and see the contents 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.750
 of our inter you see it very often 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.580
 convenient we can leave many, many 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.860
 backpacks at the base keep yourself friend this 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.180
 one truth his craft is quite expensive 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.660
 but still 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.930
 and if necessary, take the necessary backpack 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.930
 with the desired object something like this 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:34.100
 Now until a small bug can not be in the inter 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.430
 hour put a backpack that is that is 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.040
 you can’t put a backpack in a backpack 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.030
 can put this very backpack in 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.740
 interest and will work take 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.290
 open something take and put 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.990
 back we will not be able to such a small 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.470
 pak need to mean fix the developer 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.380
 the fact that you can not put these backpacks winder 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:03.020
 part well yes this russia right away 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.360
 came up with exploit it worked ok so 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 The last tea will tell about this mod so 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.830
 these are the last two backpacks 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.950
 backpacks workbenches we craft them according to this 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.320
 recipe that is all intuitive 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:22.450
 use the workbench and use the skin as 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.100
 usually we cutters get backpack workbench 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.660
 who can do anything like 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.000
 usually as usual workbench only 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.550
 figurative is understandable only why 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.770
 backpack but because you can improve it 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.520
 it can be improved in this way and 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.150
 here we will see the same 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.140
 workbench 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.480
 crafting window will be complemented by others 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.580
 storage windows that is here we can 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.340
 immediately store leather talent and make 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.700
 backpacks as well as in the example of 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:56.240

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.060
 power here you can immediately craft 22 gpk 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.820
