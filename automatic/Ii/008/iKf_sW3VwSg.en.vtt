00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
but in this case all we got was the case

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.610 
but in this case all we got was the case

we will talk about the style of the case
you<00:02:15.450> guys<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.260> has<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.129> urban

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
armor gear logo in the center and then

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.199 
armor gear logo in the center and then
you<00:02:19.709> see<00:02:19.890> these<00:02:20.040> nice<00:02:20.310> rivets<00:02:20.819> here<00:02:21.000> which

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
you see these nice rivets here which

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.940 
you see these nice rivets here which
really<00:02:21.360> give<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.690> an<00:02:21.780> industrial<00:02:22.470> look

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
really give it an industrial look

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.619

you have grips on the side which is

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.630 
you have grips on the side which is
great<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.440> note<00:02:25.590> 5<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.159> an

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
great because the note 5 is an

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.729 
great because the note 5 is an
incredibly<00:02:27.090> slippery<00:02:27.510> device<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
incredibly slippery device so with the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.220 
incredibly slippery device so with the
all<00:02:28.890> glass<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.610> metal<00:02:29.970> design<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:30.780> super

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
all glass and metal design it is super

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.619 
all glass and metal design it is super
slippery<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.489> takes<00:02:32.760> away<00:02:32.970> all<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.420> that

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
slippery and this takes away all of that

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.180 
slippery and this takes away all of that
slips<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.379> one<00:02:34.530> thing<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:34.799> really<00:02:35.010> like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
slips so one thing that I really like

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.649 
slips so one thing that I really like
also<00:02:35.610> about<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:36.000> case<00:02:36.239> when<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.569> talking

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
also about this case when we're talking

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.800 
also about this case when we're talking
about<00:02:36.840> design<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:38.250> little<00:02:38.519> dip<00:02:38.849> in<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
about design is this little dip in the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.720 
about design is this little dip in the
back<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.349> case<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.129> doesn't<00:02:41.190> seem<00:02:41.549> like

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
back of the case it doesn't seem like

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.100 
back of the case it doesn't seem like
much<00:02:41.909> but<00:02:42.420> when<00:02:42.540> you're<00:02:42.659> actually<00:02:42.900> holding

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
much but when you're actually holding

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.319 
much but when you're actually holding
the<00:02:43.379> phone<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.620> your<00:02:43.860> hand<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.760> gives<00:02:45.180> it

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
the phone in your hand it just gives it

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.360 
the phone in your hand it just gives it
that<00:02:45.390> really<00:02:45.930> nice<00:02:46.140> feel

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that really nice feel

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.069 
that really nice feel
I<00:02:47.400> don't<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.790> how<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> explain<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.959> it

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
I don't know how to explain it but it

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.380 
I don't know how to explain it but it
had<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.290> same<00:02:49.650> little<00:02:49.920> Ridge<00:02:50.129> in<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.849> galaxy

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
had that same little Ridge in the galaxy

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.420 
had that same little Ridge in the galaxy
s6<00:02:51.780> edge<00:02:52.019> case<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.769> really<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
s6 edge case and I just really like the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.309 
s6 edge case and I just really like the
way<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.700> phone<00:02:53.849> feels<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> hand<00:02:54.540> with

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
way the phone feels in the hand with

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.690 
way the phone feels in the hand with
that<00:02:55.470> little<00:02:55.709> Ridge<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.160> helps<00:02:56.430> with

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
that little Ridge it just helps with

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520 
that little Ridge it just helps with
gripping<00:02:57.239> your<00:02:57.510> phone<00:02:57.720> holding<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.440> your

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
gripping your phone holding on to your

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.930

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
on a device like the s6 edge and the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.869

the<00:03:20.010> way<00:03:20.130> around<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.609> I<00:03:20.669> think<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.090> just

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
the way around and I think that is just

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.150 
the way around and I think that is just
meant<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.780> protect<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.859> glass<00:03:23.099> from

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
meant to protect the glass from

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.370 
meant to protect the glass from
scratching<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:24.959> we'll<00:03:25.079> do<00:03:25.169> here<00:03:25.319> is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
scratching so what we'll do here is

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.339 
scratching so what we'll do here is
we'll<00:03:25.560> put<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.889> phone<00:03:26.099> inside<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.730> case<00:03:27.349> nice

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
we'll put the phone inside the case nice

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.860 
we'll put the phone inside the case nice
