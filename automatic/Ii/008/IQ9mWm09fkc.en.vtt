00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.520 

that<00:05:04.970> first<00:05:05.210> method<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.690> showed<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:06.110> involves

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
that first method I showed you involves

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.840 
that first method I showed you involves
getting<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.860> lot<00:05:07.010> of<00:05:07.130> height<00:05:07.340> which<00:05:07.520> makes<00:05:07.730> you

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
getting a lot of height which makes you

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.780 
getting a lot of height which makes you
vulnerable<00:05:08.000> for<00:05:08.630> damage<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:10.280> second<00:05:10.669> method

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
vulnerable for damage the second method

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.340 
vulnerable for damage the second method
involves<00:05:11.180> skimming<00:05:11.600> around<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.930> back<00:05:12.080> ramp

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
involves skimming around the back ramp

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:24.189 
involves skimming around the back ramp
which<00:05:12.650> makes<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:12.979> a<00:05:13.040> bit<00:05:13.190> safer<00:05:23.050> another<00:05:24.050> way

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
which makes it a bit safer another way

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.870 
which makes it a bit safer another way
to<00:05:24.260> do<00:05:24.470> it<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.919> just<00:05:25.100> drop<00:05:25.310> down<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.760> launch

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
to do it is to just drop down and launch

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:43.330 
to do it is to just drop down and launch
yourself<00:05:26.060> from<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.479> launch<00:05:26.660> pad<00:05:42.100> all<00:05:43.100> of

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
yourself from the launch pad all of

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.860 
yourself from the launch pad all of
these<00:05:43.490> approaches<00:05:43.970> can<00:05:44.000> also<00:05:44.240> be<00:05:44.419> used<00:05:44.660> as<00:05:44.810> a

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
these approaches can also be used as a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.620 
these approaches can also be used as a
CT<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:46.070> just<00:05:46.340> takes<00:05:46.550> an<00:05:46.700> extra<00:05:47.000> boost<00:05:47.120> due<00:05:47.510> to

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
CT it just takes an extra boost due to

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.330 
CT it just takes an extra boost due to
the<00:05:47.750> alignment<00:05:48.169> of<00:05:48.229> the<00:05:48.320> CT<00:05:48.620> in<00:05:48.770> these<00:05:48.950> forms

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
the alignment of the CT in these forms

00:05:49.340 --> 00:06:03.159 
the alignment of the CT in these forms
and<00:06:00.550> that<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.729> it<00:06:01.910> this<00:06:02.419> is<00:06:02.479> my<00:06:02.780> first

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
and that is it this is my first
