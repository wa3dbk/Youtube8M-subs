00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.009
 set let's look first at 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.090
 stick figure 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.090
 we have such a figure 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 his face is the same as the first one 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.130
 So you see, even the micro fighter you have 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.500
 every helmet well 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 everyone has a micro fighter job for these 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.759
 three were on just pistols well to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.729
 they didn't take up much space i'm so 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.420
 I understand that here it is now here such 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.910
 Well, the new suit with the old at the old is not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.730
 there was this this respiratory thing 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:26.040
 And here are the prints for me and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.000
 stayed with this one on the helmet let's 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.180

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.989
 minifigures 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.569
 of our 3 video reviews stand and here 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:44.790
 take a look at exactly this one 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:56.430
 boy here he is what does he have 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:03:00.329
 there are rockets this time but they shoot 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:07.889
 sometimes good sometimes fluff everyone has their own 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:11.910
 method as they say start so here i am 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:17.850
 found 2 let's see what we have 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 then comes here such things from which 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.959
 he shoots which are made of levers 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:29.160
 These are cool parts 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:33.630
 behind the lever there are still these things well cry 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:39.690
 smart function function it is not so 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:44.250
 much he can do with wings and here 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.710
 I also forgot to show in this video 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.110
 that this one also turns 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.800
 that is, for example, u so we live oh 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.870
 you can also ruin it a bit 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.910
 Well, in principle, you can do it like this 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.610
 clever and 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.380
 and this one no longer has an extra 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.720
 here but in general ban everyone thanks for
