00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.379
 today I will make you a little 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.070
 a video that I must make you 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.110
 months and months ago 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.969
 I really did not have the time the months 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.260
 have followed each other and then I do not need to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 do this review there so it'll be a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.820
 product review city woman 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.820
 you had already talked about it after you 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.350
 have done my vorkapic review to know 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.599
 that if you have not seen the video I 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 do a little topo so the little topo 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 is that there was a time when I would go 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.510
 keratin my long hair very well 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 supported however after the phase 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.280
 keratin I lost my hair 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 a lot of hair I think 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.430
 I lost a lot of mass 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.239
 I have more ground than I had before 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.579
 wasting my hair I was just doing that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.129
 that I had a huge chance of hair 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.739
 so it was just horrible to live so 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.329
 I started following that the cure for 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.800
 persimmon for three months I have it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 also did a review 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.050
 do not hesitate go watch it question 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.789
 dirty hair loss did not help me 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 all I took my hurt between the naves 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.129
 chanel ramassis I said here I am 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.320
 take things 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.610
 hair is more possible to that of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 is no longer hair on the head 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.960
 and the pharmacist did me very well 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.610
 advised me asked the same question on 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 my hair loss and she told me 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.250
 therefore recommended the product 6 tiffaneau 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.700
 it's a cure to take so it's a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.770
 pure which costs 19 euros 90 so to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.049
 inside I had you I believe 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.119
 about 5 platelets like this so he 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.110
 have to take the treatment until the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.729
 end of his platelets 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.290
 it does not need you anymore and the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 sorry so here if I wanted to ride 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.800
 that's because my roommate 6 also 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.900
 the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.390
 tablet looks as if there is any 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.250
 four learn a day so a 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 platelet let's say that these five days 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.020
 its surroundings i think of week the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.150
 treatment something like that so 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.560
 I took me two mornings and the 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.250
 evening like it is a complement 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 alimentary 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.960
 I remember a bit like Ford Kalfin he 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.330
 really have to eat properly 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.040
 for it to work otherwise you do not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.660
 will not see the effects for that does not 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.030
 not grow hair it just makes 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.480
 stop hair loss 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.610
 so that's based on this style of zinc and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.620
 of arginine so there is 120 included but 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 now it's a cure that does not cost 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.370
 not very expensive unlike two shots 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.940
 sure against it could be found in 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.520
 pharmacy 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.500
 those tubes that I write until the end and 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.580
 that I recommend friends percent being 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.030
 given that today 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.560
 and well after 4-5 months after finishing 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.240
 this treatment there yes I know I am 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 really very late 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.560
 I do not have any problem falling from 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.120
 hair and if I had to have some 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.220
 will resume this product six months this is 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.850
 something that absolutely helped me 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.260
 we talked a lot and asked for 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.360
 questions about supplements 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.239
 food and hair so at 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.100
 know that I have not noticed any 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.770
 changes taking strong cap is 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.560
 also fan on my hair there is some 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.000
 many who are a bit reluctant by 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 report to that because it's normal 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.690
 when the hair pushes the waves 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.770
 inches and the hairs grow so yes 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.410
 everything is connected and everything grows 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.570
 and I personally did not have 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.860
 something really blatant I'm 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.480
 am not saying yeah shit here that I 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.760
 feel like you back from the steering wheel 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.280
 stif barmon like that was really a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.100
 great she for me money I think 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.560
 that it is something that I 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.270
 will resume small there it's done 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.850
 maybe common six months that I have 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.440
 stopped strong kapil 4 that I finished 7th 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.050
 so I think I'll start a 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.900
 new cure to strengthen my hair 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.730
 I waited I wanted to leave 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.239
 about three months before 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.560
 start new cure so I'm not going 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.260
 take a cure neither to grow 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.400
 hair nor to stop 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.200
 fall on the contrary had hair 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.519
 enormously pushed thanks to strong capital 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.680
 I have not bad but I do not know if they have 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.140
 marked but I have a lot of small 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.239
 hair all over the head game i'm trying 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.109
 to hide them but here is the 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.840
 maintenance that I want to do it's 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.250
 really fortified my hair locates 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.200
 she was a great help wanting 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.409
 to convince a lot if you have the 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.599
 hair that does not fall off the hair that 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.760
 is breaking I love you to say it to 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.909
 from the moment when mister breaks 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.019
 is that there is a little oops i did 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.120
 directions and all that on the hair - 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.979
 really when he falls and we saw 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.530
 really the hair root on the 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.180
 hair the hair fell entirely 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.000
 not by piece I really had them 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.590
 hair that was starting from the root and I 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.639
 talked about hair in mass so 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.380
 really it's something that I 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.810
 advise this with the same concern you 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.599
 have falling hair and not 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.120
 to break me I took them as I 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.750
 wanted to say frankly morning there's no 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.460
 great thing to say I did not have any effects 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.120
 negative effects following this product there 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.970
 lets the facts was instantaneous almost 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.900
 instant after maybe one 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.880
 week is good 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.490
 joyent is really a difference between 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.030
 before and after taking 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.440
 tablets 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.240
 I had falling hair and less 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.220
 in less and then there was a period where 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.510
 they were falling at all at the end of the 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.760
 treatment my hair did not fall anymore 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.349
 at all and then little by little it is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.610
 regulate but I want to started to 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.220
 fall my hair fall so 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.740
 normally as we lose all 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.599
 hair all day long 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.340
 but frankly it's normal I'm 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.790
 more worried to see my hair falling 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.400
 so 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.110
 I was going to cry to everyone because I want 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.190
 to fall I say to myself I'm losing 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.620
 the head so that so 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.150
 So that's learning so two 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.310
 times a day I have not much to you 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.630
 to say it's not a special journal 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.140
 I just wanted to share a 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:37.040
 sort of good deals with you being 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.380
 given that city ​​woman really fed up 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.110
 really helped south of my life the 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.590
 keratin it was to do again I do not know 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.630
 not if i get the concept a place 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.570
 is great but they lose their hair 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.130
 it was really a bit awful for 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.390
 me even if today I am really 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.920
 happy loops that I have them 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.850
 are a lot more relaxed a lot 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.290
 more of which table in quotation marks here 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.070
 it's pretty cool 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.200
 then all that is strong kapil people 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.670
 start again if you want to do 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.680
 push your hair to grow your 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.330
 nails it's not going you it's neither stronger 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.550
 nor did anything just know pushed 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.170
 and after that I had a nice inch 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.240
 and his doors he really does to 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.830
 hair story that's hers 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.930
 stops pushing his hair for no 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.240
 next they do not hold so that's it 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.790
 it's true that it was pretty short 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.320
 hair actually I do not know what 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.630
 finish on this product is true that 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.980
 when you have a product anyway 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.470
 do not know what to say when 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.840
 she does not always have a pavement to say there 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.960
 the product is self-sufficient 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.430
 totally met my expectations I 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.530
 wanted my drop stops she 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.360
 stopped and there now I'm going to try 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.310
 to take care of my hair if you 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.780
 want to know 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.190
 or rather to have a review on my 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.170
 next cure do not hesitate to make me 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.310
 to know if it's something that ends 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.050
 by you that is because when even 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.610
 it's a lot of reviews on the 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.330
 hair that I do not hesitate too 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.020
 to their measure 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.790
 it's important to me so go and if 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.560
 I hope with all the little races 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.940
 short videos liked it I make 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.940
 kisses and Thursday harnessed
