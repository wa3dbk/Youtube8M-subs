00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
when I spread a bicycle deck it's much

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.319 
when I spread a bicycle deck it's much

the<00:02:52.540> cards<00:02:52.810> come<00:02:52.959> out<00:02:53.139> and<00:02:53.379> I<00:02:53.439> get<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> much<00:02:53.859> more

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
the cards come out and I get a much more

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.589 
the cards come out and I get a much more
even<00:02:54.280> spread<00:02:54.730> with<00:02:54.909> these<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.299> little<00:02:55.480> bit

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
even spread with these it's a little bit

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.740 
even spread with these it's a little bit
tougher<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> control<00:02:56.349> so<00:02:57.389> other<00:02:58.389> than<00:02:58.599> that

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
tougher to control so other than that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.179 
tougher to control so other than that
and<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.930> fact<00:03:02.139> that<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.379> backs<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.859> think

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
and the fact that the backs I think

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.140 
and the fact that the backs I think
personally<00:03:03.609> are<00:03:03.760> kind<00:03:04.389> of<00:03:04.449> ugly<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.969> to

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
personally are kind of ugly this is to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.069 
personally are kind of ugly this is to
me<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.449> just<00:03:07.959> like<00:03:08.169> a<00:03:08.199> normal<00:03:09.569> bicycle<00:03:10.569> deck

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
me is just like a normal bicycle deck

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.550 
me is just like a normal bicycle deck
being<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.489> cambric<00:03:13.090> finish<00:03:13.510> like<00:03:14.199> I<00:03:14.230> said<00:03:14.469> it's

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
being a cambric finish like I said it's

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.099 
being a cambric finish like I said it's
a<00:03:14.590> little<00:03:14.799> more<00:03:14.949> slick<00:03:15.449> you<00:03:16.449> see<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.750> cards

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
a little more slick you see the cards

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.839 
a little more slick you see the cards
eat<00:03:17.230> they<00:03:17.379> spread<00:03:17.949> pretty<00:03:18.189> well<00:03:18.430> they<00:03:18.639> fan

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
eat they spread pretty well they fan

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.699 
eat they spread pretty well they fan
pretty<00:03:19.090> well<00:03:19.299> so<00:03:19.659> I<00:03:19.689> mean<00:03:19.989> it'd<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.439> decent

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
pretty well so I mean it'd be a decent

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.460 
pretty well so I mean it'd be a decent
deck<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:21.370> or<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.419> you're<00:03:22.569> going<00:03:22.659> to<00:03:22.750> do<00:03:22.930> magic

deck for or if you're going to do magic

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.469 
deck for or if you're going to do magic
with<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:23.859> would<00:03:24.189> I<00:03:24.400> would<00:03:24.579> recommend<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.239> deck

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
with I would I would recommend this deck

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.479 
with I would I would recommend this deck
for<00:03:25.509> that<00:03:25.810> if<00:03:26.379> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.680> get<00:03:26.799> past<00:03:26.979> looking<00:03:27.370> at

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
for that if you can get past looking at

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.509 
for that if you can get past looking at
the<00:03:27.549> backs<00:03:27.790> that's<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.930> only<00:03:29.139> part<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:29.769> I

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
the backs that's the only part that I

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.580 
the backs that's the only part that I
can't<00:03:30.909> quite<00:03:31.060> quite<00:03:31.569> get<00:03:31.750> past<00:03:32.019> but<00:03:32.229> I<00:03:32.349> did

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
can't quite quite get past but I did

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.819 
can't quite quite get past but I did
have<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:33.489> did<00:03:34.000> have<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.180> few<00:03:34.389> requests<00:03:35.019> for<00:03:35.199> a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
have I did have a few requests for a

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.649 
have I did have a few requests for a
review<00:03:36.280> of<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.609> deck<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.030> figured<00:03:37.389> I'd<00:03:37.509> go

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
review of this deck so I figured I'd go

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:38.849 
review of this deck so I figured I'd go
ahead<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.989> pick<00:03:38.139> one<00:03:38.319> up<00:03:38.409> I<00:03:38.560> thought<00:03:38.709> there

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
ahead and pick one up I thought there

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.140 
ahead and pick one up I thought there
was<00:03:38.919> something<00:03:39.099> really<00:03:39.280> special<00:03:39.400> about<00:03:39.879> them

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
was something really special about them

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.270 
was something really special about them
but<00:03:40.299> obviously<00:03:40.840> there's<00:03:41.620> not<00:03:41.889> much<00:03:42.099> that's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
but obviously there's not much that's

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.300 
but obviously there's not much that's
too<00:03:42.519> special<00:03:42.939> about<00:03:43.150> these<00:03:43.389> it's<00:03:43.659> just<00:03:43.750> your

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
too special about these it's just your

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.849 
too special about these it's just your
standard<00:03:45.310> B<00:03:45.489> deck<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.409> said<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.739> can

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
standard B deck and like I said you can

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.920 
standard B deck and like I said you can
see<00:03:48.009> it's<00:03:48.159> not<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.370> diamondback<00:03:49.030> deck<00:03:49.540> like<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
see it's not a diamondback deck like the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.949 
see it's not a diamondback deck like the
box<00:03:50.169> indicates<00:03:50.939> it<00:03:51.939> is<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.349> wins<00:03:53.349> deck<00:03:53.650> and

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
box indicates it is a wins deck and

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.209 
box indicates it is a wins deck and
other<00:03:55.959> than<00:03:56.229> that<00:03:56.409> there's<00:03:56.650> not<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.829> whole<00:03:57.040> lot

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
other than that there's not a whole lot

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.559 
other than that there's not a whole lot
I<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.489> tell<00:03:57.699> you<00:03:57.849> about<00:03:57.939> them<00:03:58.829> other<00:03:59.829> than<00:04:00.009> the

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
I can tell you about them other than the
